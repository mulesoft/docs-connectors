:page-aliases: connectors::sap/sap-s4hana-soap-connector-reference.adoc

Support Category: https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#anypoint-connectors[Premium]

Anypoint Connector for SAP S/4HANA SOAP provides full support for the SOAP APIs exposed by SAP S/4HANA ERP and from version 2.1.x provides support also for SAP S/4HANA On-Premise ERP.

The main class of an extension is the entry point from which configurations, connection providers, operations, and sources are declared.

== Configurations

[[Config]]
=== Config

==== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x
| Connection a| * <<Config_BasicAuthentication, Basic Authentication>>
* <<Config_Oauth2ClientCredentialsAuthentication, Oauth2 Client Credentials Authentication>>
 | The connection types to provide to this configuration. | | x
 | Encoding a| String |  Character encoding used in the messaging. |  |
| Connection timeout a| Number |  Connection timeout for the request |  30 |
| Connection Timeout Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Time unit to use in the Timeout configurations |  `SECONDS` |
| Encoding a| String |  Default character encoding to use in all the messages. If not specified, the default charset in the mule configuration will be used |  |
| Name a| String |  The identifier of this element used to reference it in other components |  | x
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before Mule considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the instance expires at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. Mule purges the instances as appropriate. |  |
|===

=== Connection Types

[[Config_BasicAuthentication]]
==== Basic Authentication

Basic authentication is the simplest way of enforcing access controls because it does not require cookies, session identifiers, or login pages. Instead, it uses standard fields in the HTTP header, removing the need for handshakes. This mechanism provides no confidentiality protection for the transmitted credentials. They are merely encoded with Base64 in transit, but not encrypted or hashed in any way.

====== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Service base URL a| String |  The base URL of the service on SAP S/4HANA to be accessed from the connector. |  | x
| Username a| String |  The account username with which to log in to SAP S/4HANA. |  | x
| Password a| String |  The account password with which to log in to SAP S/4HANA. |  | x
| Discovery Service Enabled a| Boolean |  Enables automatic service discovery |  true |
| Discovery Service Path a| String |  URL to use for automatic services discovery |  `/sap/bc/srt/wsil_ext` |
| Service directory a| String |  Common HTTP directory for all SAP services |   |
| Unlisted services a| Array of String |  List of services to add to the list of discovered services |  |
| Service discovery resolution timeout a| Number |  Connection timeout for service discovery |  `30` |
| Service Discovery Timeout Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Time unit to use in the Timeout configuration |  `SECONDS` |
| Default HTTP headers a| Object | Default HTTP headers to include in the message. |  |
| Default query parameters a| Object | Default query parameters to include in the request. |  |
| Proxy configuration a| <<ProxyConfiguration>> |  Proxy configuration for the connector. |  |
| TLS configuration a| <<Tls>> |  Defines a configuration for TLS, which can be used from both the client and server sides to secure communication for the Mule app. When using the HTTPS protocol, the HTTP communication is secured using TLS or SSL. If HTTPS is configured as the protocol then the user needs to configure at least the keystore in the `tls:context` child element of the `listener-config`. | HTTP |
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to `true`, deployment fails if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy. |  |
|===

[[Config_Oauth2ClientCredentialsAuthentication]]
==== OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Authentication

OAuth 2.0 authentication provides a secure way of authenticating against the resource using the provided client ID and client secret. Authentication is ensured using an access token generated by the resource. The generated token has a limited lifespan and is automatically refreshed by initiating a refresh dance, after the token expires.

====== Parameters

[[RepeatableInMemoryStream]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Stream

When streaming in this mode, Mule does not use the disk to buffer the contents. If you exceed the buffer size, the message fails.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | The amount of memory to allocate to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can fit into the specified buffer size, then the buffer is expanded according to the `bufferSizeIncrement` attribute, with an upper limit of what is specified for `maxInMemorySize`. |  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This is how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds the amount specified for its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer should not expand, and a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error is thrown when the buffer gets full. |  |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | This is the maximum amount of memory to use. If the specified maximum is exceeded, a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error is thrown. A value lower than or equal to zero means there is no limit on the buffer size. |  |

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which all these buffer size attributes are expressed |  |
|===

[[RepeatableFileStoreStream]]
=== Repeatable File Store Stream

File store repeatable streams require buffering. Mule keeps a portion of the stream contents in memory. If the stream contents are larger than the configured buffer size, Mule backs up the buffer’s content to disk and then clears the memory.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| In Memory Size a| Number | Defines the maximum memory that the stream should use to keep data in memory. If more than that is consumed, then the contents start to buffer on the disk. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which maxInMemorySize is expressed |  |
|===

[non-repeatable-stream]
=== Non-repeatable Stream

In some cases, you may want to disable the repeatable stream functionality and use non-repeatable streams, which can have less performance overhead, memory use, and cost.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Transactional Action a| Enumeration, one of:

** ALWAYS_JOIN
** JOIN_IF_POSSIBLE
** NOT_SUPPORTED |  The type of joining action that operations can take regarding transactions. |  `JOIN_IF_POSSIBLE` |
|===

[[RedeliveryPolicy]]
=== Redelivery Policy

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Redelivery Count a| Number | The maximum number of times a message can be redelivered and processed unsuccessfully before triggering process-failed-message |  |
| Message Digest Algorithm a| String | The secure hashing algorithm to use. If not set, the default is SHA-256. |  |
| Message Identifier a| <<RedeliveryPolicyMessageIdentifier>> | Defines which strategy is used to identify the messages. |  |
| Object Store a| ObjectStore | The object store where the redelivery counter for each message is going to be stored. |  |

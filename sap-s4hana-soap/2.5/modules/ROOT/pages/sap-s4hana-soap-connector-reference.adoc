= SAP S/4HANA SOAP Connector 2.5 Reference - Mule 4

Anypoint Connector for SAP S/4HANA SOAP provides full support for the SOAP APIs exposed by SAP S/4HANA ERP and, starting with 2.1.x, provides support also for SAP S/4HANA On-Premise ERP.

The main class of an extension is the entry point from which configurations, connection providers, operations, and sources are declared.

==== Connection Types

[[Config_BasicAuthentication]]
===== Basic Authentication

Basic authentication is the simplest way of enforcing access controls because it does not require cookies, session identifiers, or login pages. Instead, it uses standard fields in the HTTP header, removing the need for handshakes. This mechanism provides no confidentiality protection for the transmitted credentials. They are merely encoded with Base64 in transit, but not encrypted or hashed in any way.

====== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Service base URL a| String |  Base URL of the service on SAP S/4HANA to be accessed from the connector. |  | x
| Username a| String |  Account username with which to log in to SAP S/4HANA. |  | x
| Password a| String |  Account password with which to log in to SAP S/4HANA. |  | x
| Discovery Service Enabled a| Boolean |  Enables automatic service discovery. |  true |
| Discovery Service Path a| String |  URL to use for automatic services discovery. |  `/sap/bc/srt/wsil_ext` |
| Service directory a| String |  Common HTTP directory for all SAP services. |   |
| Unlisted services a| Array of String |  List of services to add to the list of discovered services. |  |
| Service discovery resolution timeout a| Number |  Connection timeout for service discovery. |  `30` |
| Service Discovery Timeout Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Time unit to use in the timeout configuration. |  `SECONDS` |
| Default HTTP headers a| Object | Default HTTP headers to include in the message. |  |
| Default query parameters a| Object | Default query parameters to include in the request. |  |
| Proxy configuration a| <<ProxyConfiguration>> |  Proxy configuration for the connector. |  |
| TLS configuration a| <<Tls>> |  Defines a configuration for TLS, which can be used from both the client and server sides to secure communication for the Mule app. When using the HTTPS protocol, the HTTP communication is secured using TLS or SSL. If HTTPS is configured as the protocol then the user needs to configure at least the keystore in the `tls:context` child element of the `listener-config`. | HTTP |
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to `true`, deployment fails if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy. |  |
|===

[[Config_CertificateAuthentication]]
===== Certificate Authentication

An X.509 certificate is a digital certificate based on the widely accepted International Telecommunications Union (ITU) X.509 standard, which defines the format of public key infrastructure (PKI) certificates. They are used to manage identity and security in internet communications and computer networking. X.509 authentication requires a discovery service configuration, a valid certificate, and a secure connection (HTTPS).

include::connectors::partial$oauth2-description.adoc[]

OAuth 2.0 authentication provides a secure way of authenticating against the resource using the provided client ID and client secret.

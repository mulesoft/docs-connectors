Microsoft SharePoint 2010 Connector v1.0

[NOTE]
As of October 2020, Microsoft stopped providing support for Sharepoint 2010. See https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sharepoint-blog/extended-support-for-sharepoint-server-2010-ends-in-october-2020/ba-p/272628#:~:text=Mainstream%20support%20for%20SharePoint%20Server,support%20for%20SharePoint%20Server%202010[this article] for more information. As a result, Anypoint Connector for Sharepoint 2010 is deprecated since the underlying technology does not have support from Microsoft.

MuleSoft continues to support the following Anypoint Connectors to assist you with your Sharepoint integration needs:

* Sharepoint Connector - Mule 4
* Sharepoint Online Connector - Mule 3
* Sharepoint 2013 Connector - Mule 3
* Sharepoint On-Premise Connector - Mule 3

Anypoint Connector for Microsoft SharePoint 2010 (SharePoint 2010 Connector) is a web app platform for content and document management, intranet portals, collaboration, extranets, websites, and enterprise search. The connector enables integration with SharePoint 2010 through its SOAP API.

== Authentication Schemes

The Microsoft SharePoint 2010 connector supports the following authentication schemes:

* NTLM Authentication
* Kerberos Authentication
* Claims-based Authentication

=== NTLM Authentication

image::sharepointntlmconfig.png[]

The NTLM Authentication scheme has the following parameters:

[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|Username |User to authenticate with.
|Password |Password for the user to authenticate with.
|Domain |Domain of the SharePoint instance.
|Site URL |The path to the Microsoft SharePoint Site (`+https://sharepoint.myorganization.com/site+`).
|Disable Cn Check |When dealing with HTTPS certificates, if the certificate is not signed by a trusted partner, the server might respond with an exception. To prevent this it is possible to disable the CN (Common Name) check. *Note:* This is not recommended for production environments.
|===

=== Kerberos Authentication

image::sharepointkerberosconfig.png[]

The Kerberos Authentication scheme has the following parameters:

[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|Username |User to authenticate with.
|Password |Password for the user to authenticate with.
|Domain |Domain of the SharePoint instance.
|Site URL |The path to the Microsoft SharePoint Site (`+https://sharepoint.myorganization.com/site+`).
|Disable Cn Check |When dealing with HTTPS certificates, if the certificate is not signed by a trusted partner, the server might respond with an Exception. To prevent this it is possible to disable the CN (Common Name) check. *Note:* This is not recommended for production environments.
|Service Principal Name (SPN) |The SPN looks like host/SERVER-NAME.MYREALM.COM
|Realm |The Domain that the user belongs to. Note that this value is case-sensitive and must be specified exactly as defined in Active Directory.
|KDC |This is usually the Domain Controller (server name or IP).
|===

==== Advanced Kerberos Configuration

If the environment is complex and requires further settings, a Kerberos configuration file has to be created manually and referenced in the connector’s connection configuration.

The following parameters are available for advanced scenarios:

* *Login Properties File Path*: Path to a customized Login Properties File. You can tune the Kerberos login module (Krb5LoginModule) with scenario-specific configurations by defining a JAAS login configuration file. When not specified, default values which usually work for most cases are set up. There are two options for setting this property:
** Place the file in the class path (usually under `src/main/resources`) and set the value of the property to `classpath:jaas.conf`.
** Provide the full path to the file as in `C:\kerberos\jaas.conf`.
* *Kerberos Properties File path*: Path to a customized Kerberos Properties File. There are two options for setting this property:
** Place the file in the class path (usually under `src/main/resources`) and set the value of the property to     `classpath:krb5.conf`.
** Provide the full path to the file as in `C:\kerberos\krb5.conf`.

==== JAAS Login Configuration File

Following is a sample of the JAAS login configuration file for the Kerberos login module:

----
Kerberos {
    com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
    debug=true
    refreshKrb5Config=true;
};
----

For more information on how to create the JAAS login configuration file for the Kerberos login module, see http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/jre/api/security/jaas/spec/com/sun/security/auth/module/Krb5LoginModule.html[Krb5LoginModule].

==== Kerberos Configuration File

Following is a sample of the content of a Kerberos configuration file:

`[libdefaults]default_realm = MYREALM.COM[realms]MYREALM.COM = { kdc = mydomaincontroller.myrealm.com default_domain = MYREALM.COM}[domain_realm].myrealm.com = MYREALM.COMmyrealm.com = MYREALM.COM`

*Important*: Realm and default_domain are case-sensitive and must be specified exactly as defined in Active Directory. Receiving an error during Test Connection stating "Message stream modified (41)" is an indication that the domain name is not correctly formed.

More information on how to create the Kerberos configuration file can be found at http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-devel/doc/admin/conf_files/krb5_conf.html[krb5_conf].

=== Claims-Based Authentication

image::sharepointclaimsconfig.png[]

The Claims-Based authentication scheme has the following parameters:

[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|Username |User to authenticate with.
|Password |Password for the user to authenticate with.
|Domain |Domain of the SharePoint instance.
|Site URL |The path to the Microsoft SharePoint site (`+https://sharepoint.myorganization.com/site+`).
|Security Token Service URL (STS URL) |The STS endpoint that accepts username and password for authenticating users and understands the WS-Trust 1.3 protocol. When the STS is Microsoft’s ADFS (Active Directory Federation Services), this URL usually is: `+https://youradfs.com/adfs/services/trust/13/usernamemixed+`
|Security Token Service (STS) App Identifier (Scope) |This string that identifies the SharePoint site in the STS. It is also known as *Relying Party Identifier*, *Client Identifier*, *Scope* or *Realm*. When the STS is Microsoft’s ADFS, this value can be discovered in the AD FS Management console under AD FS > Trust Relationships > Relying Party Trusts > (SharepoinP Site’s relying part properties) > Identifiers tab.
|Disable Cn Check |When dealing with HTTPS certificates, if the certificate is not signed by a trusted partner, the server might respond with an Exception. To prevent this it is possible to disable the CN (Common Name) check. *Note:* this is not recommended for production environments.
|===

*Note*: The  *Sts App Identifier*  can be obtained by logging into the SharePoint site that want to be accessed by opening the Site URL in a web browser. If there is more than one authentication provider configured for the site, a drop-down lists the options. Selecting the desired STS redirects to the STS’s login page. At this point, the address bar of the web browser contains a URL that includes the following query parameters `wa=wsignin1.0&wtrealm=uri%3amule%3asp80`. The parameter *wa*  tells the STS that a sign in is being initiated. The `wtrealm` contains the URL-encoded value STS App Identifier. In the example, `uri%3amule%3asp80`  is  `uri:mule:sp80`. The unencoded value is the parameter for the connector’s configuration.

== Security Token Authentication

You can use a SAML security token to log in to SharePoint. You can provide an XML body via a POST request to get the security token that you put in the Studio Security Token field.

To obtain a security token, make a POST request to `+https://login.microsoftonline.com/extSTS.srf+` with this XML body:

== Reference Objects

If you choose for a query to return either SharepointListReference or SharepointListMultiValueReference, the returned value of the field depends on the value of the *Retrieve full objects for reference fields* parameter:

* Not checked: A summary object containing the reference object’s ID and the reference object list’s ID:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
    "Title": "A title",
    "LookupField":
        {
            "id": "1",
            "lookupListName": "aaaa-1111-bbbb-2222"
        },
    "MultiValueLookupField":
        {
            "ids":
                [
                    "1",
                    "2",
                    "3"
                ],
            "lookupListName": "cccc-3333-dddd-4444"
        }
}
----
+
Resolve method:
+
Both summary objects, SharepointListReference or SharepointListMultiValueReference, make available a method called *resolve*.
+
After calling this method, the method returns the fully referenced object and replaces the summary object in the item with this resolved reference.
+
For example, calling the *resolve* method on the `LookupField` returns the item with ID "1" of the list with title "aaaa-1111-bbbb-2222" and the item contains:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
    "Title": "A title",
    "LookupField":
        {
            "ID": "1",
            "lookupListName": "aaaa-1111-bbbb-2222"
            "Title": "Another title",
            "Property": "A property",
            ...
        },
    "MultiValueLookupField":
        {
            "ids":
                [
                    "1",
                    "2",
                    "3"
                ],
            "lookupListName": "cccc-3333-dddd-4444"
        }
}
----
+
* Checked: The full object that the graph retrieves.
+
In case there is a cycle, the summary reference object is shown:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
"Title": "A title",
    "LookupFieldId":
        {
            "Title": "Another title",
            "Id": "1",
            Property1": "A value",
            ...
        },
    "MultiValueLookupFieldId":
        [
            {
                "Title": "Another title",
                "Id": "1",
                "Property1": "A value",
                ...
            },
            {
                "Title": "Another title",
                "Id": "2",
                "Property1": "A value",
                ...
            }
        ]
}
----
+
*Note*: Checking this option might cause large items with many reference fields to take a long time to retrieve.

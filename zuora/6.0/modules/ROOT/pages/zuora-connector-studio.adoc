= Using Anypoint Studio to Configure Zuora Connector 6.0 - Mule 4
:page-aliases: connectors::zuora/zuora-connector-studio.adoc

Anypoint Studio (Studio) editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.

To add and configure a connector in Studio:

. <<create-mule-project,Create a Mule project>>.
. <<add-connector-to-project,Add the connector to your Mule project>>.
. <<configure-input-source,Configure an input source for the connector's flow>>.
. <<add-connector-operation,Add a connector operation to the flow>>.
. <<configure-global-element,Configure a global element for the connector>>.

When you run the connector, you can view the app log to check for problems, as described in <<view-app-log,View the App Log>>.

If you are new to configuring connectors in Studio, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-config-use-studio.adoc[Using Anypoint Studio to Configure a Connector]. If, after reading this topic, you need additional information about the connector fields, see the xref:zuora-connector-reference.adoc[Zuora Connector Reference].

[[create-mule-project]]
== Create a Mule Project

In Studio, create a new Mule project in which to add and configure the connector: 

. In Studio, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
. Enter a name for your Mule project and click *Finish*.

[[add-connector-to-project]]
== Add the Connector to Your Mule Project

Add Zuora Connector to your Mule project to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location and add the required dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Modules to Project*, type `zuora` in the search field.
. Click *Zuora* in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.

[[configure-input-source]]
== Configure a Source

A source operation initiates a flow when a specified condition is met.
You can configure one of these input sources to use with Zuora Connector:

* *HTTP > Listener*, which initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port
* `Scheduler`, which initiates a flow when a time-based condition is met

For example, to configure an HTTP listener, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *HTTP > Listener*.
. Drag *Listener* to the Studio canvas.
. On the *Listener* configuration screen, optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. Specify a value for the *Path* field.
. Click the plus sign (+) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of the HTTP listener in the app.
. On the *General* tab, specify the connection information for the connector.
. On the *TLS* tab, optionally specify the TLS information for the connector.
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

[[add-connector-operation]]
== Add a Connector Operation to the Flow

When you add a connector operation to your flow, you immediately define a specific operation for that connector to perform.

To add an operation for Zuora Connector, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *Zuora* and then select the desired operation.
. Drag the operation onto the Studio canvas to the right of the input source.

[[configure-global-element]]
== Configure a Global Element for the Connector

When you configure a connector, it’s best to configure a global element that all instances of that connector in the app can use. Configuring a global element requires you to provide the authentication credentials the connector uses to access the target Zuora system. 

To configure the global element for Zuora Connector, follow these steps:

. Select the name of the connector in the Studio canvas.
. In the configuration screen for the operation, click the plus sign (+) next to the *Connector configuration* field to access the global element configuration fields.
. On the *General* tab, enter the following required values to configure authentication for:
* <<basic-auth,*Basic Auth Connection Type*>>
* <<oauth-authentication,*OAuth2 Connection Provider*>>
+
You can reference a configuration file that contains ANT-style property placeholders (recommended), or you can enter your authorization credentials in the global configuration properties. For information about the benefits of using property placeholders and how to configure them, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-connector-configuration-overview.adoc[Anypoint Connector Configuration].
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

[[basic-auth]]
=== Basic Authentication

Enter the following information on the *General* tab of the *Global Element Properties* screen to configure Basic authentication:

* *Username* +
Zuora username
* *Password* +
Zuora password
* *Base Uri* +
Base path of the Zuora REST API for your instance, for example: 
`https://apisandbox-api.zuora.com:443/`.

The following screenshot shows an example of configuring Basic authentication:

image::zuora-5-basic-auth-studio.png["Global element properties window for Basic authentication"]

[[oauth-authentication]]
=== OAuth 2.0

include::connectors::partial$oauth2-description.adoc[]

Enter the following information on the *General* tab of the *Global Element Properties* screen to configure OAuth 2.0 authentication:

* *Client id* +
ID of the client
* *Client secret* +
Client secret used to authenticate the client.
* *Token URL* +
Service provider's accessToken endpoint URL, for example: `+https://rest.apisandbox.zuora.com/oauth/token+`
* *Scopes* +
A comma-separated list of supported OAuth scopes to request during the OAuth dance. If not provided, it defaults to the OAuth scopes in the annotation


[[view-app-log]]
== View the App Log

To check for problems, you can view the app log as follows:

* If you’re running the app from Anypoint Platform, the output is visible in the Anypoint Studio console window.
* If you’re running the app using Mule from the command line, the app log is visible in your OS console.

Unless the log file path is customized in the app’s log file (`log4j2.xml`), you can also view the app log in the default location `MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`.


== Next Step

After configuring an app in Studio, see the xref:zuora-connector-examples.adoc[Zuora Examples] section to experiment with the Zuora connector.

== Upgrade Prerequisites

Before you perform the upgrade, you must:

. Create a backup of your files, data, and configuration in case you need to restore to the previous version. 
. Install Zuora Connector to replace the Zuora operations that were previously included in Zuora Connector 5.x.x.

== Upgrade Steps

Follow these steps to perform the upgrade to Zuora Connector 6.0.0:

.. In Studio, create a Mule project.
.. In the Mule Palette view, click *Search in Exchange*.
.. In Add Modules to Project, type 'Zuora' in the search field.
.. In Available modules, select *Zuora Connector*, and then click *Add*.
.. Click *Finish*.
.. Verify that the `zuora-connector` dependency version is `6.0.0` in the `pom.xml`.

Anypoint Studio upgrades the connector automatically. 


== Verify the Upgrade

After you install the latest version of the connector, follow these steps to verify the upgrade:

. In Anypoint Studio, verify that there are no errors in the *Problems* or *Console* views. +
* If you’re running the app from Anypoint Platform, the output is visible in the Anypoint Studio console window.
* If you’re running the app using Mule from the command line, the app log is visible in your OS console.
+
Unless the log file path is customized in the app’s log file (`log4j2.xml`), you can also view the app log in the default location `MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`.
. Check the project `pom.xml` and verify that there are no problems.
. Test the connection and verify that the operations work.  

== Troubleshooting

If there are problems with caching the parameters and caching the metadata, try restarting Anypoint Studio.  

== Reverting the Upgrade

If it is necessary to revert to the previous version of Zuora Connector, change the `zuora-connector` dependency version `6.0.0` in the project's `pom.xml` to the previous version.  

You must update the project's `pom.xml` in Anypoint Studio.

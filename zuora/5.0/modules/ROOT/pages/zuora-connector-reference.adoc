[[CreateEventsEventTriggers]]
== POST Event Trigger
`<mule-zuora-connector:create-events-event-triggers>`

You can define an event trigger on any of the following objects:

* Account
* AccountingCode
* AccountingPeriod
* Amendment
* BillingRun
* Contact
* CreditBalanceAdjustment
* CreditMemo
* CreditMemoApplication
* CreditMemoApplicationItem
* CreditMemoItem
* DebitMemo
* DebitMemoItem
* Feature
* Invoice
* InvoiceAdjustment
* InvoiceItem
* InvoiceItemAdjustment
* JournalEntry
* JournalEntryItem
* Order
* OrderAction
* Payment
* PaymentApplication
* PaymentMethod
* PaymentPart
* Product
* ProductFeature
* ProductRatePlan
* ProductRatePlanCharge
* RatePlan
* RatePlanCharge
* Refund
* RefundApplication
* RevenueEvent
* RevenueEventItem
* RevenueSchedule
* RevenueScheduleItem
* Subscription
* SubscriptionProductFeature
* TaxationItem
* Usage

The `baseObject` field specifies the object on which to define a trigger. The `condition` field is a http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/[JEXL] expression that specifies when to trigger events. The expression can contain fields from the object that the trigger is defined on.

The condition cannot contain fields from https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/M_Export_ZOQL[data source] objects that are joined to the object that the trigger is defined on. For example, the following condition causes an event to be triggered whenever an invoice is posted with an amount greater than 1000:

`changeType == 'UPDATE' &amp;&amp; Invoice.Status == 'Posted' &amp;&amp; Invoice.Status_old != 'Posted' &amp;&amp; Invoice.Amount &gt; 1000`

Where:

* `changeType` is a keyword that specifies the type of change that occurred to the Invoice object. For all objects, the supported values of `changeType` are `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.
* `Invoice.Status` is the value of the Invoice object's `Status` field after the change occurred.
* `Invoice.Status_old` is the value of the Invoice object's `Status` field before the change occurred. In the above example, the value of `baseObject` would be `Invoice`. +
The number of the event triggers that you can create depends on the https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/C_Zuora_Editions[edition of Zuora Central Platform] you are using. This operation makes an HTTP POST request to the `/events/event-triggers` endpoint.


=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]

[[CreateV1ActionAmend]]
== Amend
`<mule-zuora-connector:create-v1-action-amend>`


This operation modifies a subscription by creating Amendment objects. However, to modify a subscription, Zuora recommends that you use [Update subscription](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/PUT_Subscription) instead of this operation.

You cannot use this operation to update multiple subscriptions.

You can use this operation to create up to 10 Amendment objects.

You must specify the following fields for each Amendment object:

* `ContractEffectiveDate`
* `Name`
* `SubscriptionId` +
The value of `SubscriptionId` must be the same for each Amendment object.
* `Type`

When you call this operation, Zuora modifies the subscription in the order that you specify Amendment objects in the request body. If Zuora is unable to create an Amendment object when you call this operation, the entire call fails.

This operation makes an HTTP POST request to the `/v1/action/amend` endpoint.

[[CreateV1ActionCreate]]
== Create
`<mule-zuora-connector:create-v1-action-create>`


Use the create call to create one or more objects of a specific type.

You can specify different types in different create calls, but each create call must apply to only one type of object.

=== Limitations

This call has the following limitations:

* A maximum of 50 objects are supported in a single call.
* The Invoice Settlement feature is not supported. This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement.
* The default WSDL version for Actions is 79. To create objects according to a different WSDL version, set the `X-Zuora-WSDL-Version` header. +
To find out in which WSDL version a particular object or field was introduced, see [Zuora SOAP API Version History](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/G_SOAP_API/Zuora_SOAP_API_Version_History).

=== How to Use this Call

You can call create on an array of one or more zObjects. It returns an array of SaveResults, indicating the success or failure of creating each object. The following information applies to this call:

* Cannot pass in null zObjects
* Can pass in a maximum of 50 zObjects at a time
* All objects must be of the same type

=== Using Create and Subscribe Calls

Both the create and subscribe calls will create a new account. However, there are differences between the calls. Use the create call to create an account independent of a subscription. Use the subscribe call to create the account with the subscription and the initial payment information.

This operation makes an HTTP POST request to the `/v1/action/create` endpoint.

[[CreateV1ActionExecute]]
== Execute
`<mule-zuora-connector:create-v1-action-execute>`


Use the execute call to execute a process to split an invoice into multiple invoices. The original invoice must be in draft status. The resulting invoices are called split invoices.

[NOTE]
This feature is in **Limited Availability**. If you want access to the feature, submit a request to http://support.zuora.com[Zuora Global Support].

To split a draft invoice into multiple split invoices:

. Use the create call to create a separate InvoiceSplitItem object for each split invoice that you want to create from the original draft invoice.
. Use the create call to create a single InvoiceSplit object to collect all of the InvoiceSplitItem objects.
. Use the execute call to split the draft invoice into multiple split invoices.

You need to create InvoiceSplitItem objects and an InvoiceSplit object before you can use the execute call. +
Supported objects:

* InvoiceSplit
* Asynchronous process

This operation makes an HTTP POST request to the `/v1/action/execute` endpoint.

[[CreateV1ActionQuery]]
== Query
`<mule-zuora-connector:create-v1-action-query>`

The query call sends a query expression by specifying the object to query, the fields to retrieve from that object, and any filters to determine whether a given object should be queried.

You can use [Zuora Object Query Language](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/K_Zuora_Object_Query_Language) (ZOQL) to construct those queries, passing them through the `queryString`. Once the call is made, the API executes the query against the specified object and returns a query response object to your application. Your application can then iterate through rows in the query response to retrieve information.

This operation makes an HTTP POST request to the `/v1/action/query` endpoint.

=== Limitations

This call has the following limitations:

* All ZOQL keywords must be in lower case.
* The number of records returned is limited to 2000 records
* The Invoice Settlement feature is not supported. This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement.
* The default WSDL version for Actions is 79. To query objects or fields according to a different WSDL version, set the `X-Zuora-WSDL-Version` header. To find out in which WSDL version a particular object or field was introduced, see [Zuora SOAP API Version History](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/G_SOAP_API/Zuora_SOAP_API_Version_History).

[[CreateV1ActionQueryMore]]
== Query More
`<mule-zuora-connector:create-v1-action-query-more>`


Use `queryMore` to request additional results from a previous query call. If your initial query call returns more than 2000 results, you can use `queryMore` to query for the additional results. Any `queryLocator` results greater than 2,000 are stored by Zuora for only 5 days before the results are deleted.

If the initial query call returns more than 2000 results, you can use the `queryLocator` returned from the query to request the next set of results.

**Note:** Zuora expires `queryMore` cursors after 15 minutes of activity. To use `queryMore`, you must first construct a query call. By default, the query call returns up to 2000 results. If there are more than 2000 results, the query returns a boolean `done`, which will be marked as `false`, and a `queryLocator`, which is a marker you will pass to `queryMore` to get the next set of results.

This operation makes an HTTP POST request to the `/v1/action/queryMore` endpoint.

[[CreateV1ActionSubscribe]]
== Subscribe
`<mule-zuora-connector:create-v1-action-subscribe>`


This call performs many actions. Use the subscribe call to bundle information required to create at least one new subscription. The call takes in an array of SubscribeRequests. Because it takes an array, you can submit a batch of subscription requests at once.

You can create up to 50 different subscriptions in a single subscribe call.

This is a combined call that you can use to perform all of the following tasks in a single call:

* Create accounts
* Create contacts
* Create payment methods, including external payment options
* Create an invoice for the subscription
* Apply the first payment to a subscription

===  Object Limits

50 objects are supported in a single call.

=== Effective Date

If the effective date is in the future, the invoices will not be generated, and there will be no invoice number.

=== Subscription Name and Number

The subscription name is a unique identifier for the subscription. If you do not specify a value for the name, Zuora creates one automatically. The automatically generated value is known as the subscription number, such as `A-S00000080`.

You cannot change the subscription name or number after creating the subscription.

* **Subscription name**: The name that you set for the subscription.
* **Subscription number**: The value generated by Zuora automatically if you do not specify a subscription name. Both the subscription name and number must be unique. If they are not, an error will occur.

=== Subscription ID

The subscription ID is a 32-digit ID in the format 4028xxxx. This is also the unique identifier for a subscription. This value is automatically generated by the system and cannot be edited or updated, but it can be queried. One subscription can have only one subscription name or number, but it can have multiple IDs: Each version of a subscription has a different ID.

The Subscription object contains the fields `OriginalId` and `PreviousSubscriptionId`. `OriginalId` is the ID for the first version of a subscription. `PreviousSubscriptionId` is the ID of the version created immediately prior to the current version.

=== Subscription Preview

You can preview invoices that would be generated by the subscribe call.

=== Invoice Subscriptions Separately

If you have enabled the invoice subscriptions separately feature, a subscribe call will generate an invoice for each subscription for every subscription where the field `IsInvoiceSeparate` is set to `true`.

If the invoice subscriptions separately feature is disabled, a subscribe call will generate a single invoice for all subscriptions. See [Invoicing Subscriptions Separately](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Subscriptions/B_Creating_Subscriptions/Invoicing_Subscriptions_Separately) for more information.

=== Subscriptions and Draft Invoices

If a draft invoice that includes charges exists in a customer account, using the subscribe call to create a new subscription and generate an invoice will cause the new subscription to be added to the existing draft invoice. Zuora will then post the invoice.

=== When to Use Subscribe and Create Calls

You can use either the subscribe call or the create call to create the objects associated with a subscription (accounts, contacts, and so on). There are differences between these calls, however, and some situations are better for one or the other.

=== Use the Subscribe Call

The subscribe call bundles up all the information you need for a subscription. Use the subscribe call to create new subscriptions when you have all the information you need. Subscribe calls cannot update BillTo, SoldTo, and Account objects.

Payment information objects cannot be updated if there is an existing account ID in the call. These objects are not supported in a subscribe call.

=== Use the Create Call

The create call is more useful when you want to develop in stages. For example, if you want to first create an account, then a contact, and so on. If you do not have all information available, use the create call. To create a subscription, you must activate the account from Draft status to Active by calling the subscribe call.

This operation makes an HTTP POST request to the `/v1/action/subscribe` endpoint.

[[CreateV1ActionUpdate]]
== Update
`<mule-zuora-connector:create-v1-action-update>`


Updates the information in one or more objects of the same type.

You can specify different types of objects in different update calls, but each specific update call must apply to only one type of object.

You can update an array of one or more zObjects. It returns an array of SaveResults, indicating the success or failure of updating each object.

The following information applies to this call:

* You cannot pass in null zObjects.
* You can pass in a maximum of 50 zObjects at a time.
* All objects must be of the same type.
* For each field in each object, you must determine that object's ID. Then populate the fields that you want update with the new information.
* Zuora ignores unrecognized fields in update calls. +
For example, if an optional field is spelled incorrectly or a field that does not exist is specified, Zuora ignores the field and continues to process the call. No error message is returned for unrecognized fields.

=== Limitations

This call has the following limitations:

* A maximum of 50 objects are supported in a single call.
* The Invoice Settlement feature is not supported. This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement.
* The default WSDL version for Actions is 79. To update objects or fields according to a different WSDL version, set the `X-Zuora-WSDL-Version` header. To find out in which WSDL version a particular object or field was introduced, see [Zuora SOAP API Version History](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/G_SOAP_API/Zuora_SOAP_API_Version_History).

This operation makes an HTTP POST request to the `/v1/action/update` endpoint.

[[CreateV1BillingPreviewRuns]]
== Create Billing Preview Run
`<mule-zuora-connector:create-v1-billing-preview-runs>`


**Note:** This feature is in **Limited Availability**. If you wish to have access to the feature, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](http://support.zuora.com/). Creates billing preview runs for multiple customer accounts.

You can run up to 10 billing previews in batches concurrently. A single batch of customer accounts can only have one billing preview run at a time. So you can have up to 10 batches running at the same time. If you create a billing preview run for all customer batches, you cannot create another billing preview run until this preview run is completed.

This operation makes an HTTP POST request to the /v1/billing-preview-runs endpoint.


=== Parameters

[[CreateV1Connections]]
== Establish connection to Zuora REST API service
`<mule-zuora-connector:create-v1-connections>`


Establishes a connection to the Zuora REST API service based on a valid user credentials. **Note:**This is a legacy REST API. Zuora recommends you to use [OAuth](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#section/Authentication/OAuth-v2.0) for authentication instead. This call authenticates the user and returns an API session cookie that's used to authorize subsequent calls to the REST API. The credentials must belong to a user account that has permission to access the API service. As noted elsewhere, it's strongly recommended that an account used for Zuora API activity is never used to log into the Zuora UI. Once an account is used to log into the UI, it may be subject to periodic forced password changes, which may eventually lead to authentication failures when using the API.

This operation makes an HTTP POST request to the /v1/connections endpoint

Generates and posts invoices and credit memos and collects payments for posted invoices. Credit memos are only available if you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled and negative charges exist. Credit memos will not be applied to invoices.

If draft invoices and credit memos exist when you run this operation, this operation will post the invoices and credit memos. Note that draft credit memos created from an invoice or a product rate plan charge will not be posted.

You can use this operation to generate invoices and collect payments on the posted invoices, or else simply collect payment on a specified existing invoice. The customer's default payment method is used, and the full amount due is collected. The operation depends on the parameters you specify.

* To generate one or more new invoices for that customer and collect payment on the generated and other unpaid invoice(s), leave the **invoiceId** field empty.
* To collect payment on an existing invoice, specify the invoice ID. The operation is atomic; if any part is unsuccessful, the entire operation is rolled back. When an error occurs, gateway reason codes and error messages are returned the error response of this operation.

The following items are some gateway response code examples:
* Orbital: `05 Do Not Honor`; `14 Invalid Credit Card Number`
* Vantiv: `301 Invalid Account Number`; `304 Lost/Stolen Card`
* CyberSource2: `202 Expired card`; `231 Invalid account number`

For more reason code information, see the corresponding payment gateway documentation.

[NOTE]
Timeouts may occur when using this method on an account that has an extremely high number of subscriptions.

This operation makes an HTTP POST request to the `/v1/operations/invoice-collect` endpoint.

[[CreateV1Orders]]
== Create order
`<mule-zuora-connector:create-v1-orders>`


**Note:** This operation is only available if you have the [Orders](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AA_Overview_of_Orders#Orders) feature enabled. The migration to Orders is in **Limited Availability**. We are actively soliciting feedback from a small set of early adopters before releasing as generally available.

You can use this operation to create subscriptions and make changes to subscriptions by creating orders. The following tutorials demonstrate how to use this operation:

* [Add a Product to a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/A_Add_a_Product_to_a_Subscription)
* [Create a Ramp Deal](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/A_Create_a_Ramp_Deal)
* [Create a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/A_Create_a_Subscription)
* [Change the Owner of a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/C_Change_the_Owner_of_a_Subscription)
* [Change the Terms and Conditions of a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/C_Change_the_Terms_and_Conditions_of_a_Subscription)
* [Renew a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/C_Renew_a_Subscription)
* [Renew a Subscription and Upgrade a Product](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/C_Renew_a_Subscription_and_Upgrade_a_Product)
* [Replace a Product in a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/C_Replace_a_Product_in_a_Subscription)
* [Update a Product in a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/C_Update_a_Product_in_a_Subscription)
* [Cancel a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/D_Cancel_a_Subscription)
* [Remove a Product from a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/D_Remove_a_Product_from_a_Subscription) Creating a draft order is currently not supported. See [Known Limitations in Orders](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/C_Known_Limitations_in_Orders) for additional limitations.

**Note:** When you are to suspend a subcription (via the `suspend` order action), if in the same "Create order" call you are to perform other subsequent order actions on the supscription to suspend, you must first resume the subscription (via a `resume` order action). **Note:** When using this operation to create an account, create a subscription, run billing, and collect payment in a single call, if the payment processing fails then all the other steps will be rolled back. This means that the invoice will not be generated, the subscription will not be created, and the account will not be created. **Note:** Zuora has the following limits on Orders to prevent performance degradation.

You can request a limit increase by submitting a request at [ZuoraÂ&nbsp;Global Support](https://support.zuora.com). * Up to 50 subscriptions are allowed in a single "Create order" operation call. * Up to 50 order actions are allowed in a single "Create order" operation call. * Up to 50 order actions are allowed on a single subscription in a "Create order" operation call. This operation makes an HTTP POST request to the /v1/orders endpoint

[[CreateV1Usage]]
== Post usage
`<mule-zuora-connector:create-v1-usage>`


This REST API reference describes how to post or import usage data for one or more accounts in the CSV format. There are no path or query parameters. The data is uploaded using the HTTP multipart/form-data POST method and applied to the user's tenant.

=== How this REST API Call Works

The content of the uploaded usage file must follow the format used by the UI import tool. It must be a comma-separated (CSV) file with a corresponding .csv extension. The length of the file name must not exceed 50 characters. The file size must not exceed 4MB. See [Downloading the Usage Template](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/J_Billing_Operations/Usage/C_Import_Usage_Data#Downloading_the_Usage_Template) to learn about how to download the usage file template.

When the upload completes, before the file contents are actually being processed, the API returns a response containing the byte count of the received file and a URL for checking the status of the import process. Of the five possible results displayed at that URL (Pending, Processing, Completed, Canceled, and Failed) only a Completed status indicates that the import was successful. The operation is atomic; if any record fails, the file is rejected. In that case, the entire import is rolled back and all stored data is returned to its original state. To view the actual import status, enter the resulting status URL from the checkImportStatus response using a tool such as POSTMAN. This additional step provides more information about why the import has failed. To manage the information after a successful upload, use the web-based UI. ## Usage File Format The usage file uses the following headings:

|===
| Heading | Description | Required
| ACCOUNT_ID | Enter the account number, e.g., the default account number, such as A00000001, or your custom account number. Although this field is labeled as Account_Id, it is not the actual Account ID nor Account Name. | Yes |
| UOM | Enter the unit of measure. This must match the UOM for the usage. | Yes | | QTY | Enter the quantity. | Yes |
| STARTDATE | Enter the start date of the usage. This date determines the invoice item service period the associated usage is billed to. Date format is based on locale of the current user. Default date format: `MM/DD/YYYY`. | Yes |
| ENDDATE | Enter the end date of the usage. This is not used in calculations for usage billing and is optional. Date format is based on locale of the current user. Default date format: `MM/DD/YYYY`. **Note:** The value of this column is optional, but the column header is required. | No | | SUBSCRIPTION_ID | Enter the subscription number or subscription name. If you created the subscription in the Zuora application, Zuora created a number automatically in a format similar to A-S00000001. If you do not provide a value for this field, the associated usage will be added to all subscriptions for the specified Account that use this Unit Of Measure. If your Accounts can have multiple subscriptions and you do not want double or triple counting of usage, you must specify the Subscription or Charge ID in each usage record. **Note:** The value of this column is optional, but the column header is required. | No |
| CHARGE_ID a| Enter the charge number (not the charge name).

You can see the charge ID, for example, C-00000001, when you add your rate plan to your subscription and view your individual charges. If your Accounts can have multiple subscriptions and you do not want double or triple counting of usage, you must specify the specific Subscription or Charge ID in each usage record. This field is related to the Charge Number on the subscription rate plan. **Note:** The value of this column is optional, but the column header is required. | No |
| DESCRIPTION | Enter a description for the charge. | No |

If you wish to have access to the feature, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](http://support.zuora.com/). Retrieves the information about all items of a credit memo. A credit memo item is a single line item in a credit memo.

=== Filtering

You can use query parameters to restrict the data returned in the response. Each query parameter corresponds to one field in the response body. If the value of a filterable field is string, you can set the corresponding query parameter to `null` when filtering. Then, you can get the response data with this field value being `null`.

Examples:

* /v1/creditmemos/402890245c7ca371015c7cb40ac30015/items?amount=100
* /v1/creditmemos/402890245c7ca371015c7cb40ac30015/items?amount=100&amp;sort=createdDate

This operation makes an HTTP GET request to the /v1/creditmemos/{creditMemoId}/items endpoint.


=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Configuration | String | The name of the configuration to use. | | x
| Credit Memo Id a| String |  The unique ID of a credit memo. For example, 8a8082e65b27f6c3015ba45ff82c7172. |  | x
| Service End Date a| String |  This parameter filters the response based on the `serviceEndDate` field. |  |
| Created By Id a| String |  This parameter filters the response based on the `createdById` field. |  |
| sku a| String |  This parameter filters the response based on the `sku` field. |  |
| Sku Name a| String |  This parameter filters the response based on the `skuName` field. |  |
| Source Item Id a| String |  This parameter filters the response based on the `sourceItemId` field. |  |
| Service Start Date a| String |  This parameter filters the response based on the `serviceStartDate` field. |  |
| Subscription Id a| String |  This parameter filters the response based on the `subscriptionId` field. |  |
| Applied Amount a| Number |  This parameter filters the response based on the `appliedAmount` field. |  |
| amount a| Number |  This parameter filters the response based on the `amount` field. |  |
| id a| String |  This parameter filters the response based on the `id` field. |  |
| Page Size a| Number |  Number of rows returned per page. |  20 |
| Refund Amount a| Number |  This parameter filters the response based on the `refundAmount` field. |  |

| sort a| String a|  This parameter restricts the order of the data returned in the response.

You can use this parameter to supply a dimension you want to sort on. A sortable field uses the following form: *operator* *field_name*

You can use at most two sortable fields in one URL path. Use a comma to separate sortable fields. For example: *operator* *field_name*, *operator* *field_name* *operator* is used to mark the order of sequencing. The operator is optional. If you only specify the sortable field without any operator, the response data is sorted in descending order by this field. - The `-` operator indicates an ascending order. - The `+` operator indicates a descending order. By default, the response data is displayed in descending order by updated date. *field_name* indicates the name of a sortable field. The supported sortable fields of this operation are as below: - amount - appliedAmount - createdById - createdDate - id - refundAmount - serviceEndDate - serviceStartDate - sku - skuName - sourceItemId - subscriptionId - updatedById - updatedDate Examples: - /v1/creditmemos/402890245c7ca371015c7cb40ac30015/items?sort=createdDate - /v1/creditmemos/402890245c7ca371015c7cb40ac30015/items?amount=100&amp;sort=createdDate |  |

You can use this parameter to supply a dimension you want to sort on. A sortable field uses the following form: *operator* *field_name*

You can use at most two sortable fields in one URL path. Use a comma to separate sortable fields. For example: *operator* *field_name*, *operator* *field_name* *operator* is used to mark the order of sequencing. The operator is optional. If you only specify the sortable field without any operator, the response data is sorted in descending order by this field. - The `-` operator indicates an ascending order. - The `+` operator indicates a descending order. By default, the response data is displayed in descending order by updated date. *field_name* indicates the name of a sortable field. The supported sortable fields of this operation are as below: - id - amount - beAppliedAmount - sku - skuName - serviceStartDate - serviceEndDate - sourceItemId - createdDate - createdById - updatedDate - updatedById - subscriptionId Examples: - /v1/debitmemos/402890245c7ca371015c7cb40b28001f/items?sort=createdDate - /v1/debitmemos/402890245c7ca371015c7cb40b28001f/items?amount=100&amp;sort=createdDate |  |

[[GetV1DescribeByObject]]
== Describe Object
`<mule-zuora-connector:get-v1-describe-by-object>`


Provides a reference listing of each object that is available in your Zuora tenant. The information returned by this call is useful if you are using [CRUD: Create Export](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/Object_POSTExport) or the [AQuA API](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/T_Aggregate_Query_API) to create a data source export. See [Export ZOQL](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/M_Export_ZOQL) for more information.

=== Response

The response contains an XML document that lists the fields of the specified object. Each of the object's fields is represented by an element in the XML document. Each field element contains the following elements:

|===
|Element |Description
| `<name>`
| API name of the field.
| `<label>`
| Name of the field in the Zuora user interface.
| `<type>`
| Data type of the field. The possible data types are: `boolean`, `date`, `datetime`, `decimal`, `integer`, `picklist`, `text`, `timestamp`, and `ZOQL`. If the data type is `picklist`, the `<field>` element contains an `<options>` element that lists the possible values of the field.
| `<contexts>`
| Specifies the availability of the field. If the `<contexts>` element lists the `export` context, the field is available for use in data source exports.
|===
The `<field>` element contains other elements that provide legacy information about the field. This information is not directly related to the REST API.

Response sample:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<object>
  <name>ProductRatePlanCharge</name>
  <label>Product Rate Plan Charge</label>
  <fields>
    ...
    <field>
      <name>TaxMode</name>
      <label>Tax Mode</label>
      <type>picklist</type>
      <options>
        <option>TaxExclusive</option>
        <option>TaxInclusive</option>
      </options>
      <contexts>
        <context>export</context>
      </contexts>
      ...
    </field>
    ...
  </fields>
</object>
----

It is strongly recommended that your integration checks `<contexts>` elements in the response. If your integration does not check `<contexts>` elements, your integration may process fields that are not available for use in data source exports. See https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/M_Export_ZOQL/Changes_to_the_Describe_API[Changes to the Describe API] for more information.

This operation makes an HTTP GET request to the /v1/describe/{object} endpoint.

[[GetV1InvoicesAmountBreakdownByOrderByInvoiceNumber]]
== Get breakdown of Invoice by Order
`<mule-zuora-connector:get-v1-invoices-amount-breakdown-by-order-by-invoice-number>`


**Note:** This feature is in Limited Availability. Retrieves a specified invoice that is broken down by orders. One invoice item might be broken down into a list of order related items.

=== Phantom Invoice Item

Phantom invoice items are generated via this API operation if an invoice item has a credit back scenario and the action you are making is prior to the end of a previous action. Phantom invoice items are not real invoice items and have no impact to billing. They are generated in parallel with the real invoice item and are used to properly allocate invoice items to the relevant orders. They share the same invoice item id with the real invoice item but with a prefix of "Phantom-". Also, the amount of a phantom invoice item is always zero.

Below is an example phantom invoice item, which reflects in the period of 2017-10-01 to 2017-12-31:

* Order 1 creates the initial subscription with an invoice breakdown amount of "3000".
* Order 2 decreases the product quantity and so reduces the amount by "1500".
* Order 3 cancels the subscription and so reduces the remaining amount by "1500".

== Get Payment Runs
`<mule-zuora-connector:get-v1-payment-runs>`


Retrieves the information about all payment runs.

You can define filterable fields to restrict the data returned in the response.

=== Filtering

You can use query parameters to restrict the data returned in the response. Each query parameter corresponds to one field in the response body. If the value of a filterable field is string, you can set the corresponding query parameter to `null` when filtering. Then, you can get the response data with this field value being `null`.

Examples:

* /v1/payment-runs?status=Processed
* /v1/payment-runs?targetDate=2017-10-10&amp;status=Pending
* /v1/payment-runs?status=Completed&amp;sort=+updatedDate

This operation makes an HTTP GET request to the /v1/payment-runs endpoint.

** Canceled |  This parameter filters the response based on the `status` field. |  |
| Updated By Id a| String |  This parameter filters the response based on the `updatedById` field. |  |
| sort a| String a|  This parameter restricts the order of the data returned in the response.

 You can use this parameter to supply a dimension you want to sort on. A sortable field uses the following form: *operator* *field_name*

 You can use at most two sortable fields in one URL path. Use a comma to separate sortable fields. For example: *operator* *field_name*, *operator* *field_name* *operator* is used to mark the order of sequencing. The operator is optional. If you only specify the sortable field without any operator, the response data is sorted in descending order by this field. - The `-` operator indicates an ascending order. - The `+` operator indicates a descending order. By default, the response data is displayed in descending order by payment run number. *field_name* indicates the name of a sortable field. The supported sortable fields of this operation are as below: - targetDate - status - createdDate - createdById - updatedDate - updatedById Examples: - /v1/payment-runs?sort=+createdDate - /v1/payment-runs?status=Processing&amp;sort=-createdById,+targetDate |  |

[[GetV1Payments]]
== Get all payments
`<mule-zuora-connector:get-v1-payments>`


**Note:** The Invoice Settlement feature is in **Limited Availability**. This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you wish to have access to the feature, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](http://support.zuora.com/). Retrieves the information about all payments from all your customer accounts.

=== Filtering

You can use query parameters to restrict the data returned in the response. Each query parameter corresponds to one field in the response body. If the value of a filterable field is string, you can set the corresponding query parameter to `null` when filtering. Then, you can get the response data with this field value being `null`.

Examples:

* /v1/payments?status=Processed
* /v1/payments?currency=USD&amp;status=Processed
* /v1/payments?status=Processed&amp;type=External&amp;sort=+number

This operation makes an HTTP GET request to the /v1/payments endpoint.


=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]

| sort a| String a| This parameter restricts the order of the data returned in the response.

You can use this parameter to supply a dimension you want to sort on. A sortable field uses the following form: *operator* *field_name*

You can use at most two sortable fields in one URL path. Use a comma to separate sortable fields. For example: *operator* *field_name*, *operator* *field_name* *operator* is used to mark the order of sequencing. The operator is optional. If you only specify the sortable field without any operator, the response data is sorted in descending order by this field. - The `-` operator indicates an ascending order. - The `+` operator indicates a descending order. By default, the response data is displayed in descending order by payment number. *field_name* indicates the name of a sortable field. The supported sortable fields of this operation are as below: - number - accountId - amount - appliedAmount - unappliedAmount - refundAmount - creditBalanceAmount - effectiveDate - createdDate - createdById - updatedDate - updatedById Examples: - /v1/payments?sort=+number - /v1/payments?status=Processed&amp;sort=-number,+amount |  |

[[GetV1Refunds]]
== Get all refunds
`<mule-zuora-connector:get-v1-refunds>`


**Note:** This feature is only available if you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is in **Limited Availability**. If you wish to have access to the feature, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](http://support.zuora.com/). Retrieves the information about all refunds. Two types of refunds are available, electronic refunds and external refunds.

=== Filtering

You can use query parameters to restrict the data returned in the response. Each query parameter corresponds to one field in the response body. If the value of a filterable field is string, you can set the corresponding query parameter to `null` when filtering. Then, you can get the response data with this field value being `null`.

Examples:

* /v1/refunds?status=Processed
* /v1/refunds?amount=4&amp;status=Processed
* /v1/refunds?status=Processed&amp;type=External&amp;sort=+number

This operation makes an HTTP GET request to the /v1/refunds endpoint.

You can use this parameter to supply a dimension you want to sort on. A sortable field uses the following form: *operator* *field_name*

You can use at most two sortable fields in one URL path. Use a comma to separate sortable fields. For example: *operator* *field_name*, *operator* *field_name* *operator* is used to mark the order of sequencing. The operator is optional. If you only specify the sortable field without any operator, the response data is sorted in descending order by this field. - The `-` operator indicates an ascending order. - The `+` operator indicates a descending order. By default, the response data is displayed in descending order by refund number. *field_name* indicates the name of a sortable field. The supported sortable fields of this operation are as below: - number - accountId - amount - refundDate - paymentId - createdDate - createdById - updatedDate - updatedById Examples: - /v1/refunds?sort=+number - /v1/refunds?status=Processed&amp;sort=-number,+amount |  |

[[UpdateV1AccountingPeriodsPendingCloseByApId]]
== Set accounting period to pending close
`<mule-zuora-connector:update-v1-accounting-periods-pending-close-by-ap-id>`


Sets an accounting period to pending close. This operation makes an HTTP PUT request to the /v1/accounting-periods/{ap-id}/pending-close endpoint

=== Before You Begin

* You must have Zuora Finance enabled on your tenant.
* You must have the Manage Close Process and Run Trial Balance user permissions.

=== Limitations

* The accounting period cannot be closed or pending close.
* The accounting period cannot be in the process of running a trial balance.
* All earlier accounting periods must be closed.

=== Notes

When you set an accounting period to pending close in Zuora, a trial balance is automatically run for that period. A response of `{ "success": true }` means only that the accounting period status is now pending close, but does not mean that the trial balance has successfully completed.

You can use the Get Accounting Period REST API call to view details about the outcome of the trial balance.

[[UpdateV1AccountsByAccountKey]]
== Update account
`<mule-zuora-connector:update-v1-accounts-by-account-key>`


Updates a customer account by specifying the account-key.

=== Notes

. Only the fields to be changed should be specified. Any field that is not included in the request body will not be changed.
. If an empty field is submitted with this operation, the corresponding field in the account is emptied.
. Email addresses: If no email addresses are specified, no change is made to the email addresses on file or to the email delivery preference. If either the **personalEmail** or **workEmail** is specified (or both), the system updates the corresponding email address(es) on file and the email delivery preference is set to `true`. (In that case, emails go to the **workEmail** address, if it exists, or else the **personalEmail**.) +
On the other hand, if as a result of this call both of the email addresses for the account are empty, the email delivery preference is set to `false`.
. The bill-to and sold-to contacts are separate data entities; updating either one does not update the other. This operation makes an HTTP PUT request to the /v1/accounts/{account-key} endpoint

[[UpdateV1BulkStopByBulkKey]]
== Stop Mass Action
`<mule-zuora-connector:update-v1-bulk-stop-by-bulk-key>`

This reference describes how to stop a mass action through the REST API.

You can stop a mass action when its status is Pending or Processing. After you have stopped a mass action, you can get the mass action result to see details of the mass action.

* If you stop a mass action when its status is Pending, no response file is generated because no records have been processed.
* If you stop a mass action when its status is Processing, a response file is generated.

You can check the response file to see which records have been processed and which have not. In the response file, the **Success** column has the value `Y` (successful) or `N` (failed) for processed records, and a blank value for unprocessed records. Records that have already been processed when a mass action is stopped are not rolled back.

This operation makes an HTTP PUT request to the /v1/bulk/{bulk-key}/stop endpoint


=== Parameters

[[UpdateV1JournalRunsCancelByJrNumber]]
== Cancel journal run
`<mule-zuora-connector:update-v1-journal-runs-cancel-by-jr-number>`


This reference describes how to cancel a journal run using the REST API. The summary journal entries in the journal run are canceled asynchronously. See the "Example" section below for details.

You must have the "Cancel Journal Run" Zuora Finance user permission enabled to cancel journal runs.

=== Notes

When you cancel a journal run, the summary journal entries associated with that journal run are canceled asynchronously. A response of `{ "success": true }` means only that the specified journal run has a status of "Pending", "Error", or "Completed" and therefore can be canceled, but does not mean that the whole journal run was successfully canceled. For example, let's say you want to cancel journal run JR-00000075. The journal run status is "Completed" and it contains ten journal entries. One of the journal entries has its Transferred to Accounting status set to "Yes", meaning that the entry cannot be canceled. The workflow might go as follows:

. Make an API call to cancel the journal run.
. The journal run status is "Completed", so you receive a response of `{ "success": true }`.
. Zuora begins asynchronously canceling journal entries associated with the journal run. The journal entry whose Transferred to Accounting status is "Yes" fails to be canceled. The cancelation process continues, and the other journal entries are successfully canceled.
. The journal run status remains as "Completed". The status does not change to "Canceled" because the journal run still contains a journey entry that is not canceled.

This operation makes an HTTP PUT request to the /v1/journal-runs/{jr-number}/cancel endpoint


=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Configuration | String | The name of the configuration to use. | | x

[[UpdateV1ObjectBillRunById]]
== CRUD: Post or Cancel bill run
`<mule-zuora-connector:update-v1-object-bill-run-by-id>`


**Note:** This feature is in **Limited Availability**. If you wish to have access to the feature, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](http://support.zuora.com). ## Post a Bill Run Posting a bill run is an asynchronous operation. To post a bill run, the current bill run must have a status of `Completed`. When a bill run is posted, its status is changed to `PostInProgress`. Once all invoices for this bill run are posted then its status is changed to `Posted`. When you post a bill run and query the status of a bill run, you will get one of the following results `PostInProgress`, `Completed`, or `Posted`. If all invoices in the bill run are posted, then the status of the bill run is `Posted`. If one or more invoices fail to post, the status will change back to `Completed` and you will need to post the bill run again. ## Cancel a Bill Run Canceling a bill run is an asynchronous operation. When canceling a bill run, the logic is the same as when using the UI to cancel a bill run.

You must provide the `BillRunId`, and set the Status to `Canceled`. When canceling a bill run, consider the following: * Canceling a bill run with a `Completed` status. * Only the current bill run will be canceled. * Canceling a bill run with a `Pending` status. * When canceling an Ad-hoc bill run, only the current bill run will be canceled. * When canceling a scheduled bill, all scheduled bill runs will be canceled. The Cancel operation may not be successful. Its success depends on its current business validation. Only a bill run that has no posted invoices can be canceled. If any posted invoices belong to the bill run then an invalid value exception will be thrown with the message, "The Bill Run cannot be Cancelled, There are Posted invoices."

This operation makes an HTTP PUT request to the /v1/object/bill-run/{id} endpoint

[[UpdateV1SubscriptionsBySubscriptionKey]]
== Update Subscription
`<mule-zuora-connector:update-v1-subscriptions-by-subscription-key>`


Use this call to make the following kinds of changes to a subscription:

* Add a note
* Change the renewal term or auto-renewal flag
* Change the term length or change between evergreen and termed
* Add a new product rate plan * Remove an existing subscription rate plan
* Change the quantity or price of an existing subscription rate plan

=== Notes

* The Update Subscription call creates a new subscription, which has the old subscription number but a new subscription ID. The old subscription is canceled but remains in the system.
* In one request, this call can make: * Up to 9 combined add, update, and remove changes
* No more than 1 change to terms &amp; conditions
* Updates are performed in the following sequence:
. First change the notes on the existing subscription, if requested.
. Then change the terms and conditions, if requested.
. Then perform the remaining amendments based upon the effective dates specified. If multiple amendments have the same contract-effective dates, then execute adds before updates, and updates before removes.
* The update operation is atomic. If any of the updates fails, the entire operation is rolled back.
* The response of the Update Subscription call is based on the REST API minor version you set in the request header. The response structure might be different if you use different minor version numbers.
* If you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled, we recommend that you set the `zuora-version` parameter to `207.0` or later. Otherwise, an error is returned.

=== Override a Tiered Price

There are two ways you override a tiered price:

* Override a specific tier number, for example: `tiers[{tier:1,price:8},{tier:2,price:6}]`
* Override the entire tier structure, for example:
+
----
tiers[{tier:1,price:8,startingUnit:1,endingUnit:100,priceFormat:"FlatFee"}, {tier:2,price:6,startingUnit:101,priceFormat:"FlatFee"}]
----

If you just override a specific tier, do not include the `startingUnit` field in the request.

This operation makes an HTTP PUT request to the /v1/subscriptions/{subscription-key} endpoint

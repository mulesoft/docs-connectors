= To Run the Cassandra Connector Demo
:page-aliases: 3.8@mule-runtime::cassandra-connector-run-demo-task.adoc

You can use this demo to do the following things:

* Create a new keyspace and use the keyspace for other operations.
* Drop a keyspace and delete its data.
* Create a table in a specified keyspace or the keyspace you configured in the connection parameters.
* Drop a table from the keyspace.
* Get the names of tables from a keyspace.
* Alter table operations: Add New Column, Remove Column, Rename Column, Change Column Type
* Insert rows into the DEMO table.
* Select all in the DEMO table.
* Update the name or event column values in the DEMO table given the row Id.
* Delete rows from the DEMO table given the row Id.
* Delete values from the name and event columns of the DEMO table given row Ids.
* Execute any valid CQL query, including parameters, such as `SELECT * FROM DEMO WHERE id IN (?,?)`.

. Install and start Apache Cassandra.
. Create a keyspace if you don't already have one. For example, create a keyspace named Excelsior.
. Install the Cassandra Connector in Studio and start Studio.
. Download the Cassandra Connector demo, demo.zip, from the Download section of this topic.
. Expand the downloaded file. In Studio, click Import > Anypoint Studio Project From External Location. Browse to and select `/demo`. Import the directory.
. Update the Apache Cassandra connection parameters in `/src/main/app/mule-app.properties`, using the pre-existing keyspace. For example:
+
----
username=cassandra
password=cassandra
host=localhost
keyspace=Excelsior
port=9042
----
+
. Save all.
. In CassandraDBDemo > Global Elements, select CassandraDB: Username/Password Connection, and click Edit.
. Click Test Connection, and assuming the connection succeeds, run the app.
+
The following keyspace and table are created transparently in the Cassandra database:
+
----
CREATE KEYSPACE demo_keyspace WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': '3'}  AND durable_writes = true;

CREATE TABLE demo_keyspace.demo_table (
    id int PRIMARY KEY,
    event text,
    name text
);
----

Go to `+http://localhost:8081/+` and use the demo form to test drive the Cassandra connector.

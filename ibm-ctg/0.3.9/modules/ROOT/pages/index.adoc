== Before You Begin

To use this information, you should be familiar with Mule runtime engine (Mule), Anypoint Connectors, Anypoint Studio essentials, elements in a Mule flow, and global elements.

=== Terminology

* CICS (Customer Information Control System): Set of enterprise application servers with support for high-transaction workloads in a secure, scalable, cost efficient environment. CICS applications are written in a variety of languages, from Java to COBOL.
* CICS Region: Named collection of resources that are controlled by CICS as a unit. A CICS resource is any facility or component of a CICS system that is required to perform a task.
* CICS TG (CICS Transaction Gateway): Set of client and server software components that allow a remote client application to invoke services in a CICS region. The client application can be either a Java application or a non-Java application. The CICS TG is available through the following two products: CICS TG on z/OS and  CICS TG for Multiplatforms
* COMMAREA: block of contiguous memory used to pass data between programs. It is the binary equivalent of a COBOL structure and it is character-based.
* ECI (External Call Interface): Simple remote procedural call style interface, used for linking to CICS applications. The COMMAREA or channel is the data interface used for the exchange of data between the client application and the CICS.
* JCA: Standard architecture for connecting the J2EE platform to heterogeneous Enterprise Information Systems (EIS), such as CICS. The JCA enables an EIS vendor to provide a standard resource adapter for its EIS. A resource adapter is the middle tier between a Java application and an EIS and connects the Java application to the EIS.

[[install]]
== Install the Connector

. In Anypoint Studio, click the *(X)* Exchange icon in the Studio taskbar.
. In Anypoint Exchange, click *Login*
. In Exchange, search for this connector, select the connector's card, and click *Install*.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

[[ns-schema]]
== Connector Namespace and Schema

In Anypoint Studio, when you drag the connector from the palette onto the Anypoint Studio canvas, Studio automatically populates the XML code with the connector namespace and schema location.

*Namespace:* `+http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ibm-ctg+` +
*Schema Location:* `+http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/connector/current/mule-ibm-ctg.xsd+`

If you are manually coding the Mule application in Studio's XML editor or another text editor, define the namespace and schema location in the header of your Configuration XML, inside the `<mule>` tag.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<mule xmlns="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xmlns:ibm-ctg="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ibm-ctg"
      xsi:schemaLocation="

[[configure]]
== Configure the Connector

Place the connector in your flow as applicable for your use case.

To use the IBM CTG connector in your Mule application, configure a global IBM CTG Configuration element that can be used by the connector.

The IBM CTG connector provides the following global configuration:

[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|Host | Enter the host name of the CICS TG.
|Port | Enter the port on which the CICS TG is running. Default value is 2006.
|Server Name |Enter the name of the target CICS server as defined in the CICS TG configuration file. Optional.
|Username |Enter the CICS user ID. Optional, if security is NOT enabled in the CICS region.
|Password |Enter the password for the CICS user ID. Optional, if security is NOT enabled in the CICS region.
|Keystore Location |Enter the location of the keystore containing the certificates required for an SSL connection. Optional.
|Keystore Password |Enter the password required to access the keystore for an SSL connection. Optional.
|Connection Timeout |Enter the socket timeout for the connection to CTG. Default value is 0 (no timeout).
|Response Timeout |Enter the response timeout value for a connection to CTG. This timeout represents the maximum amount of time in milliseconds that a managed connection attempts to wait for a response for a request. A value of 0 represents no timeout. Default value is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds). *&#8224;*
|CTG Trace |If checked, all debug levels of CTG tracing are turned on. Default value is false.
|Required Dependencies |

* ccf2.jar (CICS Common Connector Framework)
* cicsjee.jar (CICS JEE)
* ctgclient.jar (CTG Client Library)
* ctgserver.jar (CTG Server Library)
* geronimo-j2ee-connector_1.6_spec-1.0.jar

*Note:* Use the JAR files that come bundled with the installation of the CTG server instead of downloading the SDK ZIP from IBM's website to ensure the compatibility between the connector and the CTG system.
|===

*&#8224;* *Response Timeout* is overridden by the `ecitimeout` parameter if configured on the server side.
See https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSZHFX_9.0.0/com.ibm.cics.tg.doc/ctgunx/ipictimeout.html[IBM ECI Timeout].

[[use-case-5]]
=== Use Case 5: Add Custom Metadata

The IBM CTG connector does not provide dynamic or static metadata out-of-the-box, but allows users to define custom types using the Metadata Type tool. Follow the below guide to define input and output metadata:

. Place a schema file under `src/main/resources` directory, normally in `.ffd` format.
+
These schema files must be supplied by the user. They can be obtained from COBOL copybooks, which are included in the CICS installation.
+
. Go to the Metadata tab of the connector operation and click the Add metadata button.
 Select `Input:Payload` and click the Edit icon to open de Metadata Editor.
+
image::ibm-ctg-use-case-4-1.png[]
. Click Add to create a new type and provide and ID for it (that is, `ec01-in-type` for the program `EC01` input data).
. Select type Copybook, then Schema and provide the location of the schema file.
. This populates a drop-down with a list of available data segments. Choose the one you need and click the Select button to save the configuration.
+
image::ibm-ctg-use-case-4-2.png[]
. Drag a DataWeave transformer before the IBM CTG component. Metadata fields will become available to build the mapping.
+
image::ibm-ctg-use-case-4-3.png[]

Metadata definition is not a required step to use the IBM CTG connector but it is essential to improve the usability of the connector.  Refer to xref:6.x@studio::defining-metadata.adoc[Defining Metadata] for additional information.

[[use-case-6]]
=== Use Case 6: Load Java Metadata

Inside DataWeave, click Define Metadata to open the Metadata window.

. Click Add and provide the an ID, such as CommareaRequest.
. Select type Java, then Java object in the Data Structure table.
. Search the class CommareaRequest (or the fully qualified name `org.mule.modules.ibmctg.internal.model.CommareaRequest`) and click OK.
+
image::ibm-ctg-use-case-5.png[]
+
. Click *Select* to save the configuration.
. Perform the same steps to load metadata for the `ChannelRequest` type.

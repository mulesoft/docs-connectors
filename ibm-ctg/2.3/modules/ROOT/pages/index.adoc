IBM CICS Transaction Gateway Connector Version 2.3

Anypoint Connector for IBM CICS Transaction Gateway (IBM CTG Connector) provides integration with back-end CICS apps using the CICS Transaction Gateway. For Java platforms, CTG implements the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) resource adapter to connect Java applications to the Customer Information Control System (CICS) system. The connector serves as a link between Mule apps and the IBM CTG.

Exchange: https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange/com.mulesoft.connectors/mule-ibm-ctg-connector/[IBM CICS Transaction Gateway Connector]

== Prerequisites

To use this information, you must be familiar with IBM CTG, Mule runtime engine (Mule), Anypoint Connectors, Anypoint Studio, Mule concepts, elements in a Mule flow, and Global Elements.

You need login credentials to test your connection to your target resource.

To use this connector with Apache Maven, view the pom.xml file dependency information from
the *Dependency Snippets* link in https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange/com.mulesoft.connectors/mule-ibm-ctg-connector/[Anypoint Exchange].

== Terminology

CICS (Customer Information Control System)::
Set of enterprise application servers with support for high-transaction workloads in a secure, scalable, cost efficient environment. CICS applications are written in a variety of languages, from Java to COBOL.

CICS Region::
Named collection of resources that are controlled by CICS as a unit. A CICS resource is any facility or component of a CICS system that is required to perform a task.

CICS TG (CICS Transaction Gateway)::
Set of client and server software components that allow a remote client application to invoke services in a CICS region. The client application can be either a Java application or a non-Java application. The CICS TG is available through the following two products: CICS TG on z/OS and CICS TG for Multiplatforms.

COMMAREA::
Block of contiguous memory used to pass data between programs. It is the binary equivalent of a COBOL structure and it is character-based.

ECI (External Call Interface)::
Simple remote procedural call style interface, used for linking to CICS applications. The COMMAREA or channel is the data interface used for the exchange of data between the client application and the CICS.

JCA::
Standard architecture for connecting the J2EE platform to heterogeneous Enterprise Information Systems (EIS), such as CICS. The JCA enables an EIS vendor to provide a standard resource adapter for its EIS. A resource adapter is the middle tier between a Java application and an EIS and connects the Java application to the EIS.

[[connect-in-design-center]]
== Connect in Design Center

Design Center enables you to create apps visually. To use Design Center, work with your Anypoint Platform administrator to ensure that you have a xref:access-management::environments.adoc#to-create-a-new-environment[Design environment]. For more information, see the xref:design-center::fd-tour.adoc[Flow Designer Tour].

To create an app in Design Center:

* Configure the input source (trigger) for your app.
* Add the connector as a component to process the input for the app.

For information about Design Center field values, see the xref:connectors::ibm/ibm-ctg-connector-reference.adoc[Connector Reference].

== Configure the Trigger

. In Design Center, click *Create*.
. Click *Create new application*.
. Specify a value for *Project name* and click *Create*.
. Click a trigger to be the input source, such as HTTP Listener or Scheduler trigger.
+
The IBM CTG Connector does not provide a trigger operation.

  <groupId>com.mulesoft.connectors</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-ibm-ctg-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
</dependency>
----

Replace `x.x.x` with the version that corresponds to the connector you are using.

To obtain the most up-to-date `pom.xml` file information, access the connector in https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Anypoint Exchange] and click *Dependency Snippets*.

== Enable Logging for Requests and Responses

To enable logging of the interactions of the connector with IBM CTG, a logger must be configured in the log4j2.xml file of the Mule app as follows. Put the AsyncLogger statement in the `Loggers` block in the log4j2.xml file:

[source,xml,linenums]

	name="org.mule.modules.ibmctg.internal.service.CTGServiceImpl"
	level="DEBUG"/>
----

== Common Use Cases

* Invoke a COMMAREA program
* Invoke a channel program
* Invoke a COMMAREA or channel program inside a Transactional Scope
* Add custom metadata

NOTE: To successfully run the first three use cases, the target CICS system must have the specified programs.

=== Invoke a COMMAREA Program

}
----

[[addcustommetadata]]
=== Add Custom Metadata

The IBM CTG Connector does not provide dynamic or static metadata out of the box, but it enables users to define custom types using the Metadata Type tool. Define input and output metadata as follows:

. Place a schema file under `src/main/resources` directory, normally in `.ffd` format.
+
Note: These schema files must be supplied by the user. They can be obtained from COBOL copybooks, which are included in the CICS installation.
+
. Go to the Metadata tab of the connector operation and click *Add metadata*.
* Select Input:Payload and click *Edit* to open the Metadata Editor:
+
image::ibm-ctg-add-metadata.png[Metadata Editor]
+
. Click *Add* to create a new type and provide and ID for it, that is, ec03-in-type for the program EC03 input data.
. Select type Copybook, select Schema, and provide the location of the schema file.
. From the list of available data segments drop-down menu that appears, choose the one you need and click *Select* to save the configuration.
. Drag a DataWeave transformer in front of the IBM CTG component in the flow.
+
Metadata fields become available to build the mapping.
+
image::ibm-ctg-transform-metadata.png[Metadata fields]
+
Having a metadata definition is not required to use IBM CTG Connector, but it is essential to improve the usability of the connector. See xref:studio::create-metadata-class-task.adoc[Create Metadata].

[[loadjavametadata]]
==== Load Java Metadata

In DataWeave, click *Define Metadata* to open the Metadata window.

. Click *Add* and provide an ID, such as `CommareaRequest`.
. Select type Java and then select a Java object in the Data Structure table.
. Search the class CommareaRequest or the fully qualified name `org.mule.modules.ibmctg.internal.model.CommareaRequest`, and click *OK*.
. Click *Select* to save the configuration.
. Perform the same steps to load metadata for the ChannelRequest type.

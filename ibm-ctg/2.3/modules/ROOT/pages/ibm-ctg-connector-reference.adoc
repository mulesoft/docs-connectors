[[executeWithMultipleChannels]]
=== Execute With Multiple Channels
`<ibmctg:execute-with-multiple-channels>`


Calls a remote CICS program sending data encapsulated in channels and containers, allowing users to transfer more than 32 KB in a single request.

A container is a named reference to a storage area managed by CICS that can hold any form of application data. A container can hold data in any format that the application requires and is limited only by the amount of storage available. An application can reference any number of containers.

A channel is a uniquely named reference to a collection of containers. It is analogous to a COMMAREA, but it is not subject to its constraints. Programs can pass a single channel between them. You can think of a channel as a parameter list. The same channel can be passed from one program to another.

Channels and containers are visible only to the program that creates them, and to the programs that they are passed to. When these programs end, CICS automatically deletes the containers and their storage. They are not recoverable. If you require to use recoverable containers, use CICS BTS containers.

=== Reconnection

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required

| Reconnection Strategy a| * <<reconnect>>
* <<reconnect-forever>> | The reconnection strategy to use. |  |
|===

[[reconnect]]
=== Reconnect

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Frequency a| Number | How often in milliseconds to reconnect. | |
| Count a| Number | How many reconnection attempts to make. | |
| blocking |Boolean |If false, the reconnection strategy runs in a separate, non-blocking thread. |true |
|===

[[reconnect-forever]]
=== Reconnect Forever

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Frequency a| Number | How often in milliseconds to reconnect. | |
| blocking |Boolean |If false, the reconnection strategy runs in a separate, non-blocking thread. |true |
|===

[[PoolingProfile]]
=== Pooling Profile

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Active a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can be borrowed from a session at one time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of components that may be active at one time. When maxActive is exceeded, the pool is said to be exhausted. |  |
| Max Idle a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can sit idle in the pool at any time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of Mule components that may be idle at one time. |  |
| Max Wait a| Number | Specifies the number of milliseconds to wait for a pooled component to become available when the pool is exhausted and the exhaustedAction is set to WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT. |  |
| Min Eviction Millis a| Number | Determines the minimum amount of time an object may sit idle in the pool before it is eligible for eviction. When non-positive, no objects will be evicted from the pool due to idle time alone. |  |
| Eviction Check Interval Millis a| Number | Specifies the number of milliseconds between runs of the object evictor. When non-positive, no object evictor is executed. |  |
| Exhausted Action a| Enumeration, one of:

** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW
** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT
** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL | Specifies the behavior of the Mule component pool when the pool is exhausted. Possible values are: "WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL", which will throw a NoSuchElementException, "WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT", which will block by invoking Object.wait(long) until a new or idle object is available, or WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW, which will create a new Mule instance and return it, essentially making maxActive meaningless. If a positive maxWait value is supplied, it will block for at most that many milliseconds, after which a NoSuchElementException will be thrown. If maxThreadWait is a negative value, it will block indefinitely. |  |
| Initialisation Policy a| Enumeration, one of:

** INITIALISE_NONE
** INITIALISE_ONE
** INITIALISE_ALL | Determines how components in a pool should be initialized. The possible values are: INITIALISE_NONE (will not load any components into the pool on startup), INITIALISE_ONE (will load one initial component into the pool on startup), or INITIALISE_ALL (will load all components in the pool on startup) |  |
| Disabled a| Boolean | Whether pooling should be disabled |  |
|===

[[ExpirationPolicy]]
=== Expiration Policy

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Idle Time a| Number | A scalar time value for the maximum amount of time a dynamic configuration instance should be allowed to be idle before it's considered eligible for expiration |  |

** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS | A time unit that qualifies the maxIdleTime attribute |  |

| Response Container a| String | The name of the container used to return the data obtained from the CICS program. Value is case-sensitive. |  | x
| Error Container a| String | The name of the container used to return error information if something goes wrong in the CICS program. Value is case-sensitive. |  | x
| Program Name a| String | The name of the CICS program to call. It is case-sensitive. |  | x
| Tpn Name a| String | The transaction identifier of the CICS mirror transaction. Optional. |  |
| Encoding a| String | The data encoding. Default value is IBM037. | IBM037 |
|===

[[repeatable-in-memory-stream]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Stream

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | The amount of memory that will be allocated to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can be fit into this buffer, then the buffer expands according to the bufferSizeIncrement attribute, with an upper limit of maxInMemorySize. |  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This is by how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer should not expand, meaning that a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised when the buffer gets full. |  |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | The maximum amount of memory to use. If more than that is used then a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised. A value lower than or equal to zero means no limit. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which all these attributes are expressed |  |
|===

[[repeatable-file-store-stream]]

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max In Memory Size a| Number | Defines the maximum memory that the stream should use to keep data in memory. If more than that is consumed then it will start to buffer the content on disk. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which maxInMemorySize is expressed |  |
|===

[[CommareaRequest]]
=== Commarea Request

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Commarea Length a| Number | The length of COMMAREA. Default value is -1. This should be set to less than or equal to the length of the byte array passed in the payload. The maximum advised size is
 32500 bytes, as this is guaranteed to be flowed successfully across all protocols. COMMAREA sizes greater than this may generate an ECI_ERR_INVALID_DATA_LENGTH return code. | -1 |
| Reply Length a| Number | The length of the data stream to be returned back from the Gateway daemon to the Mule (JCA) application. Default value is -1. Setting this property can reduce the data
 transmitted over the network if the data returned by CICS is less than the full COMMAREA size, and you know the size of the data in advance. | -1 |
| Program Name a| String | The name of the CICS program to call. It is case-sensitive. |  | x
| Tpn Name a| String | The transaction identifier of the CICS mirror transaction. Optional. |  |
| Encoding a| String | The data encoding. Default value is IBM037. | IBM037 |

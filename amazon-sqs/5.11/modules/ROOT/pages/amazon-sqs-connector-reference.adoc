Anypoint Connector for Amazon SQS (Amazon SQS Connector) enables you to interface with the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) API and manage SQS queueing services without having to interact with the Amazon SQS API directly.


[[config]]
== Configuration

Default Configuration for Amazon SQS Connector.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | Name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x
| Connection a| * <<config_basic, Basic>>
* <<config_role, Role>>
| Connection types for this configuration. | | x
| Default Global Queue URL a| String a|  This value is used when you do not set the queue URL at the operation level. If you do not specify the queue URL here or at the operation level, an exception is thrown.

A queue URL is constructed in the following format: `+https://sqs.{REGION}.amazonaws.com/{ACCOUNT_NUMBER}/{QUEUE_NAME}+`, for example: `+https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456789101/test-queue+`. |  |
| Default Wait Time | Number a| Default value for the maximum duration of a single poll, in seconds:

* Set this field to a value between `1` and `20` to use long polling. With long polling, if there are messages available immediately, the connector returns the query results immediately. If not, the connector waits up to the specified amount of seconds for a message to be added before returning an empty response.
+
* Set this field to `0` to use short polling. With short polling, the connector always returns the query results as soon as possible, even if that means returning an empty response. | `20` |
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before Mule considers it eligible for expiration. |  |

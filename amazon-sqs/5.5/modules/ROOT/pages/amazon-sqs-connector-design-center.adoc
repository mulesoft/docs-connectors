:page-aliases: connectors::amazon/amazon-sqs-connector-design-center.adoc

The Flow Designer feature of Anypoint Design Center enables you to create apps visually. To use Flow Designer, work with your Anypoint Platform administrator to ensure that you have a xref:access-management::environments.adoc#to-create-a-new-environment[Design environment]. For more information, see the
xref:design-center::fd-tour.adoc[Flow Designer Tour].

To create an app in Flow Designer:

* Configure the input source (trigger) for your app.
* Configure the target component for your app.

For information about Flow Designer field values, see
the xref:amazon-sqs-connector-reference.adoc[Amazon SQS Connector Reference].

== Configure the Input Source Trigger

. In Design Center, click *Create*.
. Click *Create new application* to open Flow Designer.
. Specify a value for *Project name* and click *Create*.
. Click *Go straight to canvas* to exit from *Let's get started*.
. Click on the trigger card.
. Search for the connector.
. Select the connector name.
. Select the *Receive messages* operation to use it as a source.
+
Alternatively, you can also use the HTTP Connector or Scheduler component as a source.
+
. Click *Click here to set it up*.
. If you selected the *Retrive messages* operation as a source, enter values for these fields:
+
[%header,cols="30s,70a",width=80%]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|*Configuration Name* |Name used to reference the configuration
|*Connection* | Connection type (`Basic` or `Role`)
|*Access Key* |Alphanumeric text string that uniquely identifies the user who owns the account
|*Secret Key* |Key that acts as a password
|*Role Arn* | For the `Role` connection type, the Amazon resource name of the role used to get account access
|===
+
. Click *Test* to confirm that the parameters of your global configuration are accurate, and that Mule is able to successfully connect to your instance of Amazon SQS.
. Click off the trigger card.
+
Flow Designer automatically saves all changes.

**NOTE**

**Receive Messages** source has **Primary node only** parameter placed in the Advanced tab. The default value of this parameter is set to false, what ensures that this source can be deployed on multiple nodes when running in cluster mode. When the application is designed to receive messages on primary node only, change this value to true by checking the **Primary node only** checkbox.

== Configure the Target Component

. Click *+* next to the trigger card.
. In *Select a component*, search for the connector name.
. Select the connector name.
. Select an operation for the connector, such as *Get Queue Attributes*.
. If needed, specify values that are required in the *General* tab.
+
For the *Get Queue Attributes* operation, enter the Amazon SQS queue URL in the *Queue URL* field.
+
. Select *Edit* to set up other required fields.
+
For the *Get Queue Attributes* operation, the required fields are as follows (if they do not already have values):
+
[%header,cols="30s,70a",width=80%]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|*Connection* | Connection type (`Basic` or `Role`)
|*Access Key* |Alphanumeric text string that uniquely identifies the user who owns the account
|*Secret Key* |Key that plays the role of a password
|===

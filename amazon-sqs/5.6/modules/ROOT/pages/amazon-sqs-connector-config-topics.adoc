== Creating the FIFO Queue

To create the FIFO queue, use the *Create queue* operation in the connector, and set the *FifoQueue* and *ContentBasedDeduplication* field values to true.

End the *queue name* value with the `.fifo` extension: for example, `MyTestFIFOQueue.fifo`.

While creating the FIFO queues, choose either of the two regions that Amazon supports:

* US_EAST_2 (US East Ohio)
* US_WEST_2 (US West Oregon)

When using Amazon SQS Connector to send messages to the FIFO queue, use the same queue URL and region name that you used when creating the FIFO queue. You must also provide a value for the attribute `message group id` in the connector configuration while sending messages.

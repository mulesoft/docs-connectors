= Amazon SQS Connector 5.10 Reference - Mule 4
:page-aliases: connectors::amazon/amazon-sqs-connector-reference.adoc

Anypoint Connector for Amazon SQS (Amazon SQS Connector) enables you to interface with the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) API and manage SQS queueing services without having to interact with the Amazon SQS API directly.


== Configurations
---
[[config]]
=== Default Configuration

==== Parameters
[%header,cols="20s,20a,35a,20a,5a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x
| Connection a| * <<config_basic, Basic>>
* <<config_role, Role>>
 | The connection types to provide to this configuration. | | x
| Default Global Queue URL a| String |  This value is used when you do not set the queue URL at the operation level. If you do not specify the queue URL here, or at the operation level, the exception is thrown. A queue URL is constructed in the following format:  `+https://sqs.{REGION}.amazonaws.com/{ACCOUNT_NUMBER}/{QUEUE_NAME}+`, for example: `+https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456789101/test-queue+` |  |
| Default Wait Time | Number a| Default value for the maximum duration of a single poll, in seconds:

* Set this field to a value between `1` and `20` to use long polling. With long polling, if there are messages available immediately, the connector returns the query results immediately. If not, the connector waits up to the specified amount of seconds for a message to be added before returning an empty response.
+
* Set this field to `0` to use short polling. With short polling, the connector always returns the query results as soon as possible, even if that means returning an empty response. | 20 |
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before Mule considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the instance expires at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. Mule purges the instances as appropriate. |  |
|===

=== Connection Types
[[config_basic]]
==== Basic

The Basic authentication method uses a session token provided by Amazon STS to connect to Amazon SQS.

====== Parameters
[%header,cols="20s,20a,35a,20a,5a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Session Token a| String |  The session token provided by Amazon STS. |  |
| Test Queue ARN a| String |  This parameter is used to test the connection to SQS Connector. If you do not specify this parameter, the test connection is not performed. A queue ARN is constructed in the following format: `arn:aws:{REGION}:{ACCOUNT_NUMBER}:{QUEUE_NAME}`, for example: `arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:123456789101:test-queue` |  |
| Large Payload Support a| <<LargePayloadSupport>> |  |  |
| Connection Timeout a| Number |  The amount of time to wait (in milliseconds) when initially establishing a connection before the connector gives up and times out. A value of 0 means infinity and is not recommended. |  50000 |
| Max Connections a| Number |  Sets the maximum number of allowed open HTTP connections. |  |
| Socket Timeout a| Number |  The amount of time to wait (in milliseconds) for data to be transferred over an established, open connection before the connection times out. A value of 0 means infinity and is not recommended. |  50000 |

| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to `true`, deployment fails if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy |  |
| Host a| String |  The optional proxy host. |  |
| Port a| Number |  The optional proxy port. |  |

= Amazon SQS Connector 5.10 Studio Configuration - Mule 4

Anypoint Studio (Studio) editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.

To add and configure a connector in Studio:

. <<create-mule-project,Create a Mule project>>.
. <<add-connector-to-project,Add the connector to your Mule project>>.
. <<configure-input-source,Configure a source for the connector's flow>>.
. <<add-connector-operation,Add a connector operation to the flow>>.
. <<configure-global-element,Configure a global element for the connector>>.

When you run the connector, you can view the app log to check for problems, as described in <<view-app-log,View the App Log>>.


If you are new to configuring connectors in Studio, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-config-use-studio.adoc[Using Anypoint Studio to Configure a Connector]. If, after reading this topic, you need additional information about the connector fields, see the xref:amazon-sqs-connector-reference.adoc#node-behavior[Amazon SQS Connector Reference].

[[create-mule-project]]
== Create a Mule Project

In Studio, create a new Mule project in which to add and configure the connector:

. In Studio, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
. Enter a name for your Mule project and click *Finish*.


[[add-connector-to-project]]
== Add the Connector to Your Mule Project

Add Amazon SQS Connector to your Mule project to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location and add the required dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Modules to Project*, type `amazon sqs` in the search field.
. Click *Amazon SQS* in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.

[[configure-input-source]]
== Configure a Source

A source initiates a flow when a specified condition is met. You can configure one of these input sources to use with Amazon SQS Connector:

* *Receive messages* +
Retrieves one or more messages from the specified queue
* *HTTP > Listener* +
Initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port
* *Scheduler* +
Initiates a flow when a time-based condition is met

For example, to configure the *Receive messages* source operation, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *Amazon SQS > Receive messages*.
. Drag *Receive messages* to the Studio canvas.
. On the *Receive messages* configuration screen, optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. Specify values for the following fields:
+
* *Visibility Timeout* +
Period of time during which other consumers are prevented from receiving and processing the same message in the queue
* *Visibility Timeout unit* +
The time unit for the Visibility Timeout:
** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS
* *Preserve Messages* +
Preserve messages after they are read rather than immediately deleting them from the queue after they are read
* *Number Of Messages* +
Number of messages to retrieve
* *Queue Url* +
URL of the queue in which to receive messages
. If you are using the *Receive messages* source in cluster mode and want to receive messages on the primary node only, select the *Primary node only* checkbox on the *Receive messages > Advanced* tab:
+

+
For more information, see xref:amazon-sqs-connector-config-topics.adoc#node-behavior[Receiving Messages in Cluster Mode].


[[configure-global-element]]
== Configure a Global Element for the Connector

When you configure a connector, it’s best to configure a global element that all instances of that connector in the app can use. Configuring a global element requires you to provide the authentication credentials the connector uses to access the target Amazon SQS system. Amazon SQS supports the Basic and Role authentication methods for connections.

You can either enter your credentials into the global configuration properties or reference a configuration placed in a file in the `src` folder of your project file that contains these values. For simpler maintenance and better reuse of your project, use a configuration file.

. Drag a connector operation onto the Studio canvas.
. To create a global element for the connector, click the *Global Elements* tab at the base of the canvas, and then click *Create*.
. In the *Choose Global Type* window, expand *Connector Configuration* and select *Amazon SQS Configuration*:
+
image::amazon-sqs-studio-select-global.png[Select Connector for Global Element]
+
. Click *OK*.
. Specify the global element properties:
+
image::amazon-sqs-studio-global-config-new.png[Configure Global Element]
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|Name | Name used to reference the configuration
|Session Token | Session token used to validate the temporary security credentials
|Access Key |Alphanumeric text string that uniquely identifies the user who owns the account
|Secret Key |Key that acts as a password
|Try AWS Credentials Provider Chain|Drop-down menu that controls whether to use temporary credentials
|Region Endpoint |Regional endpoint to process your requests
|SQS Endpoint | SQS endpoint for Amazon VPC support.
|Default Global URL |URL of the Amazon SQS queue to act upon
|===
+
When you provide a queue URL in the *Default Global Queue URL* field of the global element, the connector automatically creates the queue and sets the URL of this queue as the provided value. All Amazon SQS message processors that reference the global element perform operations using this queue URL.
+
To reference a different queue URL for a particular message processor in the flow, perform the operation using the `Queue URL` attribute provided by the message processor.
. Leave the default entries for the *Proxy* tab.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that the parameters of your global configuration are accurate and that Mule is able to connect successfully to your instance of Amazon SQS. +
To test the connection, you must specify a value for the *Test Queue Arn* field in the configuration. If a value is not specified, the test connection is not performed, and the console displays a warning when the operation is invoked.
. Click *OK*.

[[view-app-log]]

== View the App Log

To check for problems, you can view the app log as follows:

* If you’re running the app from Anypoint Platform, the output is visible in the Anypoint Studio console window.
* If you’re running the app using Mule from the command line, the app log is visible in your OS console.

Unless the log file path is customized in the app’s log file (`log4j2.xml`), you can also view the app log in the default location `MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`.

== Next Step

After configuring this connector in Studio, see

[[PatchOrdersPaymentInstrumentsByOrderNoPaymentInstrumentId]]
== Patch Orders By IDPayment Instruments By ID
`<shop:patch-orders-payment-instruments-by-order-no-payment-instrument-id>`


Updates a payment instrument of an order and passes the order and updated payment instrument to the correct payment authorizeCreditcard or authorize hook. 

Details: 

* The payment instrument is updated with the provided details. 
* The payment method must be applicable for the order see GET /baskets/{basket_id}/payment_methods
* If the payment method is `CREDIT_CARD`, a payment_card must be specified in the request. 

The default implementation places the order if the order status is `CREATED` and the authorization amount equals or exceeds the order total. Placing the order (equivalent to calling `dw.order.OrderMgr.placeOrder(order : Order)` in the scripting API) results in the order being changed to status `NEW` and prepared for export. 

This operation makes an HTTP PATCH request to the `/orders/{order_no}/payment_instruments/{payment_instrument_id}` endpoint.

[[CreateBaskets]]
== Post Baskets
`<shop:create-baskets>`


Creates a new basket. The created basket is initialized with default values. Data provided in the body document will be populated into the created basket. It can be updated with further Shop API calls. 

Considered values from the request body are: 

* Customer information: PUT /baskets/{basket_id}/customer 
* Billing address: PUT /baskets/{basket_id}/billing_address 
* Shipments including shipping address and shipping method: POST /baskets/{basket_id}/shipments 
* Product items: POST /baskets/{basket_id}/items 
* Coupon items: POST /baskets/{basket_id}/coupons 
* Gift certificate items: POST /baskets/{basket_id}/gift_certificates 
* Payment method and card type: POST /baskets/{basket_id}/payment_instruments 
* Custom properties: PATCH /baskets/{basket_id} 

Related resource means with which resource you can specify the same data after the basket creation. Identify the basket using the `basket_id` property, which should be integrated into the path of an update request, for example, a POST to `/baskets/{basket_id}/items`. 

The resource supports JWT or OAuth tokens for authentication: 

* A customer must provide a JWT, which specifies exactly one customer (it may be a guest or a registered customer). In this case, the resource creates a basket for this customer. 
* An agent must provide an OAuth token. The agent can use this resource to create a basket for a newly created guest customer, and can later update the customer if desired. 

The number of baskets that can be created per customer is limited. When a basket is created it is said to be open. It remains open until either an order is created from it using a POST to the resource `/orders`, or it is deleted using a DELETE to resource `/baskets/{basket_id}`. 

The number of open baskets allowed depends on the authentication method used:

* When using JWT each customer can have just one open basket.
* When using OAuth each customer can have up to 4 open baskets. This is a quota setting, which can be updated by support. 

This operation makes an HTTP POST request to the `/baskets` endpoint.

[[CreateCustomersAuthByCustomerId]]
== Post Customers By IDAuth
`<shop:create-customers-auth-by-customer-id>`


Obtains a new agent on behalf of a token for a registered customer. The token is returned as a HTTP `Authorization:Bearer` response header entry. A token is created and returned to the client whenever an agent with `Create_Order_On_Behalf_Of` permission calls the resource for a registered customer. The token is returned in the response header as `Authorization: Bearer --token--`. 

The client has to include the token in the request header as `Authorization: Bearer --token--` in any followup request the agent will do on behalf of the customer. 

For the order on behalf token, the token contains three sections: 

. The header section (specifies token type and algorithm used)
. The payload section (contains customer information, client id, issue, and expiration time)
. Finally, the signature section records the token signature. A token nearing its expiration time should be exchanged for a new one by calling this resource once more. 

This operation makes an HTTP POST request to the `/customers/{customer_id}/auth` endpoint.

Searches for orders. The query attribute specifies a complex query that can be used to narrow down the search. Note that search fields are mandatory now and no default ones are supported. As in the earlier Order Search version, the latest version always uses Search Service as well, and for that reason, Order Incremental Indexing should be enabled. Otherwise, an `HTTP 500` response will occur. 

The supported search fields are: 

* Aaffiliate_partner_i_d 
* Affiliate_partner_name 
* Business_type 
* Channel_type 
* Confirmation_status (String) 
* Created_by

* Return_cases : Return_case_number
* Shipments : Shipping_method_id 
* shipping_orders: shipping_order_number 
* Custom attributes could be used as search fields and as sort fields too. A prefix "c_" must be added to them. 

The sort order of the retrieved orders can be specified by the `sorts` parameter. It is a list of objects presenting field name and sort direction (`asc` or `desc`).

This operation makes an HTTP POST request to the `/order_search` endpoint.

[[CreateOrdersPaymentInstrumentsByOrderNo]]
== Post Orders By IDPayment Instruments
`<shop:create-orders-payment-instruments-by-order-no>`


Adds a payment instrument to an order. It is possible to supply either the full payment information or only a customer payment instrument ID and amount. In case the customer payment instrument ID was set, all the other properties (except amount) are ignored and the payment data is resolved from the stored customer payment information. An attempt is made to authorize the order by passing it to the authorize or authorizeCreditCard hook. 

Details: 

* The payment instrument is added with the provided details or the details from the customer payment instrument. 
* The payment method must be applicable for the order see GET /baskets/{basket_id}/payment_methods, if the payment method is 'CREDIT_CARD' a payment_card must be specified in the request. 
* The default implementation places the order if the order status is CREATED and the authorization amount equals or exceeds the order total. Placing the order (equivalent to calling dw.order.OrderMgr.placeOrder(order : Order) in the scripting API) results in the order being changed to status NEW and prepared for export. 

This operation makes an HTTP POST request to the `/orders/{order_no}/payment_instruments` endpoint.

[[CreateSessions]]
== Post Sessions
`<shop:create-sessions>`


Exchanges a valid JWT into a new session, which is associated with the authenticated or anonymous customer. All `Set-Cookie` headers for handling the session are applied on the response. Only the JWT is used to create the new session. Any session IDs included in the request are ignored. 

Once you create a session from a JWT, you can use it in parallel with stateless OCAPI calls that use the JWT. There is no need to call the bridging resources again. If the customer is authenticated and has a storefront basket, that basket is transferred into the session and can be retrieved using `BasketMgr.getCurrentBasket()`, along with sensitive data such as addresses and payment information. 

This operation makes an HTTP POST request to the `/sessions` endpoint.

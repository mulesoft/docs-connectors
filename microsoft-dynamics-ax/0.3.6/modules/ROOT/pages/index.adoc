[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Operation |Description
|*Query table* |Run a query against an Application Object Tree (AOT) Table. For more information, see the Microsoft https://msdn.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/bb314725.aspx[AOT table] site.
|*Static query* |Run an https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb394994.aspx[AOT static query].
|===

== Before You Begin

Install the xref:3.6@mule-runtime::windows-gateway-services-guide.adoc[Windows Gateway Services]

=== Windows Gateway Services for Anypoint Platform

The Windows Gateway Services agent performs protocol translation when calling the Dynamics AX System Services. The Dynamics AX System Services (Metadata Service, Query Service) use the `net.tcp` protocol which is not implemented in Java.

To execute requests, the connector routes the requests through the Windows Gateway Services as follows:

. The connector sends an HTTP request to the Windows Gateway Services.
. The Windows Gateway Services receives the HTTP request.
. The Windows Gateway Services executes the request against the Dynamics AX System Services using the ` net.tcp ` protocol.
. The Windows Gateway Services receives the response from the Dynamics AX System Services.
. The Windows Gateway Services sends the response to the connector over HTTP.
. The connector receives the response.

All communication between the Anypoint Platform and Windows Gateway Services is authenticated and secured by SSL.

|===
|Operation |Description
|*Query table* |Run a query against an Application Object Tree (AOT) Table. For more information, see the Microsoft https://msdn.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/bb314725.aspx[AOT table] site.
|*Static query* |Run an https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb394994.aspx[AOT static query].  +
|*Document Service* |Call an https://technet.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/bb496530.aspx[AIF Document Service].
|===

== Prerequisites

The following prerequisites must be satisfied before running the Dynamics AX connector:

* Install the https://repository-master.mulesoft.org/nexus/content/repositories/releases/org/mule/modules/anypoint-windows-gateway-service/1.9.0/anypoint-windows-gateway-service-1.9.0.zip[Windows Gateway Services]. Just go through the wizard by clicking the *Install* button if you plan to use this connector alone, otherwise take a look at its xref:3.7@mule-runtime::windows-gateway-services-guide.adoc[reference documentation] for settings that apply to other connectors as well.

=== Windows Gateway Services for Anypoint Platform

The xref:3.7@mule-runtime::windows-gateway-services-guide.adoc[Windows Gateway Services] perform protocol translation when calling the Dynamics AX System Services. The Dynamics AX System Services (Metadata Service, Query Service) use the `net.tcp` protocol which is not implemented in Java.

To execute requests, the connector routes the requests through the Windows Gateway Services as follows:

. The connector sends an HTTP request to the Windows Gateway Services.
. The Windows Gateway Services receives the HTTP request.
. The Windows Gateway Services executes the request against the Dynamics AX System Services using the `net.tcp` protocol.
. The Windows Gateway Services receives the response from the Dynamics AX System Services.
. The Windows Gateway Services sends the response to the connector over HTTP.
. The connector receives the response.

All communication between the Anypoint Platform and Windows Gateway Services is authenticated and secured by SSL.

== Use Case Example

=== Starting the Demo

. Import the project folder in Studio.
. Update the Microsoft Dynamics AX connection parameters in `/src/main/app/mule-app.properties`.
. Click *Test Connection* to make sure the connection works correctly.
. Run the application.

=== Running the Demo

The demo includes the following operations:

* Query all projects from *ProjTable* table:  +
 `http://localhost:8081/projects`
* List all projects (static query *ProjListProjectTable*):  +
 `http://localhost:8081/list-projects`
* Get project by ProjId (static query *ProjListProjectTable*):  `http://localhost:8081/list-projects?ProjId={projid}`

== Datasense

When inbound/outbound ports are not configured over the net.tcp adapter their metadata is not retrieved and, in consequence, they are not shown through Datasense. In addition, net.tcp services that are not deployed within the AOS are not shown either.

== Operations

=== Query Table

Run a query on an https://msdn.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/bb314725.aspx[AOT table].

=== Static Query

Run an https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb394994.aspx[AOT static query].

==== Static Query Input

The following table details the operation’s input parameters.

[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|staticQueryName |The name of the static query to execute.
|fetchSize |The size of the page for paging the results.
|_Message Payload_ |For static queries that accept input parameters, a `Map<String, Object>` with the parameter names and values.
|===

==== Static Query Output

A list with the results of the static query.

=== Document Service

Call an https://technet.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/bb496530.aspx[AIF Document Service].

==== Document Service Input

The following table details the operation's input parameters.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|serviceAndSoapActionUri |The Document Service name and the SOAP action URI, concatenated in the format: +
`_service-name soapActionUri_`
|_Message Payload_ |The XML document that is sent to the operation.
|===

==== Output

The result of invoking the Document Service operation.

== Troubleshooting

In case of errors while executing AX operations through the connector, there are a number of steps that you can follow depending on the nature of the issue.

=== Timeouts

If you receive a timeout while executing any operation using the connector, then you should properly set the `Connection timeout` & `Reception timeout` parameters described at the connector's settings table shown above (<<Step 2: Create and Configure a New Microsoft Dynamics AX Global Element>>). In addition to the connector's timeout settings, there are timeouts that you should check/set at the *Windows Gateway Services* (who is the responsible of routing your requests to the AX server). For more information please refer to the xref:3.7@mule-runtime::windows-gateway-services-guide.adoc#ax-specific[Windows Gateway Services] reference documentation.

=== Other issues

For other issues it is recommended to see the xref:3.7@mule-runtime::windows-gateway-services-guide.adoc#windows-gateway-service-troubleshooting[troubleshooting] section at the Windows Gateway Services reference documentation. There are *message size* related settings (xref:3.7@mule-runtime::windows-gateway-services-guide.adoc#ax-specific[AX configuration]) that you can increase if you suspect the issue might be related with the response's payload of the operation you are executing. In addition, within that section, there are many helpful tips on tracing/debugging that could give you insights on what could be causing the problem.

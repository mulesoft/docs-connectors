|Operation |Description
|*Query table* |Run a query against an Application Object Tree (AOT) Table. For more information, see the Microsoft https://msdn.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/bb314725.aspx[AOT table] site.
|*Static query* |Run an https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb394994.aspx[AOT static query].  +
|*Document Service* |Call an https://technet.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/bb496530.aspx[AIF Document Service].
|===

== Before You Begin

The following prerequisites must be satisfied before running the Dynamics AX connector:

Install the xref:3.9@mule-runtime::windows-gateway-services-guide.adoc[Windows Gateway Services]


=== Windows Gateway Services for Anypoint Platform

The https://repository-master.mulesoft.org/nexus/content/repositories/releases/org/mule/modules/anypoint-windows-gateway-service/1.6.0/anypoint-windows-gateway-service-1.6.0.zip[Windows Gateway Services] agent performs protocol translation when calling the Dynamics AX System Services. The Dynamics AX System Services (Metadata Service, Query Service) use the `net.tcp` protocol which is not implemented in Java.

To execute requests, the connector routes the requests through the Windows Gateway Services as follows:

. The connector sends an HTTP request to the Windows Gateway Services.
. The Windows Gateway Services receives the HTTP request.
. The Windows Gateway Services executes the request against the Dynamics AX System Services using the `net.tcp` protocol.
. The Windows Gateway Services receives the response from the Dynamics AX System Services.
. The Windows Gateway Services sends the response to the connector over HTTP.
. The connector receives the response.

All communication between the Anypoint Platform and Windows Gateway Services is authenticated and secured by SSL.

== To Install this Connector

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio taskbar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange.
. Search for the connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

When Studio has an update, a message displays in the lower right corner, which you can click to install the update.

== Configuring the Connector

=== Step 1: Create a New Mule Project

Open *Anypoint Studio* and create a new project:

. From the menu, select *File* > *New* > *Mule Project*.
. In the *New Mule Project* window, enter *ax-demo* as the *Project Name*.
. Click *Finish*.

=== Step 2: Create and Configure a New Microsoft Dynamics AX Global Element

Configure the connector’s connection:

. Click the *Global Elements* tab.
. Click *Create* to bring up *Global Type* dialog box.
. In the *Search* text box, enter *ax*.
. Select *Microsoft Dynamics AX: Gateway Connection* and click *OK*.
. Fill in the required parameters:
+
[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|*Username* |The username to connect to Dynamics AX.
|*Password* |The password to connect to Dynamics AX.
|*AOS Server Name* |The name or IP of the server on which the *Application Object Server* is running.
|*AOS Services WSDL Port* |(v 1.1.0 and newer) The port number that the WSDL Services runs on. The default port number is `8101`.

. Click *Test Connection* to make sure the connection works correctly.
. Once the connection is successful, click *OK*.

=== Step 3: Create a Flow to Query Dynamics AX

Creating a Mule flow to query the "ProjTable".

image::query-table-flow.png[]

To create the Mule flow, follow these steps:

. Click the *Message Flow* tab.
. Search for *http* and drag an *HTTP* connector onto the canvas. This creates a new flow.
. Search for *ax* and drag the *Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012* connector next to the *HTTP* connector, in the *Process* area.
. Search for *json* and drag an *Object to JSON* transformer next to *Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012*.
. Double-click the *HTTP* connector. Click the plus sign (*+*) beside the *Connector Configuration* list.
. In the *HTTP Listener Configuration* window, make sure *Protocol* is set to *HTTP*, *Host* is set to *All Interfaces [0.0.0.0] (Default)* and *Port* is set to *8081*. Click *OK*.
. Under *Basic Settings*, set the *Path* to */query*.
. Double-click *Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012* and update the following configuration values:
.. From the *Connector Configuration* list, select the *Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012  Connector* configuration that was previously created.
.. From the *Operation* list, select *Query table*.
.. From the *Language* list, click *DataSense Query Language*.
.. Click *Query Builder…*
.. From the list of *Types*, select *ProjTable*.
.. From the list of *Fields*, select *ProjId* and *ProjGroupId*.
.. From the *Order By* dropdown, select *ProjId*.
.. From the *Direction* dropdown, select *DESCENDING*.
+
//image:query-table-config.png[]
+
. Click *OK*.

=== Step 4: Running the Flow

. In *Package Explorer*, right click *demo-ax* and select *Run As* > *Mule Application*.
. Check the console to see when the application starts. You should see the following message if no errors occurred:

== Using the Connector

=== Namespace and Schema

When designing your application in Studio, the act of dragging the connector from the palette onto the Anypoint Studio canvas should automatically populate the XML code with the connector *namespace* and *schema location*.

*Namespace:* `http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/dynamicsax`
*Schema Location:* `http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/dynamicsax/current/mule-dynamicsax.xsd`

[TIP]
If you are manually coding the Mule application in Studio's XML editor or other text editor, paste these into the header of your *Configuration XML*, inside the `<mule>` tag.

[source,xml]
----
<mule xmlns:dynamicsax="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/dynamicsax"
  ...
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/dynamicsax http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/dynamicsax/current/mule-dynamicsax.xsd">
  ...
  <flow name="yourFlow">
  ...
  </flow>
</mule>
----

=== Using Call Context

The connector supports providing a fixed https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh582244.aspx[Call Context] within each call that can be setup at the configuration tab with the same name.

Within the configuration section you can set the following:

[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
|Setting |Description
|*Company* |This is the Microsoft Dynamics AX company for the data on which the service operation is performed.
If Company is not specified then the calling user’s default company is used.
|*Language* |This is the Microsoft Dynamics AX LanguageID for the language that is used to display messages.
The default value for Language is 'en-us'.
|*Logon As User* |This is the Microsoft Dynamics AX user who performs the service operation. It uses the submitting user (calling user) in the format 'domain\user'.
If LogonAsUser is not specified then the user who makes the service operation call is used. The default user depends on the adapter that is selected. For example, when you use the file system adapter the default user is the owner of the folder where the file resides.
|*Message ID* |This is the GUID that uniquely identifies each document.
If you do not specify a message ID, the system generates one. However, if you want to identify a particular message for debugging, you must specify the message ID as part of the call context.
|*Partition Key* |This value identifies the partition that contains data that is referenced by the service operation.
The default value for PartitionKey is the default partition set for the calling user.
|===

=== Using the Connector in a Mavenized Mule App

If you are coding a Mavenized Mule application, this XML snippet must be included in your `pom.xml` file.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.mule.modules</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-module-dynamics-ax-2012</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
</dependency>
----

Replace `x.x.x` with the version that corresponds to the connector you are using.

To obtain the most up-to-date `pom.xml` file information, access the connector in https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Anypoint Exchange] and click *Dependency Snippets*.

= Apache Kafka Connector 4.8 Reference - Mule 4




Anypoint Connector for Apache Kafka (Apache Kafka Connector) enables you to interact with the Apache Kafka messaging system. It provides seamless integration between your Mule app and an Apache Kafka cluster, using Mule runtime engine (Mule).

[NOTE]
When a *Message Listener* or a *Batch Message Listener* uses the `MANUAL` acknowledgement mode, you must use a *Commit* operation at the end of the flow when the flow finishes successfully (either because there were no errors or because there is an *On Error Continue* component in the flow).

[NOTE]
Mule server notifications are not supported because the Kafka library used in the connector manages network disruptions internally.

|Default acknowledgement mode a| Enumeration, one of

** AUTO
** MANUAL
** IMMEDIATE
** DUPS_OK | Defines the way that the Kafka Broker instance is notified of the consumption of messages.

* AUTO
+
Commits messages automatically if the flow finishes successfully.

* MANUAL
+
The user must commit messages manually upon receipt by using the *Commit* operation.

* IMMEDIATE
+
Mule automatically commits the messages upon receipt before triggering the flow.

* DUPS_OK
+
Works in the same way as MANUAL, but the commits are asynchronous, which can lead to duplicate records. | `AUTO` |
| Default listener poll timeout a| Number |  Time to wait to perform a poll if data is not available in the buffer (fetched). If no value is set, the poll is returned immediately with any records that are currently available in the buffer or else returns empty if there is no data. Must not be negative. |  `100` |
| Default listener poll timeout time unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Time unit for the *Default listener poll timeout* field. This combines with *Poll Timeout* to define the total timeout for the polling. |  `MILLISECONDS` |
| Default operation poll timeout a| Number |  Time to wait for an operation to finish. If no value is set or a negative value is set, the operation waits forever. | `-1` |
| Default operation poll timeout time unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Time unit for the *Default operation timeout* field. This combines with *Operation Timeout* to define the total default timeout for the operations that use this configuration. |  `SECONDS` |

[[consumer-plaintext]]
=== Consumer Plaintext Connection Type

Use an unauthenticated and non-encrypted connection type.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Bootstrap Server URLs a| Array of String |  List of servers to bootstrap the connection with the Kafka cluster. This can be a partial list of the available servers. |  | x
| Group ID a| String |  Default group ID for all the Kafka consumers that use this configuration. |  |
| Consumer Amount a| Number | Determines the number of consumers the connection initially creates.  |  `1` |
| Maximum polling interval a| Number |  The maximum delay between invocations of poll() when using consumer group management. This places an upper bound on the amount of time that the consumer can be idle before fetching more records. If poll() is not called before the expiration of this timeout, then the consumer is considered failed and the group rebalances to reassign the partitions to another member. For consumers using a non-null `group.instance.id` which reaches this timeout, partitions are not immediately reassigned. Instead, the consumer stops sending heartbeats and partitions are reassigned after the expiration of `session.timeout.ms`. |  `60` |
| Maximum Polling Interval Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Time unit for the *Maximum polling interval* field. You can override this parameter at the source level. |  `SECONDS` |
| Isolation Level a| Enumeration, one of:

** READ_UNCOMMITTED
** READ_COMMITTED a| Controls how to read messages that are written transactionally.

* `READ_COMMITTED`
+
`consumer.poll()` returns only committed transactional messages are returned.

* `READ_UNCOMMITTED`
+
`consumer.poll()` returns all messages, even transactional messages that were aborted.

Non-transactional messages are returned unconditionally in either mode. Messages are always returned in offset order. Hence, in the `READ_COMMITTED` mode, `consumer.poll()` returns only messages up to the last stable offset (LSO), which is one less than the offset of the first open transaction.

In particular, any messages appearing after messages belonging to ongoing transactions are withheld until the relevant transaction is completed. As a result, `READ_COMMITTED` consumers are not able to read up to the high watermark when there are in-flight transactions. Furthermore, when in `READ_COMMITTED`, the `seekToEnd` method returns the LSO. |  `READ_UNCOMMITTED` |
| Exclude internal topics a| Boolean |  Determines whether internal topics matching a subscribed pattern are excluded from the subscription. It is always possible to explicitly subscribe to an internal topic. |  `true` |
| Auto offset reset a| Enumeration, one of:

** EARLIEST
** LATEST
** ERROR a| Determines what to do when there is no initial offset in Kafka or if the current offset no longer exists on the server, for example, because the data was deleted.

* EARLIEST
+
Automatically reset the offset to the earliest offset.

* LATEST
+
Automatically reset the offset to the latest offset.

* ERROR
+
Throw an error if no previous offset is found for the consumer's group. | `LATEST` |
| Retry Backoff Timeout a| Number |  Amount of time to wait before attempting to retry a failed request to a given topic partition. This avoids repeatedly sending requests in a tight loop under some failure scenarios. |  `100` |
| Retry Backoff Timeout Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Time unit for the *Retry Backoff Timeout* field. |  `MILLISECONDS` |
| Check CRC a| Boolean |  Automatically check the CRC32 of the records consumed. This ensures that no on-the-wire or on-disk corruption to the messages occurred. This check adds some overhead, so in situations that require extremely high performance, this can be disabled. |  `true` |
| Default receive buffer size a| Number | Size of the TCP receive buffer (SO_RCVBUF) to use when reading data. If the value is `-1`, the OS default is used. You can override this parameter at the source level. | `64` |
| Default receive buffer size unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB |  Unit of measure for the *Default receive buffer size* field. You can override this parameter at the source level. | `KB` |
| Default send buffer size a| Number |  Size of the TCP send buffer (SO_SNDBUF) to use when sending data. If the value is `-1`, the OS default is used. You can override this parameter at the source level. | `128` |
| Default send buffer size unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB |  Unit of measure for the *Default send buffer size* field. You can override this parameter at the source level. | `KB` |
| Request Timeout a| Number |  Maximum amount of time the client waits for the response of a request. If the response is not received before the timeout elapses, the client resends the request if necessary, or fails the request if the retries are exhausted. You can override this parameter at the source level. |  `30` |
| Request Timeout Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Time unit for the *Request Timeout* field. You can override this parameter at the source level. | `SECONDS` |
| Default record limit a| Number |  Maximum number of records returned on a poll call to the Kafka cluster. You can override this parameter at the source level. |  `500` |
| DNS Lookups a| Enumeration, one of:

** DEFAULT
** USE_ALL_DNS_IPS
** RESOLVE_CANONICAL_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_ONLY |  Controls how the client uses DNS lookups. If set to USE_ALL_DNS_IPS then, when the lookup returns multiple IP addresses for a hostname, they attempt to connect before failing the connection. Applies to both bootstrap and advertised servers. If the value is RESOLVE_CANONICAL_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_ONLY each entry is resolved and expanded into a list of canonical names.

* `USE_ALL_DNS_IPS`
+
When the lookup returns multiple IP addresses for a hostname, a connection is attempted to all of the IP addresses before the connection fails. Applies to both bootstrap and advertised servers.

* `RESOLVE_CANONICAL_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_ONLY`
+
Each entry is resolved and expanded into a list of canonical names. | `USE_ALL_DNS_IPS` |

| Heartbeat interval a| Number |  Expected time between heartbeats to the consumer coordinator when using Kafka's group management facilities. Heartbeats are used to ensure that the consumer's session stays active and to facilitate rebalancing when new consumers join or leave the group. The value must be set lower than `session.timeout.ms`, but typically should be set no higher than 1/3 of that value. It can be adjusted even lower to control the expected time for normal rebalances. | `3` |
| Heartbeat Interval Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Time unit for the *Heartbeat interval* field. |  `SECONDS` |
| Session Timeout a| Number |  Timeout used to detect consumer failures when using Kafka's group management facility. The consumer sends periodic heartbeats to indicate its aliveness to the broker. If no heartbeats are received by the broker before the expiration of this session timeout, then the broker removes this consumer from the group and initiates a rebalance. The value must be in the allowable range as configured in the broker configuration by `group.min.session.timeout.ms` and `group.max.session.timeout.ms`. |  `10` |
| Session timeout time unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Time unit for the *Session Timeout* field. |  `SECONDS` |
| Connection maximum idle time a| Number |  Close idle connections after the number of milliseconds specified by this configuration. |  `540` |
| Connection maximum idle time time unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Time unit for the *Connection maximum idle time* field. |  `SECONDS` |
| Additional Properties a| Object |  Additional properties used to customize the Kafka connection. |  | 
| TLS Configuration a| <<Tls>> | Defines a TLS configuration used by both clients and server sides to secure the communication for the Mule app. The connector automatically sets the `security.protocol` to use for the communication. The valid values are `PLAINTEXT`, `SSL`, `SASL_PLAINTEXT`, or `SASL_SSL`. The default value is `PLAINTEXT` or `SASL_PLAINTEXT` for SASL authentication - kerberos/scram/plain. If the broker configures `SSL` as the protocol, then configure at least the keystore in the `tls:context` child element of the configuration and the connector automatically uses `SSL` (or `SASL_SSL` for SASL authentication) as the `security.protocol`. | |
| Endpoint identification algorithm | String | Endpoint identification algorithm used by clients to validate the server hostname. The default value is an empty string, which means the endpoint identification algorithm is disabled. Clients, including client connections created by the broker for inter-broker communication, verify that the broker host name matches the host name in the brokers certificate. | |
| Topic Subscription Patterns a| Array of String |  List of subscription regular expressions to which to subscribe. Topics are automatically rebalanced between the topic consumers.|  |
| Assignments a| Array of <<TopicPartition>> |  List of topic-partition pairs to assign. Consumers are not automatically rebalanced.  |  |
| Default fetch minimum size a| Number |  Minimum amount of data the server returns for a fetch request. If insufficient data is available, the request waits for the specified minimum amount of data to accumulate before answering the request. The default setting of `1` byte means that fetch requests are answered as soon as a single byte of data is available or the fetch request times out waiting for data to arrive. If you set this to a value greater than `1`, the server waits for larger amounts of data to accumulate, which can improve server throughput slightly at the cost of some additional latency. You can override this parameter at the source level. |  `1` |
| Fetch Minimum Size Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | Unit of measure for the *Default fetch minimum size* field. You can override this parameter at the source level. | `BYTE` |
| Default fetch maximum size a| Number |  Maximum amount of data the server returns for a fetch request. Records are fetched in batches by the consumer. If the first record batch in the first non-empty partition of the fetch is larger than this value, the record batch is still returned to ensure that the consumer can make progress. As such, this is not an absolute maximum. The maximum record batch size accepted by the broker is defined using `message.max.bytes` (broker configuration) or `max.message.bytes` (topic configuration). The consumer performs multiple fetches in parallel. You can override this parameter at the source level. |  `1` |
| Default maximum fetch size unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB |  Unit of measure for the *Default fetch maximum size* field. You can override this parameter at the source level. |  `MB` |
| Default maximum partition fetch size a| Number |  Maximum amount of data per partition that the server returns. The consumer fetches records in batches. If the first record batch in the first non-empty partition of the fetch is larger than this limit, the batch is still returned to ensure that the consumer can make progress. The maximum record batch size accepted by the broker is defined using `message.max.bytes` (broker configuration) or `max.message.bytes` (topic configuration). See `fetch.max.bytes` for limiting the consumer request size. You can override this parameter at the source level. |  `1` |
| Default maximum partition fetch unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB |  Unit of measure for the *Default maximum partition fetch size* field. You can override this parameter at the source level. |  `MB` |
| Fetch Maximum Wait Timeout a| Number |  Maximum amount of time the server blocks before answering the fetch request if there isn't sufficient data to immediately satisfy the requirement specified by `fetch.min.bytes`. |  `500` |
| Fetch Maximum Wait Timeout Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Time unit for the *Fetch Maximum Wait Timeout* field. |  `MILLISECONDS` |
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  Configures a reconnection strategy to use when a connector operation fails to connect to an external server. |  |

| Use ticket cache a| Boolean |  Set this option to `true` to obtain the ticket-granting ticket (TGT) from the ticket cache. Set this option to `false` if you do not want to use the ticket cache. The connector searches for the ticket cache as follows:

* On Solaris and Linux, the connector looks in `/tmp/krb5cc_uid`, in which the `uid` is the numeric user identifier.
* If the ticket cache is not available in `/tmp/krb5cc_uid` or the app is on a Windows platform, the connector looks in `{user.home}{file.separator}krb5cc_{user.name}`.
You can override the ticket cache location by setting a value for the *Ticket cache* field.

{sp} +
In a Windows environment, if a ticket cannot be retrieved from the file ticket cache, Windows uses the Local Security Authority (LSA) API to get the ticket-granting ticket (TGT). |  `false` |
| Ticket cache a| String |  Name of the ticket cache that contains the user's ticket-granting ticket (TGT). If this value is set, *Use ticket cache* must also be set to `true`. Otherwise, a configuration error is returned. |  |
| Use keytab a| Boolean |  Set this option to `true` if you want the connector to obtain the principal's key from the keytab. If you don't set this value, the connector locates the keytab by using the Kerberos configuration file. If the keytab is not specified in the Kerberos configuration file, the connector looks for the `{user.home}{file.separator}krb5.keytab` file. |  `false` |
| Keytab a| String |  Set this option to the file name of the keytab to obtain the principal's secret key. |  |
| Store key a| Boolean |  Set this option to `true` to store the principal's subject private credentials. |  `false` |
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  Configures a reconnection strategy to use when a connector operation fails to connect to an external server. |  |

| Endpoint identification algorithm a| String |  The endpoint identification algorithm used by clients to validate server host name. The default value is an empty string, which means it is disabled. Clients including client connections created by the broker for inter-broker communication verify that the broker host name matches the host name in the brokers certificate. |  | 
| Group ID a| String |  Default Group ID for all the Kafka Consumers that use this configuration. |  | 
| Consumer Amount a| Number |  Determines the number of consumers the connection initially creates. |  1 | 
| Maximum polling interval a| Number |  The maximum delay between invocations of poll() when using consumer group management. This places an upper bound on the amount of time that the consumer can be idle before fetching more records. If poll() is not called before the expiration of this timeout, then the consumer is considered failed and the group rebalances to reassign the partitions to another member. For consumers using a non-null `group.instance.id` which reaches this timeout, partitions are not immediately reassigned. Instead, the consumer stops sending heartbeats and partitions are reassigned after the expiration of `session.timeout.ms`. |  60 | 
| Maximum Polling Interval Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** READ_UNCOMMITTED
** READ_COMMITTED |  Controls how to read messages that are written transactionally.

* `READ_COMMITTED`
+
`consumer.poll()` returns only committed transactional messages are returned.

* `READ_UNCOMMITTED`
+
`consumer.poll()` returns all messages, even transactional messages that were aborted.

Non-transactional messages are returned unconditionally in either mode. Messages are always returned in offset order. Hence, in the `READ_COMMITTED` mode, `consumer.poll()` returns only messages up to the last stable offset (LSO), which is one less than the offset of the first open transaction.

In particular, any messages appearing after messages belonging to ongoing transactions are withheld until the relevant transaction is completed. As a result, `READ_COMMITTED` consumers are not able to read up to the high watermark when there are in-flight transactions. Furthermore, when in `READ_COMMITTED`, the `seekToEnd` method returns the LSO. |  READ_UNCOMMITTED |

* ERROR
+
Throw an error if no previous offset is found for the consumer's group. |  `LATEST` |

Default value when no configuration has been provided is PLAINTEXT(or SASL_PLAINTEXT for SASL authentication - kerberos/scram/plain/token). If SSL was configured as protocol on the broker side then the user needs to configure at least the keystore in the 'tls:context' child element of this config and the connector will automatically use SSL(or SASL_SSL for SASL authentication) as 'security.protocol'. |  |

The default setting of 1 byte means that fetch requests are answered as soon as a single byte of data is available or the fetch request times out waiting for data to arrive. Setting this to something greater than 1 will cause the server to wait for larger amounts of data to accumulate which can improve server throughput a bit at the cost of some additional latency. This parameter can be overridden at source level. |  1 |

* `READ_UNCOMMITTED`
+
`consumer.poll()` returns all messages, even transactional messages that were aborted.

Non-transactional messages are returned unconditionally in either mode. Messages are always returned in offset order. Hence, in the `READ_COMMITTED` mode, `consumer.poll()` returns only messages up to the last stable offset (LSO), which is one less than the offset of the first open transaction.

In particular, any messages appearing after messages belonging to ongoing transactions are withheld until the relevant transaction is completed. As a result, `READ_COMMITTED` consumers are not able to read up to the high watermark when there are in-flight transactions. Furthermore, when in `READ_COMMITTED`, the `seekToEnd` method returns the LSO. |  `READ_UNCOMMITTED` |

Automatically reset the offset to the latest offset.

* ERROR
+
Throw an error if no previous offset is found for the consumer's group. | `LATEST` |

| Heartbeat interval a| Number |  Expected time between heartbeats to the consumer coordinator when using Kafka's group management facilities. Heartbeats are used to ensure that the consumer's session stays active and to facilitate rebalancing when new consumers join or leave the group. The value must be set lower than `session.timeout.ms`, but typically should be set no higher than 1/3 of that value. It can be adjusted even lower to control the expected time for normal rebalances. | `3` |

| Session Timeout a| Number |  Timeout used to detect consumer failures when using Kafka's group management facility. The consumer sends periodic heartbeats to indicate its aliveness to the broker. If no heartbeats are received by the broker before the expiration of this session timeout, then the broker removes this consumer from the group and initiates a rebalance. The value must be in the allowable range as configured in the broker configuration by `group.min.session.timeout.ms` and `group.max.session.timeout.ms`. |  `10` |

| Additional Properties a| Object |  Additional properties used to customize the Kafka connection. |  | 
| TLS Configuration a| <<Tls>> | Defines a TLS configuration used by both clients and server sides to secure the communication for the Mule app. The connector automatically sets the `security.protocol` to use for the communication. The valid values are `PLAINTEXT`, `SSL`, `SASL_PLAINTEXT`, or `SASL_SSL`. The default value is `PLAINTEXT` or `SASL_PLAINTEXT` for SASL authentication - kerberos/scram/plain. If the broker configures `SSL` as the protocol, then configure at least the keystore in the `tls:context` child element of the configuration and the connector automatically uses `SSL` (or `SASL_SSL` for SASL authentication) as the `security.protocol`. | |
| Endpoint identification algorithm | String | Endpoint identification algorithm used by clients to validate the server hostname. The default value is an empty string, which means the endpoint identification algorithm is disabled. Clients, including client connections created by the broker for inter-broker communication, verify that the broker host name matches the host name in the brokers certificate. | |

| Default fetch minimum size a| Number |  Minimum amount of data the server returns for a fetch request. If insufficient data is available, the request waits for the specified minimum amount of data to accumulate before answering the request. The default setting of `1` byte means that fetch requests are answered as soon as a single byte of data is available or the fetch request times out waiting for data to arrive. If you set this to a value greater than `1`, the server waits for larger amounts of data to accumulate, which can improve server throughput slightly at the cost of some additional latency. You can override this parameter at the source level. |  `1` |

** GB | Unit of measure for the *Default fetch minimum size* field. You can override this parameter at the source level. | `BYTE` |
| Default fetch maximum size a| Number |  Maximum amount of data the server returns for a fetch request. Records are fetched in batches by the consumer. If the first record batch in the first non-empty partition of the fetch is larger than this value, the record batch is still returned to ensure that the consumer can make progress. As such, this is not an absolute maximum. The maximum record batch size accepted by the broker is defined using `message.max.bytes` (broker configuration) or `max.message.bytes` (topic configuration). The consumer performs multiple fetches in parallel. You can override this parameter at the source level. |  `1` |

If the first record batch in the first non-empty partition of the fetch is larger than this limit, the batch is still returned to ensure that the consumer can make progress. The maximum record batch size accepted by the broker is defined using `message.max.bytes` (broker configuration) or `max.message.bytes` (topic configuration). See `fetch.max.bytes` for limiting the consumer request size. You can override this parameter at the source level. |  `1` |

| Batch size a| Number |  Producer attempts to batch records together into fewer requests whenever multiple records are sent to the same partition. This helps performance on both the client and the server. This configuration controls the default batch size in bytes. No attempt is made to batch records larger than this size. Requests sent to brokers contain multiple batches, one for each partition with the data that is available to send. A small batch size makes batching less common and can reduce throughput (a batch size of `0` disables batching entirely). A very large batch size can result in more wasteful use of memory as a buffer of the specified batch size is always allocated in anticipation of additional records. |  `16` |
| The batch size unit of measure. a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB |  Unit of measure for the *Batch size* field. |  `KB` |
| Buffer size a| Number |  Total bytes of memory the producer uses to buffer records waiting to send to the server. If records are sent faster than they are delivered to the server, the producer blocks for `max.block.ms`, after which it throws an exception. This setting generally corresponds to the total memory the producer uses, but is not exact because the memory used by the producer is not all used for buffering. Some additional memory is used for compression (if compression is enabled), as well as for maintaining in-flight requests. The default value in the Apache Kafka documentation is `33554432` (32MB), but this should be capped to align with expected values for Mule instances in CloudHub (v0.1 core). |  `1` |

** NONE
** GZIP
** SNAPPY
** LZ4
** ZSTD |  Compression type for all data generated by the producer. The default is `NONE` (no compression). Compression works on full batches of data, so the efficacy of batching also impacts the compression ratio. More batching means better compression. |  `NONE` |

** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Time unit for the *Connections maximum idle time* field. | `SECONDS` |
| Delivery Timeout a| Number |  Upper limit on the time to report success or failure after a call to `send()` returns. This limits the total time that a record is delayed prior to sending, the time to await acknowledgment from the broker (if expected), and the time allowed for retrying send failures. The producer might report failure to send a record earlier than this configuration if either an unrecoverable error is encountered, the retries have been exhausted, or the record is added to a batch that reached an earlier delivery expiration deadline. The value of this configuration must be greater than or equal to the sum of `request.timeout.ms` and `linger.ms`. | `120` |

| Enable idempotence a| Boolean |  When set to `true`, the producer ensures that exactly one copy of each message is written in the stream. If `false`, the producer retries due to broker failures and might write duplicates of the retried message in the stream. Enabling idempotence requires `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` to be less than or equal to `5`, retries to be greater than `0`. and acks to be `all`. If these values are not explicitly set by the user, suitable values are chosen. If incompatible values are set, a `ConnectionException` is thrown. |  `false` |
| Linger time  a| Number a| Producer groups together any records that arrive in between request transmissions into a single batched request. Normally this occurs only under load when records arrive faster than they are sent out. However, in some circumstances the client might want to reduce the number of requests, even under moderate load.
{sp} +
{sp} +
This setting accomplishes this by adding a small amount of artificial delay (rather than immediately sending out a record the producer waits for up to the given delay to allow other records to be sent so that the sends can be batched together). This is analogous to Nagle's algorithm in TCP. This setting gives the upper bound on the delay for batching.

| Maximum in flight requests a| Number |  Maximum number of unacknowledged requests the client sends on a single connection before blocking. If the value is greater than `1` and there are failed sends, there is a risk of message re-ordering due to retries (if retries are enabled). |  `5` |
| Maximum request size a| Number |  Maximum size of a request in bytes. This setting limits the number of record batches the producer sends in a single request to avoid sending huge requests. This is also effectively a cap on the maximum record batch size. Note that the server has its own cap on record batch size, which might be different from this. |  `1` |

| Retries amount a| Number |  Setting a value greater than `0` causes the client to resend any record whose send fails with a potentially transient error. Note that this retry is no different than if the client resent the record upon receiving the error. Allowing retries without setting `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` to `1` potentially changes the ordering of records because if two batches are sent to a single partition, and the first fails and is retried but the second succeeds, then the records in the second batch might appear first. Additionally, produce requests will be failed before the number of retries has been exhausted if the timeout configured by `delivery.timeout.ms` expires before successful acknowledgment. It is recommended that users leave this configuration unset and instead use `delivery.timeout.ms` to control retry behavior. |  `1` |

If the response is not received before the timeout elapses, the client resends the request if necessary or fails the request if retries are exhausted. This value must be larger than `replica.lag.time.max.ms` (a broker configuration) to reduce the possibility of message duplication due to unnecessary producer retries. |  `30` |

| TLS Configuration a| <<Tls>> |  Defines a TLS configuration, used by both clients and server sides to secure the communication for the Mule app. The connector automatically sets the `security.protocol` to use for the communication. The valid values are `PLAINTEXT`, `SSL`, `SASL_PLAINTEXT`, or `SASL_SSL`. If the broker configures `SSL` as the protocol, configure the keystore in the `tls:context` child element of the configuration and the connector will automatically use `SSL` (or `SASL_SSL` for SASL authentication) as the `security.protocol`. |  |
| Endpoint identification algorithm | String | Endpoint identification algorithm used by clients to validate the server hostname.

| Batch size a| Number |  Producer attempts to batch records together into fewer requests whenever multiple records are sent to the same partition. This helps performance on both the client and the server. This configuration controls the default batch size in bytes. No attempt is made to batch records larger than this size. Requests sent to brokers contain multiple batches, one for each partition with the data that is available to send. A small batch size makes batching less common and can reduce throughput (a batch size of `0` disables batching entirely). A very large batch size can result in more wasteful use of memory as a buffer of the specified batch size is always allocated in anticipation of additional records. |  `16` |

| Buffer size a| Number |  Total bytes of memory the producer uses to buffer records waiting to send to the server. If records are sent faster than they are delivered to the server, the producer blocks for `max.block.ms`, after which it throws an exception. This setting generally corresponds to the total memory the producer uses, but is not exact because the memory used by the producer is not all used for buffering. Some additional memory is used for compression (if compression is enabled), as well as for maintaining in-flight requests. The default value in the Apache Kafka documentation is `33554432` (32MB), but this should be capped to align with expected values for Mule instances in CloudHub (v0.1 core). |  `1` |

The producer might report failure to send a record earlier than this configuration if either an unrecoverable error is encountered, the retries have been exhausted, or the record is added to a batch that reached an earlier delivery expiration deadline.

If `false`, the producer retries due to broker failures and might write duplicates of the retried message in the stream. Enabling idempotence requires `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` to be less than or equal to `5`, retries to be greater than `0`. and acks to be `all`. If these values are not explicitly set by the user, suitable values are chosen. If incompatible values are set, a `ConnectionException` is thrown. |  `false` |

| Batch size a| Number |  Producer attempts to batch records together into fewer requests whenever multiple records are sent to the same partition. This helps performance on both the client and the server. This configuration controls the default batch size in bytes. No attempt is made to batch records larger than this size. Requests sent to brokers contain multiple batches, one for each partition with the data that is available to send. A small batch size makes batching less common and can reduce throughput (a batch size of `0` disables batching entirely). A very large batch size can result in more wasteful use of memory as a buffer of the specified batch size is always allocated in anticipation of additional records. |  `16` |

** BYTE

| Buffer size a| Number |  Total bytes of memory the producer uses to buffer records waiting to send to the server. If records are sent faster than they are delivered to the server, the producer blocks for `max.block.ms`, after which it throws an exception. This setting generally corresponds to the total memory the producer uses, but is not exact because the memory used by the producer is not all used for buffering. Some additional memory is used for compression (if compression is enabled), as well as for maintaining in-flight requests. The default value in the Apache Kafka documentation is `33554432` (32MB), but this should be capped to align with expected values for Mule instances in CloudHub (v0.1 core). |  `1` |

| Delivery Timeout a| Number |  Upper limit on the time to report success or failure after a call to `send()` returns. This limits the total time that a record is delayed prior to sending, the time to await acknowledgment from the broker (if expected), and the time allowed for retrying send failures. The producer might report failure to send a record earlier than this configuration if either an unrecoverable error is encountered, the retries have been exhausted, or the record is added to a batch that reached an earlier delivery expiration deadline. The value of this configuration must be greater than or equal to the sum of `request.timeout.ms` and `linger.ms`. | `120` |

| Enable idempotence a| Boolean |  When set to `true`, the producer ensures that exactly one copy of each message is written in the stream. If `false`, the producer retries due to broker failures and might write duplicates of the retried message in the stream. Enabling idempotence requires `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` to be less than or equal to `5`, retries to be greater than `0`. and acks to be `all`. If these values are not explicitly set by the user, suitable values are chosen. If incompatible values are set, a `ConnectionException` is thrown. |  `false` |
| Linger time  a| Number a| Producer groups together any records that arrive in between request transmissions into a single batched request. Normally this occurs only under load when records arrive faster than they are sent out. However, in some circumstances the client might want to reduce the number of requests, even under moderate load.
{sp} +
{sp} +
This setting accomplishes this by adding a small amount of artificial delay (rather than immediately sending out a record the producer waits for up to the given delay to allow other records to be sent so that the sends can be batched together). This is analogous to Nagle's algorithm in TCP. This setting gives the upper bound on the delay for batching.
{sp} +
{sp} +
After the specified `batch.size` worth of records is received for a partition, it is sent immediately regardless of this setting, however if fewer than the specified number of bytes accumulated for this partition is received, the producer "lingers" for the specified time waiting for more records to arrive.
{sp} +
{sp} +
This setting defaults to `0` (no delay). Setting `linger.ms=5`, for example, has the effect of reducing the number of requests sent but would add up to 5ms of latency to records sent in the absence of load. |  `0` |

| Maximum request size a| Number |  Maximum size of a request in bytes. This setting limits the number of record batches the producer sends in a single request to avoid sending huge requests. This is also effectively a cap on the maximum record batch size. Note that the server has its own cap on record batch size, which might be different from this. |  `1` |

** GB |  Unit of measure for the *Default receive buffer size* field. You can override this parameter at the source level. |  `KB` |
| Retries amount a| Number |  Setting a value greater than `0` causes the client to resend any record whose send fails with a potentially transient error. Note that this retry is no different than if the client resent the record upon receiving the error. Allowing retries without setting `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` to `1` potentially changes the ordering of records because if two batches are sent to a single partition, and the first fails and is retried but the second succeeds, then the records in the second batch might appear first. Additionally, produce requests will be failed before the number of retries has been exhausted if the timeout configured by `delivery.timeout.ms` expires before successful acknowledgment. It is recommended that users leave this configuration unset and instead use `delivery.timeout.ms` to control retry behavior. |  `1` |

| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Bootstrap Server URLs a| Array of String |  List of servers to bootstrap the connection with the Kafka cluster. This can be a partial list of the available servers. |  | x
| Batch size a| Number |  Producer attempts to batch records together into fewer requests whenever multiple records are sent to the same partition. This helps performance on both the client and the server. This configuration controls the default batch size in bytes. No attempt is made to batch records larger than this size. Requests sent to brokers contain multiple batches, one for each partition with the data that is available to send. A small batch size makes batching less common and can reduce throughput (a batch size of zero disables batching entirely). A very large batch size can result in more wasteful use of memory as a buffer of the specified batch size is always allocated in anticipation of additional records. |  `16` |
| The batch size unit of measure. a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB |  Unit of measure for the *Batch size* field. |  `KB` |
| Buffer size a| Number |  Total bytes of memory the producer uses to buffer records waiting to send to the server. If records are sent faster than they are delivered to the server, the producer blocks for `max.block.ms`, after which it throws an exception. This setting generally corresponds to the total memory the producer uses, but is not exact because the memory used by the producer is not all used for buffering. Some additional memory is used for compression (if compression is enabled), as well as for maintaining in-flight requests. The default value in the Apache Kafka documentation is `33554432` (32MB), but this should be capped to align with expected values for Mule instances in CloudHub (v0.1 core). |  `1` |
| The buffer memory size unit of measure. a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB |  Unit of measure for the *Buffer size* field. |  `KB` |
| DNS Lookups a| Enumeration, one of:

** DEFAULT
** USE_ALL_DNS_IPS
** RESOLVE_CANONICAL_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_ONLY |  Controls how the client uses DNS lookups. If set to USE_ALL_DNS_IPS then, when the lookup returns multiple IP addresses for a hostname, they attempt to connect before failing the connection. Applies to both bootstrap and advertised servers. If the value is RESOLVE_CANONICAL_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_ONLY each entry is resolved and expanded into a list of canonical names.

* `USE_ALL_DNS_IPS`
+
When the lookup returns multiple IP addresses for a hostname, a connection is attempted to all of the IP addresses before the connection fails. Applies to both bootstrap and advertised servers.

* `RESOLVE_CANONICAL_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_ONLY`
+
Each entry is resolved and expanded into a list of canonical names. | `USE_ALL_DNS_IPS` |
| Compression type a| Enumeration, one of:

** NONE
** GZIP
** SNAPPY
** LZ4
** ZSTD |  Compression type for all data generated by the producer. The default is `NONE` (no compression). Compression works on full batches of data, so the efficacy of batching also impacts the compression ratio. More batching means better compression. |  `NONE` |
| Connections maximum idle time a| Number | Close idle connections after the specified time is reached. |  `540` |
| Connections maximum idle time unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Time unit for the *Connections maximum idle time* field. | `SECONDS` |
| Delivery Timeout a| Number |  Upper limit on the time to report success or failure after a call to `send()` returns. This limits the total time that a record is delayed prior to sending, the time to await acknowledgment from the broker (if expected), and the time allowed for retrying send failures. The producer might report failure to send a record earlier than this configuration if either an unrecoverable error is encountered, the retries have been exhausted, or the record is added to a batch that reached an earlier delivery expiration deadline. The value of this configuration must be greater than or equal to the sum of `request.timeout.ms` and `linger.ms`. | `120` |
| Delivery Timeout Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Time unit for the *Delivery Timeout* field. |  `SECONDS` |
| Enable idempotence a| Boolean |  When set to `true`, the producer ensures that exactly one copy of each message is written in the stream. If `false`, the producer retries due to broker failures and might write duplicates of the retried message in the stream. Enabling idempotence requires `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` to be less than or equal to `5`, retries to be greater than `0`. and acks to be `all`. If these values are not explicitly set by the user, suitable values are chosen. If incompatible values are set, a `ConnectionException` is thrown. |  `false` |
| Linger time  a| Number a| Producer groups together any records that arrive in between request transmissions into a single batched request. Normally this occurs only under load when records arrive faster than they are sent out. However, in some circumstances the client might want to reduce the number of requests, even under moderate load.
{sp} +
{sp} +
This setting accomplishes this by adding a small amount of artificial delay (rather than immediately sending out a record the producer waits for up to the given delay to allow other records to be sent so that the sends can be batched together). This is analogous to Nagle's algorithm in TCP. This setting gives the upper bound on the delay for batching.
{sp} +
{sp} +
After the specified `batch.size` worth of records is received for a partition, it is sent immediately regardless of this setting, however if fewer than the specified number of bytes accumulated for this partition is received, the producer "lingers" for the specified time waiting for more records to arrive.
{sp} +
{sp} +
This setting defaults to `0` (no delay). Setting `linger.ms=5`, for example, has the effect of reducing the number of requests sent but would add up to 5ms of latency to records sent in the absence of load. |  `0` |
| Linger Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Time unit for the *Linger time* field. | `SECONDS` |
| Maximum block time  a| Number |  Controls for how long `KafkaProducer.send()` and `KafkaProducer.partitionsFor()` are blocked. These methods can be blocked either because the buffer is full or the metadata `unavailable.Blocking` in the user-supplied serializers or partitioner is not counted against this timeout. |  `60` |
| Maximum block time unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Time unit for the *Maximum block time* field. |  `SECONDS` |
| Maximum in flight requests a| Number |  Maximum number of unacknowledged requests the client sends on a single connection before blocking. If the value is greater than `1` and there are failed sends, there is a risk of message re-ordering due to retries (if retries are enabled). |  `5` |
| Maximum request size a| Number |  Maximum size of a request in bytes. This setting limits the number of record batches the producer sends in a single request to avoid sending huge requests. This is also effectively a cap on the maximum record batch size. Note that the server has its own cap on record batch size, which might be different from this. |  `1` |
| Maximum request size unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB |  Unit of measure for the *Maximum request size* field. |  `MB` |
| Producer Acknowledge Mode a| Enumeration, one of:

** NONE
** LEADER_ONLY
** ALL |  Number of acknowledgments the producer requires the leader to receive before considering a request complete. This controls the durability of records that are sent. |  `NONE` |
| Default receive buffer size a| Number |  Size of the TCP receive buffer (SO_RCVBUF) to use when reading data. If the value is `-1`, the OS default is used. You can override this parameter at the source level. |  `64` |
| Default receive buffer size unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB |  Unit of measure for the *Default receive buffer size* field. You can override this parameter at the source level. |  `KB` |
| Retries amount a| Number |  Setting a value greater than `0` causes the client to resend any record whose send fails with a potentially transient error. Note that this retry is no different than if the client resent the record upon receiving the error. Allowing retries without setting `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` to `1` potentially changes the ordering of records because if two batches are sent to a single partition, and the first fails and is retried but the second succeeds, then the records in the second batch might appear first. Additionally, produce requests will be failed before the number of retries has been exhausted if the timeout configured by `delivery.timeout.ms` expires before successful acknowledgment. It is recommended that users leave this configuration unset and instead use `delivery.timeout.ms` to control retry behavior. |  `1` |
| Retry Backoff Timeout a| Number |  Amount of time to wait before attempting to retry a failed request to a given topic partition. This avoids repeatedly sending requests in a tight loop under some failure scenarios. |  `100` |
| Retry Backoff Timeout Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Time unit for the *Retry Backoff Timeout* field. |  `MILLISECONDS` |
| Default send buffer size a| Number |  Size of the TCP send buffer (SO_SNDBUF) to use when sending data. If the value is `-1`, the OS default is used. You can override this parameter at the source level. | `128` |
| Default send buffer size unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB |  Unit of measure for the *Default send buffer size* field. You can override this parameter at the source level. | `KB` |
| Default request timeout a| Number |  Maximum amount of time the client waits for the response to a request. If the response is not received before the timeout elapses, the client resends the request if necessary or fails the request if retries are exhausted. This value must be larger than `replica.lag.time.max.ms` (a broker configuration) to reduce the possibility of message duplication due to unnecessary producer retries. |  `30` |
| Default request timeout time unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Time unit for the *Default request timeout* field. |  `SECONDS` |
| Partitioner a| Enumeration, one of:

** DEFAULT
** ROUND_ROBIN
** UNIFORM_STICKY |  Controls the partitioning strategy. |  `DEFAULT` |
| Additional Properties a| Object |  Additional properties used to customize the Kafka connection. |  | 
| TLS Configuration a| <<Tls>> |  Defines a TLS configuration, used by both clients and server sides to secure the communication for the Mule app. The connector automatically sets the `security.protocol` to use for the communication. The valid values are `PLAINTEXT`, `SSL`, `SASL_PLAINTEXT`, or `SASL_SSL`. If the broker configures `SSL` as the protocol, configure the keystore in the `tls:context` child element of the configuration and the connector will automatically use `SSL` (or `SASL_SSL` for SASL authentication) as the `security.protocol`. |  |
| Endpoint identification algorithm | String | Endpoint identification algorithm used by clients to validate the server hostname. The default value is an empty string, which means the endpoint identification algorithm is disabled. Clients, including client connections created by the broker for inter-broker communication, verify that the broker host name matches the host name in the brokers certificate. | |
| Token ID a| String |  ID of the token. |  | x
| Token HMAC a| String |  Token HMAC. |  | x
| Encryption type a| Enumeration, one of:

** SCRAM_SHA_256
** SCRAM_SHA_512 |  Encryption algorithm used by SCRAM. |  | x
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  Configures a reconnection strategy to use when a connector operation fails to connect to an external server. |  |

* `true`
+
Allow the deployment to fail.

* `false`
+
Ignore the results of the connectivity test. |  |
| Reconnection Strategy a| * <<Reconnect>>
* <<Reconnect-Forever>> | Reconnection strategy to use. |  |

Type for records.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Attributes a| <<KafkaRecordAttributes>> | Kafka record attributes. |  |
| Payload a| Binary | Payload for the record. |  |
|===

[[RedeliveryPolicy]]
=== Redelivery Policy

Configures the redelivery policy for executing requests that generate errors. You can add a redelivery policy to any source in a flow.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Redelivery Count a| Number | Maximum number of times that a redelivered request can be processed unsuccessfully before returning a REDELIVERY_EXHAUSTED error. |  |
| Use Secure Hash a| Boolean | If `true`, Mule uses a secure hash algorithm to identify a redelivered message. |  |
| Message Digest Algorithm a| String | Secure hashing algorithm to use if the *Use Secure Hash* field is `true`. If the payload of the message is a Java object, Mule ignores this value and returns the value that the payload's `hashCode()` returned. |  |
| Id Expression a| String | Defines one or more expressions to use to determine when a message has been redelivered. This property may only be set if *Use Secure Hash* is `false`. |  |
| Object Store a| ObjectStore | Configures the object store that stores the redelivery counter for each message. |  |
|===

[[RepeatableFileStoreStream]]
=== Repeatable File Store Stream

Configures the repeatable file-store streaming strategy by which Mule keeps a portion of the stream content in memory. If the stream content is larger than the configured buffer size, Mule backs up the buffer's content to disk and then clears the memory.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| In Memory Size a| Number a| Maximum amount of memory that the stream can use for data. If the amount of memory exceeds this value, Mule buffers the content to disk. To optimize performance:

* Configure a larger buffer size to avoid the number of times Mule needs to write the buffer on disk. This increases performance, but it also limits the number of concurrent requests your application can process, because it requires additional memory.

* Configure a smaller buffer size to decrease memory load at the expense of response time. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | Unit for the *In Memory Size* field. |  |
|===

[[RepeatableInMemoryStream]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Stream

Configures the in-memory streaming strategy by which the request fails if the data exceeds the MAX buffer size. Always run performance tests to find the optimal buffer size for your specific use case.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | Initial amount of memory to allocate to the data stream. If the streamed data exceeds this value, the buffer expands by *Buffer Size Increment*, with an upper limit of *Max In Memory Size value*. |  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | Amount by which the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of `0` or lower specifies that the buffer can't expand. |  |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | Maximum amount of memory to use. If more than that is used then a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised. A value lower than or equal to zero means no limit. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | Unit for the *Initial Buffer Size*, *Buffer Size Increment*, and *Buffer Unit* fields. |  |
|===

[[StandardRevocationCheck]]
=== Standard Revocation Check

Configures standard revocation checks for TLS certificates.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Only End Entities a| Boolean a| Which elements to verify in the certificate chain:

* `true`
+
Verify only the last element in the certificate chain.

* `false`
+
Verify all elements in the certificate chain. |  |
| Prefer Crls a| Boolean a| How to check certificate validity:

* `true`
+
Check the Certification Revocation List (CRL) for certificate validity.

* `false`
+
Use the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) to check certificate validity. |  |
| No Fallback a| Boolean a| Whether to use the secondary method to check certificate validity:

* `true`
+
Use the method that wasn't specified in the *Prefer Crls* field (the secondary method) to check certificate validity.

* `false`
+
Do not use the secondary method to check certificate validity. |  |
| Soft Fail a| Boolean a| What to do if the revocation server can't be reached or is busy:

* `true`
+
Avoid verification failure.

* `false`
+
Allow the verification to fail. |  |

[[TcpClientSocketParams]]
=== Tcp Client Socket Params

Configures the TCP client socket parameters.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Send Buffer Size a| Number | Size of the buffer (in bytes) used when sending data, set on the socket itself. |  | 
| Receive Buffer Size a| Number | Buffer size. |  | 
| Client Timeout a| Number | Sets the `SO_TIMEOUT` value on sockets. Indicates the amount of time (in milliseconds) that the socket waits in a blocking operation before failing. A value of 0 (the default) means waiting indefinitely. | `0` | 
| Send Tcp No Delay a| Boolean | If set, transmitted data is not collected together for greater efficiency but sent immediately. Defaults to true even though Socket default is false because optimizing to reduce amount of network traffic over latency is hardly ever a concern today. | `true` | 
| Linger a| Number | Sets the `SO_LINGER` value. This is related to how long (in milliseconds) the socket takes to close so that any remaining data is transmitted correctly. |  | 
| Keep Alive a| Boolean | Enables `SO_KEEPALIVE` behavior on open sockets. This automatically checks socket connections that are open but unused for long periods and closes them if the connection becomes unavailable. This is a property on the socket itself and is used by a server socket to control whether connections to the server are kept alive before they are recycled. | `false` | 
| Connection Timeout a| Number | How long the connector waits before timing out when establishing a connection to the remote service.| 30000 | 
|===

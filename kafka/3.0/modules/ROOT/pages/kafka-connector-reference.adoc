== Types

=== Reconnection

Configures a reconnection strategy for an operation.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Fails Deployment a| Boolean a| What to do if, when an app is deployed, a connectivity test does not pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy:

* `true`
+
Allow the deployment to fail.

* `false`
+
Ignore the results of the connectivity test. |  |
| Reconnection Strategy a| * <<reconnect>>
* <<reconnect-forever>> | Reconnection strategy to use. |  |
|===

[[reconnect]]
=== Reconnect

Configures a standard reconnection strategy, which specifies how often to reconnect and how many reconnection attempts the connector source or operation can make.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Frequency a| Number | How often to attempt to reconnect, in milliseconds. |  |
| Count a| Number | How many reconnection attempts the Mule app can make. |  |
|===

[[reconnect-forever]]
=== Reconnect Forever

Configures a forever reconnection strategy by which the connector source or operation attempts to reconnect at a specified frequency for as long as the Mule app runs.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Frequency a| Number | How often to attempt to reconnect, in milliseconds. |  |
|===

[[ExpirationPolicy]]
=== Expiration Policy

Configures an expiration policy strategy.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Idle Time a| Number | Configures the maximum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before Mule considers it eligible for expiration. |  |
| Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS | Time unit for the *Max Idle Time* field. |  |
|===

[[Offset]]
=== Offset

Configures the offset type.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Partition Number a| String | Partition number. |  |
| Partition Offset a| String | Partition offset. |  |
|===

[[repeatable-in-memory-stream]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Stream

Configures the in-memory streaming strategy by which the request fails if the data exceeds the MAX buffer size. Always run performance tests to find the optimal buffer size for your specific use case.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | Initial amount of memory to allocate to the data stream. If the streamed data exceeds this value, the buffer expands by *Buffer Size Increment*, with an upper limit of *Max In Memory Size value*. |  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This is by how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer should not expand, meaning that a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error is raised when the buffer gets full. |  |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | Maximum size of the buffer. If the buffer size exceeds this value, Mule raises a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error. A value of less than or equal to `0` means no limit. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | Unit for the *Initial Buffer Size*, *Buffer Size Increment*, and *Buffer Unit* fields. |  |
|===

[[repeatable-file-store-stream]]
=== Repeatable File Store Stream

Configures the repeatable file-store streaming strategy by which Mule keeps a portion of the stream content in memory. If the stream content is larger than the configured buffer size, Mule backs up the buffer's content to disk and then clears the memory.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max In Memory Size a| Number a| Maximum amount of memory that the stream can use for data. If the amount of memory exceeds this value, Mule buffers the content to disk. To optimize performance:

* Configure a larger buffer size to avoid the number of times Mule needs to write the buffer on disk. This increases performance, but it also limits the number of concurrent requests your application can process, because it requires additional memory.

* Configure a smaller buffer size to decrease memory load at the expense of response time. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | Unit for the *In Memory Size* field. |  |
|===

[[RedeliveryPolicy]]
=== Redelivery Policy

Configures the redelivery policy for executing requests that generate errors. You can add a redelivery policy to any source in a flow.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Redelivery Count a| Number | Maximum number of times that a redelivered request can be processed unsuccessfully before returning a `REDELIVERY_EXHAUSTED` error. |  |
| Use Secure Hash a| Boolean | If `true`, Mule uses a secure hash algorithm to identify a redelivered message. |  |
| Message Digest Algorithm a| String | Secure hashing algorithm to use if the *Use Secure Hash* field is `true`. If the payload of the message is a Java object, Mule ignores this value and returns the value that the payload's `hashCode()` returned. |  |
| Id Expression a| String | One or more expressions that determine when a message was redelivered. You can set this property only if the *Use Secure Hash* field is `false`. |  |
| Object Store a| Object Store | Configures the object store that stores the redelivery counter for each message. |  |

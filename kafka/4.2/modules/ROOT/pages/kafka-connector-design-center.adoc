= Use Flow Designer to Configure Apache Kafka Connector v4.2 - Mule 4

Design Center enables you to create apps visually. To use Design Center, work with your Anypoint Platform administrator to ensure that you have a xref:access-management::environments.adoc#to-create-a-new-environment[Design environment]. For more information, see the xref:design-center::fd-tour.adoc[Flow Designer Tour].

To create an app in Design Center:

* Configure the input source (trigger) for your app.
* Add the connector as a component to process the input for the app.

For information on field values, see the xref:kafka-connector-reference.adoc[Apache Kafka Connector Reference].

== Configure the Trigger

. In Design Center, click *Create new*.
. Click *Create new application*.
. Enter a *Project name*, and select the *Target Environment*.
. Click *Create*.
. Click *Go straight to canvas* to exit from *Let's get started*.
. Click the name of the trigger card.
. If you are using the Anypoint Connector for Apache Kafka (Apache Kafka Connector) as a trigger, search for the connector; otherwise, search for `HTTP Listener` or `Scheduler`.
. Select the source. +
Apache Kafka Connector provides *Batch message listener* and *Message listener* as sources.
. To configure *Consumer*, set the field values:

[%header,cols="20s,20a,35a,20a,5a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x
| Default Acknowledgment Mode a| Enumeration, one of:

** AUTO
** MANUAL
** IMMEDIATE
** DUPS_OK a|  Defines the way that the Kafka broker instance is notified of message consumption.

* AUTO: Messages are committed only if the flow finishes successfully.
* MANUAL: The user must commit manually through the Commit operation.
* IMMEDIATE: Mule automatically commits the messages upon reception and before triggering the flow.
* DUPS_OK: Same as the MANUAL mode, but the commit is made asynchronously, which can lead to duplicate records. | `AUTO` |
| Default Listener Poll Timeout a| Number |  The time, in time units, to wait to perform a poll if data is not available in the buffer (fetched). If no value is set, the poll is returned immediately with any records that are currently available in the buffer or else returns empty if there is no data. Must not be negative. |  `100` |
| Default Listener Poll Timeout Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  The time unit for the polling timeout. This combines with pollTimeout to define the total timeout for the polling. |  `MILLISECONDS` |
| Default Listener Poll Timeout a| Number |  The time, in time units, to wait for an operation to finish. If no value is set or a negative value is set, the operation waits forever. | `-1` |
| Default Operation Timeout Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  The time unit for the operation timeout. This combines with operationTimeout to define the total default timeout for the operations that use this configuration. |  SECONDS |
| Zone ID a| String |  Converts the provided timestamps into `ZonedLocalDateTimes` in the results. Default value is the one provided by the system. |  |

=== Kafka Consumer Plaintext Connection

Add a connection configuration:

. Click *Add Connection*.
. Enter a unique *Connection Name*.
. Optionally, select *Share this connection with my business group*.
. Select the *Connection Type*, and enter the values for the connection:
+
[%header,cols="20s,20a,35a,20a,5a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Bootstrap Server URLs a| Array of String |  The list of servers to use to bootstrap the connection with the Apache Kafka cluster. This can be a partial list of the available servers. |  | x
| Group ID a| String |  Default group ID for all the Kafka consumers that use this configuration. |  |
| Consumer Amount a| Number | Determines the number of consumers the connection will initially create.  |  `1` |
| Maximum Polling Interval a| Number |  Controls the maximum amount of time the client will wait for the response of a request. If the response is not received before the timeout elapses the client resends the request; or the request fails if the specified number of retries are exhausted. This parameter can be overridden at the source level. |  `300` |
| Maximum Polling Interval Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Determines the time unit for request timeout scalar. This parameter can be overridden at source level. |  SECONDS |
| Isolation Level a| Enumeration, one of:

** READ_UNCOMMITTED
** READ_COMMITTED a| Controls how to read messages that are written transactionally.

If set to `read_committed`, `consumer.poll()` will return only transactional messages that have been committed. If set to `read_uncommitted`' (default), `consumer.poll()` returns all messages, even transactional messages that were aborted. Non-transactional messages are returned unconditionally in either mode. Messages are always returned in offset order. Hence, in `read_committed` mode, `consumer.poll()` returns only messages up to the last stable offset (LSO), which is the one less than the offset of the first open transaction.

In particular, any messages appearing after messages belonging to ongoing transactions are withheld until the relevant transaction is completed. As a result, `read_committed` consumers are not able to read up to the high watermark when there are in-flight transactions. Further, when in `read_committed` the `seekToEnd` method returns the LSO. |  `READ_UNCOMMITTED` |
| Exclude Internal Topics a| Boolean |  Whether internal topics matching a subscribed pattern should be excluded from the subscription. It is always possible to explicitly subscribe to an internal topic. |  `true` |
| Auto Offset Reset a| Enumeration, one of:

** EARLIEST
** LATEST
** ERROR a| Determines what to do when there is no initial offset in Apache Kafka or if the current offset no longer exists on the server (for example, because the data was deleted):

* EARLIEST: Automatically reset the offset to the earliest offset.
* LATEST: Automatically reset the offset to the latest offset.
* ERROR: Throw an error if no previous offset is found for the consumer's group. | `LATEST` |
| Retry Backoff Timeout a| Number |  The amount of time to wait before attempting to retry a failed request to a given topic partition. This avoids repeatedly sending requests in a tight loop under some failure scenarios. |  `100` |
| Retry Backoff Timeout Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Determines the time unit for the reconnect backoff timeout scalar. |  `MILLISECONDS` |
| Check CRC a| Boolean |  Automatically check the CRC32 of the records consumed. This ensures that no on-the-wire or on-disk corruption to the messages occurred. This check adds some overhead, so in cases seeking extreme performance, this can be disabled. |  `true` |
| Default Receive Buffer Size a| Number |  The size of the TCP receive buffer (SO_RCVBUF) to use when reading data. If the value is `-1`, the OS default is used. This parameter can be overridden at the source level. | `64` |
| Default Receive Buffer Size Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB |  The unit of measure for the receive buffer size scalar. This parameter can be overridden at the source level. | `KB` |
| Default Send Buffer Size a| Number |  The size of the TCP send buffer (SO_SNDBUF) to use when sending data. If the value is `-1`, the OS default is used. This parameter can be overridden at the source level. | `128` |
| Default Send Buffer Size Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB |  The unit of measure for the send buffer size scalar. This parameter can be overridden at the source level. | `KB` |
| Request Timeout a| Number |  The configuration controls the maximum amount of time the client will wait for the response of a request. If the response is not received before the timeout elapses the client resends the request if necessary or fails the request if the retries are exhausted. This parameter can be overridden at the source level. |  `30` |
| Request Timeout Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Determines the time unit for request timeout scalar. This parameter can be overridden at the source level. | `SECONDS` |
| Default Record Limit a| Number |  The maximum number of records returned on a poll call to the Apache Kafka cluster. You can override this parameter at the source level. |  `500` |
| DNS Lookups a| Enumeration, one of:

** DEFAULT
** USE_ALL_DNS_IPS
** RESOLVE_CANONICAL_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_ONLY |  Controls how the client uses DNS lookups. If set to `use_all_dns_ips` then, when the lookup returns multiple IP addresses for a hostname, a connection is attempted to all of the IP addresses before the connection fails. Applies to both bootstrap and advertised servers. If the value is `resolve_canonical_bootstrap_servers_only` each entry is resolved and expanded into a list of canonical names. | `DEFAULT` |
| Heartbeat Interval a| Number |  The expected time between heartbeats to the consumer coordinator when using Apache Kafka's group management facilities. Heartbeats are used to ensure that the consumer's session stays active and to facilitate rebalancing when new consumers join or leave the group. The value must be set lower than `session.timeout.ms`, but typically no higher than 1/3 of that value. You can adjust it to be even lower to control the expected time for normal rebalances. | `3` |
| Heartbeat Interval Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Determines the time unit for fetching the heartbeat interval time scalar. |  `SECONDS` |
| Session Timeout a| Number |  The timeout used to detect consumer failures when using Apache Kafka's group management facility. The consumer sends periodic heartbeats to confirm to the broker that it is still alive. If no heartbeats are received by the broker before the expiration of this session timeout, then the broker removes this consumer from the group and initiates a rebalance. The value must be in the allowable range as configured in the broker configuration by `group.min.session.timeout.ms` and `group.max.session.timeout.ms`. |  `10` |
| Session Timeout Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Determines the time unit for session timeout scalar. |  `SECONDS` |
| Connection Maximum Idle Time a| Number |  Close idle connections after the number of milliseconds specified by this configuration. |  `540` |
| Connection Maximum Idle Time Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Determines the time unit for connections maximum idle time scalar. |  `SECONDS` |

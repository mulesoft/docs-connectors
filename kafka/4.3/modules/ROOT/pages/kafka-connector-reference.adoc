==== Connection Types

[[consumer-plaintext]]
===== Consumer Plaintext Connection

====== Parameters
[%header,cols="20s,20a,35a,20a,5a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Bootstrap Server URLs a| Array of String |  The list of servers to bootstrap the connection with the Kafka cluster. This can be a partial list of the available servers. |  | x
| Group ID a| String |  Default group ID for all the Kafka consumers that use this configuration. |  |
| Consumer Amount a| Number | Determines the number of consumers the connection will initially create.  |  `1` |
| Maximum polling interval a| Number |  Controls the maximum amount of time the client waits for the response of a request. If the response is not received before the timeout elapses, the client resends the request, or the request fails if the specified number of retries are exhausted. You can override this parameter at the source level. |  `300` |
| Maximum Polling Interval Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Determines the time unit for request timeout scalar. You can override this parameter at the source level. |  `SECONDS` |
| Isolation Level a| Enumeration, one of:

** READ_UNCOMMITTED
** READ_COMMITTED a| Controls how to read messages that are written transactionally.

If set to `READ_COMMITTED`, `consumer.poll()` only transactional messages that have been committed are returned. If set to `READ_UNCOMMITTED` (default), `consumer.poll()` all messages are returned, even transactional messages that were aborted. Non-transactional messages are returned unconditionally in either mode. Messages are always returned in offset order. Hence, in `READ_COMMITTED` mode, `consumer.poll()` returns only messages up to the last stable offset (LSO), which is one less than the offset of the first open transaction.

In particular, any messages appearing after messages belonging to ongoing transactions are withheld until the relevant transaction is completed. As a result, `read_committed` consumers are not able to read up to the high watermark when there are in-flight transactions. Furthermore, when in `read_committed` the `seekToEnd` method returns the LSO. |  `READ_UNCOMMITTED` |
| Exclude internal topics a| Boolean |  Whether internal topics matching a subscribed pattern should be excluded from the subscription. It is always possible to explicitly subscribe to an internal topic. |  `true` |
| Auto offset reset a| Enumeration, one of:

** EARLIEST
** LATEST
** ERROR a| Determines what to do when there is no initial offset in Kafka or if the current offset no longer exists on the server (for example, because the data was deleted):

* EARLIEST: Automatically reset the offset to the earliest offset.
* LATEST: Automatically reset the offset to the latest offset.
* ERROR: Throw an error if no previous offset is found for the consumer's group. | `LATEST` |
| Retry Backoff Timeout a| Number |  The amount of time to wait before attempting to retry a failed request to a given topic partition. This avoids repeatedly sending requests in a tight loop under some failure scenarios. |  `100` |
| Retry Backoff Timeout Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Determines the time unit for the reconnect backoff timeout scalar. |  `MILLISECONDS` |
| Check CRC a| Boolean |  Automatically check the CRC32 of the records consumed. This ensures that no on-the-wire or on-disk corruption to the messages occurred. This check adds some overhead, so in situations that require extremely high performance, this can be disabled. |  `true` |
| Default receive buffer size a| Number |  The size of the TCP receive buffer (SO_RCVBUF) to use when reading data. If the value is `-1`, the OS default is used. You can override this parameter at the source level. | `64` |
| Default receive buffer size unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB |  The unit of measure for the receive buffer size scalar. You can override this parameter at the source level. | `KB` |
| Default send buffer size a| Number |  The size of the TCP send buffer (SO_SNDBUF) to use when sending data. If the value is `-1`, the OS default is used. You can override this parameter at the source level. | `128` |
| Default send buffer size unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB |  The unit of measure for the send buffer size scalar. You can override this parameter at the source level. | `KB` |
| Request Timeout a| Number |  The configuration controls the maximum amount of time the client will wait for the response of a request. If the response is not received before the timeout elapses, the client resends the request if necessary, or fails the request if the retries are exhausted. You can override this parameter at the source level. |  `30` |
| Request Timeout Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Determines the time unit for request timeout scalar. You can override this parameter at the source level. | `SECONDS` |
| Default record limit a| Number |  The maximum number of records returned on a poll call to the Kafka cluster. You can override this parameter at the source level. |  `500` |
| DNS Lookups a| Enumeration, one of:

** DEFAULT
** USE_ALL_DNS_IPS
** RESOLVE_CANONICAL_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_ONLY |  Controls how the client uses DNS lookups.

* If set to `use_all_dns_ips` then, when the lookup returns multiple IP addresses for a hostname, a connection is attempted to all of the IP addresses before the connection fails. Applies to both bootstrap and advertised servers.
* If set to `resolve_canonical_bootstrap_servers_only` each entry is resolved and expanded into a list of canonical names. | `DEFAULT` |

| Heartbeat interval a| Number |  The expected time between heartbeats to the consumer coordinator when using Apache Kafka's group management facilities. Heartbeats are used to ensure that the consumer's session stays active and to facilitate rebalancing when new consumers join or leave the group. The value must be set lower than `session.timeout.ms`, but typically should be set no higher than 1/3 of that value. It can be adjusted even lower to control the expected time for normal rebalances. | `3` |
| Heartbeat Interval Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Determines the time unit for fetching the heartbeat interval time scalar |  `SECONDS` |
| Session Timeout a| Number |  The timeout used to detect consumer failures when using Apache Kafka's group management facility. The consumer sends periodic heartbeats to indicate its aliveness to the broker. If no heartbeats are received by the broker before the expiration of this session timeout, then the broker removes this consumer from the group and initiates a rebalance. The value must be in the allowable range as configured in the broker configuration by `group.min.session.timeout.ms` and `group.max.session.timeout.ms`. |  `10` |
| Session timeout time unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Determines the time unit for session timeout scalar |  `SECONDS` |
| Connection maximum idle time a| Number |  Close idle connections after the number of milliseconds specified by this configuration |  `540` |
| Connection maximum idle time time unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  The time unit for the connection's maximum idle time scalar |  `SECONDS` |
| TLS Configuration a| <<Tls>> | Defines a TLS configuration used by both clients and server sides to secure the communication for the Mule app. The connector automatically sets the `security.protocol` to use for the communication. The valid values are `PLAINTEXT`, `SSL`, `SASL_PLAINTEXT` or `SASL_SSL`. The default value is `PLAINTEXT` or `SASL_PLAINTEXT` for SASL authentication - kerberos/scram/plain. If the broker configures `SSL` as the protocol then configure at least the keystore in the `tls:context` child element of the configuration and the connector will automatically use `SSL` (or `SASL_SSL` for SASL authentication) as the `security.protocol`. | |
| Endpoint identification algorithm | String | The endpoint identification algorithm used by clients to validate the server hostname. The default value is an empty string, which means the endpoint identification algorithm is disabled. Clients, including client connections created by the broker for inter-broker communication, verify that the broker host name matches the host name in the brokers certificate. | |
| Topic Subscription Patterns a| Array of String |  The list of subscription regular expressions to subscribe to. Topics are automatically rebalanced between the amount of consumers of the topic. |  |
| Assignments a| Array of <<TopicPartition>> |  The list of topic-partition pairs to assign. Consumers are not automatically rebalanced.  |  |
| Default fetch minimum size a| Number |  The minimum amount of data the server should return for a fetch request. If insufficient data is available, the request waits for the specified minimum amount of data to accumulate before answering the request. The default setting of 1 byte means that fetch requests are answered as soon as a single byte of data is available or the fetch request times out waiting for data to arrive. If you set this to a value greater than 1, the server waits for larger amounts of data to accumulate, which can improve server throughput slightly at the cost of some additional latency. You can override this parameter at the source level. |  `1` |
| Fetch Minimum Size Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit of measure for the minimum default fetch minimum size scalar. You can override this parameter at the source level. | `BYTE` |
| Default fetch maximum size a| Number |  The maximum amount of data the server should return for a fetch request. Records are fetched in batches by the consumer. If the first record batch in the first non-empty partition of the fetch is larger than this value, the record batch is still returned to ensure that the consumer can make progress. As such, this is not an absolute maximum. The maximum record batch size accepted by the broker is defined using `message.max.bytes` (broker configuration) or `max.message.bytes` (topic configuration). The consumer performs multiple fetches in parallel. You can override this parameter at the source level. |  `1` |
| Default maximum fetch size unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB |  The unit of measure for the default fetch size maximum size scalar. You can override this parameter at the source level. |  `MB` |
| Default maximum partition fetch size a| Number |  The maximum amount of data per partition that the server returns. The consumer fetches records in batches. If the first record batch in the first non-empty partition of the fetch is larger than this limit, the batch is still returned to ensure that the consumer can make progress. The maximum record batch size accepted by the broker is defined using `message.max.bytes` (broker configuration) or `max.message.bytes` (topic configuration). See `fetch.max.bytes` for limiting the consumer request size. You can override this parameter at the source level. |  1 |
| Default maximum partition fetch unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB |  The unit of measure for the maximum partition fetch size scalar. You can override this parameter at the source level. |  `MB` |
| Fetch Maximum Wait Timeout a| Number |  The maximum amount of time the server blocks before answering the fetch request if there isn't sufficient data to immediately satisfy the requirement specified by `fetch.min.bytes`. |  `500` |
| Fetch Maximum Wait Timeout Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  The time unit for the fetch maximum wait timeout scalar |  MILLISECONDS |
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to `true`, deployment fails if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy. |  |

| Kerberos configuration file (krb5.conf) a| String |  The path to the `krb5.conf` file, which contains Kerberos configuration information. This information includes the locations of KDCs and admin servers for the Kerberos realms of interest, defaults for the current realm, defaults for Kerberos applications, and the mappings of hostnames to Kerberos realms. |  |
| Use ticket cache a| Boolean |  Set this option to `true` to obtain the ticket-granting ticket (TGT) from the ticket cache. Set this option to `false` if you do not want to use the ticket cache. The connector searches for the ticket cache as follows:

* On Solaris and Linux, the connector looks in `/tmp/krb5cc_uid`, where the `uid` is the numeric user identifier.
* If the ticket cache is not available in `/tmp/krb5cc_uid` or the app is on a Windows platform, the connector looks in `{user.home}{file.separator}krb5cc_{user.name}`.
You can override the ticket cache location by setting a value for the `Ticket cache` parameter.

In a Windows environment, if a ticket cannot be retrieved from the file ticket cache, Windows uses the Local Security Authority (LSA) API to get the ticket-granting ticket (TGT). |  false |
| Ticket cache a| String |  The name of the ticket cache that contains the user's ticket-granting ticket (TGT). If this value is set, `Use ticket cache` must also be set to true. Otherwise, a configuration error is returned. |  |
| Use keytab a| Boolean |  Set this option to `true` if you want the connector to obtain the principal's key from the keytab. If you don't set this value, the connector locates the keytab by using the Kerberos configuration file. If the keytab is not specified in the Kerberos configuration file, the connector looks for the `{user.home}{file.separator}krb5.keytab` file. |  false |
| Keytab a| String |  Set this option to the file name of the keytab to obtain the principal's secret key. |  |
| Store key a| Boolean |  Set option this to `true` to store the principal's in the subject's private credentials. |  false |
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to true, deployment fails if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy. |  |

As a result, `READ_COMMITTED` consumers are not able to read up to the high watermark when there are in-flight transactions. When the isolation level is set to `READ_COMMITTED`, the `seekToEnd` method returns the LSO. |  `READ_UNCOMMITTED` |
| Exclude internal topics a| Boolean |  Whether internal topics that match a subscribed pattern should be excluded from the subscription. It is always possible to explicitly subscribe to an internal topic. |  `true` |

The default setting of 1 byte means that fetch requests are answered as soon as a single byte of data is available, unless the fetch request times out waiting for data to arrive.
{sp} +

** BYTE
** KB

| Bootstrap server URLs a| Array of String |  The list of servers to bootstrap the connection with the Kafka cluster. This can be a partial list of the available servers. |  | x
| Batch size a| Number |  The producer attempts to batch records together into fewer requests whenever multiple records are sent to the same partition. This helps performance on both the client and the server. This configuration controls the default batch size in bytes. No attempt is made to batch records larger than this size. Requests sent to brokers will contain multiple batches, one for each partition with the data that is available to send. A small batch size makes batching less common and can reduce throughput (a batch size of zero disables batching entirely). A very large batch size can result in more wasteful use of memory as a buffer of the specified batch size is always allocated in anticipation of additional records. |  `16` |
| The batch size unit of measure. a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB |  The unit of measure for the batch size scalar. |  `KB` |
| Buffer size a| Number |  The total bytes of memory the producer can use to buffer records waiting to be sent to the server. If records are sent faster than they can be delivered to the server, the producer blocks for `max.block.ms`, after which it throws an exception. This setting should generally correspond to the total memory the producer will use, but is not exact because the memory used by the producer is not all used for buffering. Some additional memory is used for compression (if compression is enabled), as well as for maintaining in-flight requests. The default value in the Apache Kafka documentation is `33554432` (32MB), but this should be capped to align with expected values for Mule instances in CloudHub (v0.1 core). |  1 |
| The buffer memory size unit of measure. a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB |  The unit of measure for the max request size scalar. |  `KB` |
| DNS lookups a| Enumeration, one of:

** DEFAULT
** USE_ALL_DNS_IPS
** RESOLVE_CANONICAL_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_ONLY |  Controls how the client uses DNS lookups. If set to `use_all_dns_ips` then, when the lookup returns multiple IP addresses for a hostname, the connection is attempted on all of the IP addresses before failing the connection. Applies to both bootstrap and advertised servers. If the value is `resolve_canonical_bootstrap_servers_only`, each entry is resolved and expanded into a list of canonical names. |  `DEFAULT` |
| Compression type a| Enumeration, one of:

** NONE
** GZIP
** SNAPPY
** LZ4
** ZSTD |  The compression type for all data generated by the producer. The default is none (no compression). Valid values are none, gzip, snappy, lz4, or zstd. Compression is performed on full batches of data, so the efficacy of batching also impacts the compression ratio (more batching means better compression). |  `NONE` |
| Connections maximum idle time a| Number | Close idle connections after the specified time is reached. |  `540` |
| Connections maximum idle time unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Determines the time unit for the connection's maximum idle scalar. | `SECONDS` |
| Delivery Timeout a| Number |  An upper limit on the time to report success or failure after a call to `send()` returns. This limits the total time that a record will be delayed prior to sending, the time to await acknowledgment from the broker (if expected), and the time allowed for retrying send failures. The producer might report failure to send a record earlier than this configuration if either an unrecoverable error is encountered, the retries have been exhausted, or the record is added to a batch that reached an earlier delivery expiration deadline. The value of this configuration should be greater than or equal to the sum of `request.timeout.ms` and `linger.ms`. | `120` |
| Delivery Timeout Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Determines the time unit for the delivery timeout scalar. |  SECONDS |
| Enable idempotence a| Boolean |  When set to `true`, the producer will ensure that exactly one copy of each message is written in the stream. If `false`, the producer retries due to broker failures, and so on, and may write duplicates of the retried message in the stream. Enabling idempotence requires `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` to be less than or equal to `5`, retries to be greater than `0` and acks must be `all`. If these values are not explicitly set by the user, suitable values will be chosen. If incompatible values are set, a Connection Exception is thrown. |  `false` |
| Linger time  a| Number a|  The producer groups together any records that arrive in between request transmissions into a single batched request. Normally this occurs only under load when records arrive faster than they can be sent out. However, in some circumstances the client may want to reduce the number of requests, even under moderate load.
{sp} +
{sp} +
This setting accomplishes this by adding a small amount of artificial delay (rather than immediately sending out a record the producer will wait for up to the given delay to allow other records to be sent so that the sends can be batched together). This is analogous to Nagle's algorithm in TCP. This setting gives the upper bound on the delay for batching.
{sp} +
{sp} +
After the specified `batch.size` worth of records  is received for a partition, it is sent immediately regardless of this setting, however if fewer than the specified number of bytes accumulated for this partition is received, the producer "lingers" for the specified time waiting for more records to arrive.
{sp} +
{sp} +
This setting defaults to `0` (no delay). Setting `linger.ms=5`, for example, has the effect of reducing the number of requests sent but would add up to 5ms of latency to records sent in the absence of load. |  `0` |

| Maximum in flight requests a| Number |  The maximum number of unacknowledged requests the client will send on a single connection before blocking. If the value is greater than `1` and there are failed sends, there is a risk of message re-ordering due to retries (if retries are enabled). |  `5` |
| Maximum request size a| Number |  The maximum size of a request in bytes. This setting will limit the number of record batches the producer will send in a single request to avoid sending huge requests. This is also effectively a cap on the maximum record batch size. Note that the server has its own cap on record batch size, which may be different from this. |  `1` |

| Retries amount a| Number |  Setting a value greater than zero causes the client to resend any record whose send fails with a potentially transient error. Note that this retry is no different than if the client resent the record upon receiving the error. Allowing retries without setting `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` to `1` will potentially change the ordering of records because if two batches are sent to a single partition, and the first fails and is retried but the second succeeds, then the records in the second batch may appear first. Additionally, produce requests will be failed before the number of retries has been exhausted if the timeout configured by `delivery.timeout.ms` expires before successful acknowledgment. It is recommended that users leave this configuration unset and instead use `delivery.timeout.ms` to control retry behavior. |  `1` |

If the response is not received before the timeout elapses, the client will resend the request if necessary or fail the request if retries are exhausted. This should be larger than `replica.lag.time.max.ms` (a broker configuration) to reduce the possibility of message duplication due to unnecessary producer retries. |  `30` |

If HTTPS is configured as the protocol then the user needs to configure at least the keystore in the `tls:context` child element of the `listener-config`. |  |
| Endpoint identification algorithm | String | The endpoint identification algorithm used by clients to validate server host name. The default value is an empty string, which means it is disabled. Clients including client connections created by the broker for inter-broker communication verify that the broker host name matches the host name in the brokers certificate. | |

Requests sent to brokers contain one batch for each partition with data available to send. A small batch size makes batching less common and can reduce throughput. A batch size of zero disables batching. A very large batch size might use memory less efficiently because the connector allocates a buffer of the specified batch size in anticipation of additional records. |  16 |

| Buffer size a| Number |  The total bytes of memory the producer can use to buffer records waiting to be sent to the server. If records are sent faster than they can be delivered, the producer blocks for `max.block.ms` and then  throws an exception. This setting should correspond roughly to the total memory the producer will use, but not all memory the producer uses is used for buffering.

| Compression type a| Enumeration, one of:

** NONE
** GZIP

This limits the total time that a record is delayed prior to sending, the time to wait for an acknowledgment from the broker (if expected), and the time allowed for send failures that can be retried. The producer can report a failure to send a record earlier than this value if either an unrecoverable error is encountered, the retries were exhausted, or the record was added to a batch that reached an earlier delivery expiration deadline.

| Enable idempotence a| Boolean |  When set to `true`, the producer ensures that exactly one copy of each message is written in the stream. If set to `false`, the producer retries due to broker failures and other conditions can write duplicates of the retried message in the stream. Enabling idempotence requires the value of `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` to be less than or equal to `5`, retries to be greater than `0`, and acks to be `all`. If you do not explicitly set these values, suitable values are chosen. If incompatible values are set, a ConnectionException is thrown. |  false |
| Linger time  a| Number |  The producer groups records that arrive in between request transmissions into a single batched request. Normally, this occurs under load, when records arrive faster than they can be sent out. However, in some circumstances, the client might want to reduce the number of requests, even under a moderate load.
{sp} +
{sp} +
This setting adds a small amount of artificial delay to the sending of recrords. Rather than immediately sending out a record, the producer waits for up to the specified delay to allow other records to be sent so it can batch the records together. This is analogous to Nagle's algorithm in TCP. The setting gives the upper bound on the delay for batching. Once the connector receives `batch.size` worth of records for a partition, it sends the batch immediately, regardless of this setting.

If the value is greater than `1` and there are failed sends, there is a risk of message re-ordering due to retries (for example, if retries are enabled). |  5 |
| Maximum request size a| Number |  The maximum size of a request, in bytes. This setting limits the number of record batches the producer sends in a single request.

This helps performance on both the client and the server. This configuration controls the default batch size in bytes. No attempt is made to batch records larger than this size. Requests sent to brokers will contain multiple batches, one for each partition with the data that is available to send. A small batch size makes batching less common and can reduce throughput (a batch size of zero disables batching entirely).

If records are sent faster than they can be delivered to the server, the producer blocks for `max.block.ms`, after which it throws an exception. This setting should generally correspond to the total memory the producer will use, but is not exact because the memory used by the producer is not all used for buffering. Some additional memory is used for compression (if compression is enabled), as well as for maintaining in-flight requests. The default value in the Apache Kafka documentation is `33554432` (32MB), but this should be capped to align with expected values for Mule instances in CloudHub (v0.1 core).|  1 |

The producer might report failure to send a record earlier than this configuration if either an unrecoverable error is encountered, the retries have been exhausted, or the record is added to a batch that reached an earlier delivery expiration deadline.

| Enable idempotence a| Boolean |  When set to `true`, the producer will ensure that exactly one copy of each message is written in the stream. If `false`, the producer retries due to broker failures, and so on, and may write duplicates of the retried message in the stream. Enabling idempotence requires `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` to be less than or equal to `5`, retries to be greater than `0` and acks must be `all`. If these values are not explicitly set by the user, suitable values will be chosen. If incompatible values are set, a Connection Exception is thrown. |  `false` |
| Linger time  a| Number a|  The producer groups together any records that arrive in between request transmissions into a single batched request. Normally this occurs only under load when records arrive faster than they can be sent out. However, in some circumstances the client may want to reduce the number of requests, even under moderate load.

This setting accomplishes this by adding a small amount of artificial delay (rather than immediately sending out a record the producer will wait for up to the given delay to allow other records to be sent so that the sends can be batched together). This is analogous to Nagle's algorithm in TCP. This setting gives the upper bound on the delay for batching.

After the specified `batch.size` worth of records  is received for a partition, it is sent immediately regardless of this setting, however if fewer than the specified number of bytes accumulated for this partition is received, the producer "lingers" for the specified time waiting for more records to arrive. This setting defaults to `0` (no delay). Setting `linger.ms=5`, for example, has the effect of reducing the number of requests sent but would add up to 5ms of latency to records sent in the absence of load. |  `0` |

This is analogous to Nagle's algorithm in TCP. The setting gives the upper bound on the delay for batching. Once the connector receives `batch.size` worth of records for a partition, it sends the batch immediately, regardless of this setting.

This setting defaults to `0`, which means no delay. Setting `linger.ms=5`, for example, has the same effect of reducing the number of requests sent, but adds up to 5ms of latency to records sent in the absence of load. |  0 |

| Maximum in flight requests a| Number |  The maximum number of unacknowledged requests the client will send on a single connection before blocking. If the value is greater than `1` and there are failed sends, there is a risk of message re-ordering due to retries (for example, if retries are enabled). |  5 |
| Maximum request size a| Number |  The maximum size of a request, in bytes. This setting limits the number of record batches the producer sends in a single request. This effectively provides a cap on the maximum record batch size. The server has its own cap on record batch size, which can be different from this value. |  1 |

This retry is the same as having the client resend the record upon receiving the error. Allowing retries without setting `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` to `1` can change the ordering of records when the following is true:

* Two batches are sent to a single partition
* The first batch fails and is retried
* The second batch succeeds

Producer requests are failed before the number of retries is exhausted if the timeout configured by `delivery.timeout.ms` expires before a successful acknowledgment. It is best to leave this value unset and use `delivery.timeout.ms` to control retry behavior. |  1 |

If the response is not received before the timeout elapses, the client resends the request if necessary or fails the request if retries are exhausted. This value should be larger than `replica.lag.time.max.ms` (a broker configuration) to reduce the possibility of message duplication due to unnecessary producer retries. |  30 |
| TLS Configuration a| <<Tls>> |  Protocol to use for communication. Valid values are HTTP (default) and HTTPS. When using HTTPS, the HTTP communication is secured using TLS or SSL. If HTTPS was configured as the protocol, then the user needs to configure at least the keystore in the `tls:context` child element of this `listener-config`. |  |

| Bootstrap server URLs a| Array of String |  The list of servers to bootstrap the connection with the Kafka cluster. This can be a partial list of the available servers. |  | x
| Batch size a| Number |  The producer attempts to batch records together into fewer requests whenever multiple records are sent to the same partition. This helps performance on both the client and the server. This configuration controls the default batch size in bytes. No attempt is made to batch records larger than this size. Requests sent to brokers will contain multiple batches, one for each partition with the data that is available to send. A small batch size makes batching less common and can reduce throughput (a batch size of zero disables batching entirely). A very large batch size can result in more wasteful use of memory as a buffer of the specified batch size is always allocated in anticipation of additional records. |  `16` |
| The batch size unit of measure. a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB |  The unit of measure for the batch size scalar |  `KB` |
| Buffer size a| Number |  The total bytes of memory the producer can use to buffer records waiting to be sent to the server. If records are sent faster than they can be delivered to the server, the producer blocks for `max.block.ms`, after which it throws an exception. This setting should generally correspond to the total memory the producer will use, but is not exact because the memory used by the producer is not all used for buffering. Some additional memory is used for compression (if compression is enabled), as well as for maintaining in-flight requests. The default value in the Apache Kafka documentation is `33554432` (32MB), but this should be capped to align with expected values for Mule instances in CloudHub (v0.1 core).|  1 |

| DNS lookups a| Enumeration, one of:

** DEFAULT
** USE_ALL_DNS_IPS
** RESOLVE_CANONICAL_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_ONLY |  Controls how the client uses DNS lookups. If set to `use_all_dns_ips` then, when the lookup returns multiple IP addresses for a hostname, the connection is attempted on all of the IP addresses before failing the connection. Applies to both bootstrap and advertised servers. If the value is `resolve_canonical_bootstrap_servers_only`, each entry is resolved and expanded into a list of canonical names. |  `DEFAULT` |
| Compression type a| Enumeration, one of:

** NONE
** GZIP
** SNAPPY
** LZ4
** ZSTD |  The compression type for all data generated by the producer. The default is none (no compression). Valid values are none, gzip, snappy, lz4, or zstd. Compression is performed on full batches of data, so the efficacy of batching also impacts the compression ratio (more batching means better compression). |  `NONE` |
| Connections maximum idle time a| Number | Close idle connections after the specified time is reached. |  `540` |

** NANOSECONDS

** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Determines the time unit for the connection's maximum idle scalar. | `SECONDS` |
| Delivery Timeout a| Number |  An upper limit on the time to report success or failure after a call to `send()` returns. This limits the total time that a record will be delayed prior to sending, the time to await acknowledgment from the broker (if expected), and the time allowed for retrying send failures. The producer might report failure to send a record earlier than this configuration if either an unrecoverable error is encountered, the retries have been exhausted, or the record is added to a batch that reached an earlier delivery expiration deadline. The value of this configuration should be greater than or equal to the sum of `request.timeout.ms` and `linger.ms`. | `120` |

** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES

** DAYS |  Determines the time unit for the delivery timeout scalar. |  SECONDS |
| Enable idempotence a| Boolean |  When set to `true`, the producer will ensure that exactly one copy of each message is written in the stream. If `false`, the producer retries due to broker failures, and so on, and may write duplicates of the retried message in the stream. Enabling idempotence requires `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` to be less than or equal to `5`, retries to be greater than `0` and acks must be `all`. If these values are not explicitly set by the user, suitable values will be chosen. If incompatible values are set, a Connection Exception is thrown. |  `false` |
| Linger time  a| Number a|  The producer groups together any records that arrive in between request transmissions into a single batched request. Normally this occurs only under load when records arrive faster than they can be sent out. However, in some circumstances the client may want to reduce the number of requests, even under moderate load.

This setting accomplishes this by adding a small amount of artificial delay (rather than immediately sending out a record the producer will wait for up to the given delay to allow other records to be sent so that the sends can be batched together). This is analogous to Nagle's algorithm in TCP. This setting gives the upper bound on the delay for batching.

After the specified `batch.size` worth of records  is received for a partition, it is sent immediately regardless of this setting, however if fewer than the specified number of bytes accumulated for this partition is received, the producer "lingers" for the specified time waiting for more records to arrive. This setting defaults to `0` (no delay). Setting `linger.ms=5`, for example, has the effect of reducing the number of requests sent but would add up to 5ms of latency to records sent in the absence of load. |  `0` |

Allowing retries without setting `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` to `1` will potentially change the ordering of records because if two batches are sent to a single partition, and the first fails and is retried but the second succeeds, then the records in the second batch may appear first. Additionally, produce requests will be failed before the number of retries has been exhausted if the timeout configured by `delivery.timeout.ms` expires before successful acknowledgment. It is recommended that users leave this configuration unset and instead use `delivery.timeout.ms` to control retry behavior. |  `1` |

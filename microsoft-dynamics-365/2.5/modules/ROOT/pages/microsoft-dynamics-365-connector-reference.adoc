[NOTE]
Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connector sources use Object Store to save watermarks. You might experience limitations that are specific to the Object Store implementation you are using (Object Store for CloudHub deployments or Object Store for on-premises deployments), so configure Object Store to suit your needs. +

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Frequency a| Number | How often to attempt to reconnect, in milliseconds. |  |
| Blocking a| Boolean | If `false`, the reconnection strategy runs in a separate, non-blocking thread. |  |
| Count a| Number | How many reconnection attempts the Mule app can make. |  |
|===

[[reconnect-forever]]
=== Reconnect Forever

Configures a forever reconnection strategy by which the connector source or operation attempts to reconnect at a specified frequency for as long as the Mule app runs.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required

| Use Secure Hash a| Boolean | If `true`, Mule uses a secure hash algorithm to identify a redelivered message. |  |
| Message Digest Algorithm a| String | Secure hashing algorithm to use if the *Use Secure Hash* field is `true`. If the payload of the message is a Java object, Mule ignores this value and returns the value that the payload's `hashCode()` returned. |  |
| Id Expression a| String | One or more expressions that determine if a message is redelivered. This property can be set only if the *Use Secure Hash* field is `false`. |  |

|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | Amount of instances to initially keep in memory to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can fit into this buffer, then the buffer expands according to the *Buffer Size Increment* attribute, with an upper limit of *Max In Memory Size*. Default value is `100` instances. |  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This is by how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of `0` or lower means that the buffer must not expand, meaning that a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error is raised when the buffer gets full. Default value is `100` instances. |  |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | Maximum amount of memory to use. If more than that is used, a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error is raised. A value lower than or equal to `0` means no limit. |  |

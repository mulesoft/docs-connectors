== Before You Begin

Before creating an app, you must have access to the Microsoft Dynamics 365 target resource and
Anypoint Platform. You also must understand how to create a Mule app using Anypoint Studio.

Obtain a client ID and secret for your app by logging in to the Microsoft Azure Active Directory portal at portal.azure.com.

Before starting:

You need access to a Microsoft Dynamics 365 instance for which Azure Active Directory is the Identity Provider that provides access to an application.

** Delete an entity by type
** Disassociate keys based on an identity ID
** Retrieve an entity by type
** Retrieve multiple entities using a URL request
** Retrieve multiple entities using DataSense query language
** Update an account with attributes

== Terminology

Actions::
Operations that allow side effects, such as data modification, cannot be further composed to avoid non-deterministic behavior.
Complex types::
Keyless  structured types consisting of a set of properties. Complex types are commonly used as property values in model entities, or as parameters or return values for operations.
Entities::
Instances of entity types, for example, an account or an opportunity.
Entity set::
Collections of entities, for example, an account is an entity set containing account entities. An entity's key uniquely identifies the entity within an entity set.
Entity types::
Structured types with a key. Entity types define the properties and relationships of an entity, and may derive by single inheritance from other entity types.
Enumeration types or enum types::
Primitive types whose values are constants with underlying integer values.
Functions::
Operations that do not have side effects and may support further composition, for example, with additional filter operations, functions, or an action.

== Audience

* Starting user:
To create your Mule app,
see xref:microsoft-dynamics-365-connector-design-center.adoc[Design Center Configuration]
or xref:microsoft-dynamics-365-connector-studio.adoc[Studio Configuration]. The
xref:microsoft-dynamics-365-connector-examples.adoc[Examples] topic provides one or more use cases for using the connector.
* Power user: Read the xref:microsoft-dynamics-365-connector-xml-maven.adoc[XML and Maven Support] and xref:microsoft-dynamics-365-connector-examples.adoc[Examples] topics.

== Before You Begin

Before creating an app, you must have access to the Microsoft Dynamics 365 target resource and
Anypoint Platform. You also must understand how to create a Mule app using
Design Center or Anypoint Studio.

Obtain a client ID and secret for your app by logging in to the Microsoft Azure Active Directory portal at portal.azure.com.

Before starting:

You need access to a Microsoft Dynamics 365 instance for which Azure Active Directory is the Identity Provider that provides access to an application.

== OAuth Types

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connector supports:

* OAuth by connection to servers that handle authorization and token access
* OAuth Username and Password

== Input Sources (Triggers)

Anypoint Connector for Microsoft Dynamics 365 enables you to start an app using these input sources:

* On New Object: Start your app when an object is created.
* On Modified Object: Start your app when an object is modified.

Alternatively, you can use HTTP to listen for inputs or use a scheduler to choose when to run your app.

== Trigger Required Fields

On New Object and On Modified Object have the same required field names.

* Entity Type
+
Business data as defined by a Microsoft Dynamics 365 instance.
Examples are `account` and `contact`.
+
* Connection
+
OAuth connection types. Can be `Connection` to connect via URLs to servers that handle authorization and token access, or `OAuth Username Password` to connect by specifying a user name and password.

=== Connection Required Fields

* Resource +
Resource URL for accessing the Microsoft Dynamics 365 instance
* Consumer Key +
OAuth consumer key registered with the service provider
* Consumer Secret +
OAuth consumer secret registered with the service provider
* Listener Config +
A reference to the listener that catches the access token callback endpoint
* Callback Path +
The path of the access token callback endpoint
* Authorize Path +
The path of the local HTTP endpoint that triggers the OAuth dance

=== OAuth Username Password Required Fields

* Username +
User name used to initialize the session
* Password +
Password used to authenticate against the proxy
* Resource +
Application ID URI of the web API's secured resource
* Client ID +
Application ID assigned to your app when you registered it with Azure AD. You can find this in the Azure Portal.
* Client Secret +
App secret that you created in the app registration portal for your app. It should not be used in a native app, because client secrets cannot be reliably stored on devices. It is required for web apps and web APIs, which have the ability to store the client secret securely on the server side.
* Token Request Endpoint +
URL of the OAuth token request server

== Terminology

Actions::
Operations that allow side effects, such as data modification, cannot be further composed to avoid non-deterministic behavior.
Complex types::
Keyless  structured types consisting of a set of properties. Complex types are commonly used as property values in model entities, or as parameters or return values for operations.
Entities::
Instances of entity types, for example, an account or an opportunity.
Entity set::
Collections of entities, for example, an account is an entity set containing account entities. An entity's key uniquely identifies the entity within an entity set.
Entity types::
Structured types with a key. Entity types define the properties and relationships of an entity, and may derive by single inheritance from other entity types.
Enumeration types or enum types::
Primitive types whose values are constants with underlying integer values.
Functions::
Operations that do not have side effects and may support further composition, for example, with additional filter operations, functions, or an action.

== Common Use Cases

The following use cases are described in the xref:microsoft-dynamics-365-connector-examples.adoc[Examples] topic.

* Create an account with attributes that associate an account with a contact
* Create an empty contact entity
* Create an empty opportunity entity
* Create multiple entities of the same type in a single batch request
* Delete an entity by type
* Disassociate keys based on an identity ID
* Retrieve an entity by type
* Retrieve multiple entities using a URL request
* Retrieve multiple entities using DataSense query language
* Update an account with attributes
* Update multiple entities of the same type in a single batch request

== Next Step

After you have met the prerequisites and experimented with templates and examples, you are ready to create an app with
xref:microsoft-dynamics-365-connector-design-center.adoc[Design Center] or xref:microsoft-dynamics-365-connector-studio.adoc[Anypoint Studio].

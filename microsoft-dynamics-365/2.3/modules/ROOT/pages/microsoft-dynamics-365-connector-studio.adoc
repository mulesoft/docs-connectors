= Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Studio Configuration - Mule 4

To configure a connector in Anypoint Studio:

. Install the connector
. Configure the connector
. Configure an input source for the connector

== Add the Connector to Your Project

Anypoint Studio provides two ways to add the connector to your Studio project: from the Exchange
button in the taskbar or from the Mule Palette.

=== Add the Connector Using Exchange

. In Studio, create a Mule Project.
. Click the Exchange *(X)* icon in the upper left of the Studio task bar.
. In Exchange, click *Login* and supply your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. In Exchange, search for Microsoft Dynamics 365.
. Select the connector, click *Add to project*.
. Follow the prompts to install the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connector.

=== Add the Connector in Studio

. In Studio, create a Mule Project.
. In the Mule Palette, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Modules to Project*, type Microsoft Dynamics 365 in the search field.
. Click the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connector name in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

== Configure an Input Source

Configure an input source trigger for the connector using *On modified object* or *On new object*. When a new or modified
object occurs in the Microsoft Dynamics 365 operation, an input source is sent to the connector app.

See xref:index.adoc#trigger-required-fields[Trigger Required Fields] to configure the
input source operations.

Alternatively, you can also trigger a connector app by listening for HTTP requests or at timed intervals using Scheduler.

== Configure the Connector

Create a new Mule project using the Anypoint Studio visual editor:

. In Anypoint Studio, click *File* > *New* > *Mule Project*.
. Specify a Project Name and click *Finish*.
. Search for "http" and drag the HTTP connector to the canvas.
. Click the green
plus sign (+) next to *Connector Configuration*, and click *OK* in the menu to accept the default values.
. Search for "365" and drag the Microsoft Dynamics 365 connector to the canvas.
Click the green plus sign (+) next to *Connector Configuration* and specify your access credentials.
. Click a connection strategy for authentication:
+
** Microsoft Dynamics 365 OAuth 2.0 Connection
** Microsoft Dynamics 365 OAuth 2.0 Username-Password

=== Configure OAuth 2.0 Authentication

OAuth 2.0 authentication is implemented and managed by Mule runtime engine rather than by the connector itself.

To configure OAuth 2.0 authentication:

. Enter the following required information on the *General* tab of the *Global Element Properties* screen to configure *Connection* authentication:
* *Resource* +
Resource URL for accessing the Microsoft Dynamics 365 instance
* *Consumer Key* +
OAuth consumer key registered with the service provider
* *Consumer Secret* +
OAuth consumer secret registered with the service provider
* *Listener Config* +
A reference to the listener that receives the access token callback endpoint
* *Callback Path* +
The path of the access token callback endpoint
* *Authorize Path* +
The path of the local HTTP endpoint that triggers the OAuth dance
+
The following image shows an example OAuth Connection configuration using property placeholder values:
+
image::dynamics-oauth-connection.png[Global element configuration for OAuth Connection]
+
For the *Authorization url* and *Access token url*, replace the variables `<authorization-url>` and `<access-token>` with your own authorization and access URL tokens.
. Call the `/authorize` path by pasting it into a web page.
. On the returned web page, perform the authorization steps by providing your credentials, and so on.

After you complete the proper authorization steps, the web page is automatically redirected to the path you configured inside the *Callback Path* field, for example, `/oauth2callback`. This redirect contains additional properties, including an access code for the connector to use.

Once the app is authorized, the connector refreshes the token automatically. However, in the event of a restart, you must call the `/authorize` path again and perform the authorization steps.

=== Configure OAuth 2.0 Username-Password Authentication

To configure OAuth 2.0 Username-Password authentication, follow these steps:

. Click the green plus sign (+) to the right of *Connector Configuration*.
. Provide the following credentials to enable access to your Microsoft Dynamics 365 server:
+
* *General* tab:
+
[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|Client ID |The application ID assigned to your app when you registered it with Azure Active Directory. You can find this in the Azure Portal. Click *Active Directory*, click the directory, choose the application, and click *Configure*.
|Client Secret |The application secret that you created in the app registration portal for your app. This should not be used in a native app, because client secrets cannot be reliably stored on devices. This is required for web apps and web APIs, which have the ability to store the client secret securely on the server side.
|Username |User name used to initialize the session
|Password |Password used to authenticate the user
|Resource |The application ID URI of the web API (secured resource). This must be the root URI, without specifing the CRM version: for example, `+https://YOUR_ORG.crm.dynamics.com/+`.
|Token Request Endpoint |The token endpoint that is called to get the access token: for example, `+https://login.windows.net/TENANT_ID/oauth2/token+`, where TENANT_ID is the Azure Active Directory ID.
|===
+
* *Advanced* tab:
+
[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|Read Timeout |The duration in milliseconds that the consumer waits for a response before
timing out. Zero (0) means wait forever.
|Connection Timeout |The duration in milliseconds that the consumer tries to establish a connection before timing out. Zero (0) means wait forever.
|===
+
. Click *Test Connection* to ensure that your credentials are accepted at the server endpoint.
. If present, click *Enable DataSense* to let your application acquire metadata from the server.

== Run a Flow

. In Package Explorer, right-click your project's name and click *Run As* > *Mule Application*.
. Check the console to see when the application starts.
You should see messages such as these if no errors occur:

| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Active a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can be borrowed from a session at one time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of components that can be active at one time. When Max Active is exceeded, the pool is exhausted. |  |
| Max Idle a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can sit idle in the pool at any time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of Mule components that can be idle at one time. |  |
| Max Wait a| Number | Specifies the number of milliseconds to wait for a pooled component to become available when the pool is exhausted and the Exhausted Action is set to `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT` |  |
| Min Eviction Millis a| Number | Determines the minimum amount of time an object can sit idle in the pool before it is eligible for eviction. When non-positive, no objects are evicted from the pool due to idle time alone. |  |
| Eviction Check Interval Millis a| Number | Specifies the number of milliseconds between runs of the object evictor. When non-positive, no object evictor is executed. |  |
| Exhausted Action a| Enumeration, one of:

** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW
** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT
** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL a| Specifies the behavior of the Mule component pool when the pool is exhausted. Possible values are:

* WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL, which throws a NoSuchElementException
* WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT, which blocks by invoking Object.wait(long) until a new or idle object is available
* WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW, which creates a new Mule instance and returns it, which makes the Max Active value meaningless. If a positive Max Wait value is supplied, it blocks for at most that many milliseconds, after which a NoSuchElementException is thrown. If Max Thread Wait is a negative value, it blocks indefinitely.
|  |

| Initialisation Policy a| Enumeration, one of:

** INITIALISE_NONE
** INITIALISE_ONE
** INITIALISE_ALL a| Determines how components in a pool should be initialized: Possible values are:

* INITIALISE_NONE, which does not load components into the pool at startup
* INITIALISE_ONE, which loads one initial component into the pool at startup
* INITIALISE_ALL, which loads all components into the pool at startup |  |

| Disabled a| Boolean | Whether pooling is disabled |  |

[[RedeliveryPolicy]]
=== Redelivery Policy

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Redelivery Count a| Number | The maximum number of times a message can be redelivered and processed unsuccessfully before triggering a process-failed message |  |
| Use Secure Hash a| Boolean | Whether to use a secure hash algorithm to identify a redelivered message. |  |
| Message Digest Algorithm a| String | The secure hashing algorithm to use.  | `SHA-256` |
| Id Expression a| String | Defines one or more expressions to use to determine when a message has been redelivered. This property may only be set if useSecureHash is false. |  |
| Object Store a| Object Store | The object store where the redelivery counter for each message is stored. |  |

[[repeatable-in-memory-iterable]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Iterable

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | The number of instances to keep in memory to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can fit into this buffer, then it expands according to the bufferSizeIncrement attribute, with an upper limit of Max In Memory Size. Default value is 100 instances. | 100  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | Specifies how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial specified size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer should not expand, and that a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised when the buffer gets full. Default value is 100 instances. |100  |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | The maximum amount of memory to use. If more memory is used, a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised. A value lower or equal to zero means no limit. |  |
|===

[[repeatable-file-store-iterable]]
=== Repeatable File Store Iterable

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max In Memory Size a| Number | The maximum number of instances that are kept in memory. If more instances are required, then the connector starts to buffer the contents onto disk. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which maxInMemorySize is expressed. |  |

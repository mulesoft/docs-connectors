== Prerequisites

Before creating an app, you must have access to the Microsoft Dynamics 365 target resource and
Anypoint Platform. You also must understand how to create a Mule app using
Design Center or Anypoint Studio.

Obtain a client ID and secret for your app by logging in to the Microsoft Azure Active Directory portal at portal.azure.com.

Before starting:

You need access to a Microsoft Dynamics 365 instance for which Azure Active Directory is the Identity Provider that provides access to an application.

== Common Use Cases

The following use cases are described in the xref:microsoft-dynamics-365-connector-examples.adoc[Examples] topic.

* Create an account with attributes that associate an account with a contact
* Create an empty contact entity
* Create an empty opportunity entity
* Create multiple entities of the same type in a single batch request
* Delete an entity by type
* Disassociate keys based on an identity ID
* Retrieve an entity by type
* Retrieve multiple entities using a URL request
* Retrieve multiple entities using DataSense query language
* Update an account with attributes
* Update multiple entities of the same type in a single batch request

== Audience

* New users, read:
** xref:microsoft-dynamics-365-connector-studio.adoc[Use Studio to Configure the Connector] to create your Mule app
** xref:microsoft-dynamics-365-connector-examples.adoc[Examples], which provides an example use case for the connector
* Advanced users, read:
** xref:microsoft-dynamics-365-connector-xml-maven.adoc[XML and Maven Support]
** xref:microsoft-dynamics-365-connector-examples.adoc[Examples], which provides an example use case for the connector

== Authentication Types

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connector supports:

* *Connection* +
OAuth connection to servers that handle authorization and token access
* *OAuth Username and Password* +
OAuth that uses a username and password to authenticate the connection to the server

== Terminology

Actions::
Operations that allow side effects, such as data modification, cannot be further composed to avoid non-deterministic behavior.
Complex types::
Keyless  structured types consisting of a set of properties. Complex types are commonly used as property values in model entities, or as parameters or return values for operations.
Entities::
Instances of entity types, for example, an account or an opportunity.
Entity set::
Collections of entities, for example, an account is an entity set containing account entities. An entity's key uniquely identifies the entity within an entity set.
Entity types::
Structured types with a key. Entity types define the properties and relationships of an entity, and may derive by single inheritance from other entity types.
Enumeration types or enum types::
Primitive types whose values are constants with underlying integer values.
Functions::
Operations that do not have side effects and may support further composition, for example, with additional filter operations, functions, or an action.



== Using Exchange Templates and Examples

https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Anypoint Exchange] provides templates
that you can use as starting points for your apps and examples that illustrate a complete solution.


== Next Step

After you have met the prerequisites and experimented with templates and examples, you are ready to create an app with xref:microsoft-dynamics-365-connector-studio.adoc[Anypoint Studio].

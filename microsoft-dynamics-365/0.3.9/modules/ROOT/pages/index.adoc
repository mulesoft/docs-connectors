Version: 1.0.0

The Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connector enables integration with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Web API.

*Release Notes*: xref:release-notes::connector/microsoft-dynamics-365-release-notes.adoc[Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connector Release Notes] +
*Sample*: link:{attachmentsdir}/ms-dynamics-365-demo.zip[ms-dynamics-365-demo.zip]


This connector lets you perform operations to:

* Authorize or unauthorize server access.
* Create, update, and delete entities.
* Retrieve a single entity or query multiple entities.
* Associate and disassociate entities.
* Execute actions.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule, xref:3.9@mule-runtime::anypoint-connectors.adoc[Anypoint Connectors], and the Anypoint Studio Essentials. To increase your familiarity with Studio, consider completing one or more Anypoint Studio Tutorials. Further, this page assumes that you have a basic understanding of xref:3.9@mule-runtime::mule-concepts.adoc[Mule flows] and xref:3.9@mule-runtime::global-elements.adoc[Mule Global Elements].

Obtain a client ID and secret for your app by logging into the Microsoft Azure Active Directory portal at portal.azure.com.

Before starting:

* You need access to a Microsoft Dynamics 365 instance (online or on-premise) leveraged by Azure Active Directory; that is, Azure Active Directory is the Identity Provider that provides access to an application.
* Set the DataSense timeout in Anypoint Studio to a duration longer than 500 seconds. You can set this value from the Preferences menu > Anypoint Studio > DataSense > DataSense Connection Timeout.

== About Connector Terminology

* Actions - Operations that allow side effects, such as data modification, and cannot be further composed to avoid non-deterministic behavior.
* Complex types - Keyless named structured types consisting of a set of properties. Complex types are commonly used as property values in model entities, or as parameters or return values for operations.
* Entities - Instances of entity types, for example, an account or an opportunity.
* Entity sets - Named collections of entities, for example, an account is an entity set containing account entities. An entity's key uniquely identifies the entity within an entity set.
* Entity types - Named structured types with a key. Entity types define the named properties and relationships of an entity, and may derive by single inheritance from other entity types.
* Enumeration types or Enum types - Named primitive types whose values are named constants with underlying integer values.
* Functions - Operations that do not have side effects and may support further composition, for example, with additional filter operations, functions or an action.

== To Install and Configure the Connector

. Download and install Java 8 (latest version) or Java 7 (deprecated by Oracle).
+
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[JDK 8 Download]
+
. Click the Anypoint Exchange image:365-exchange-icon.png[] icon in the taskbar, search for 365, and follow the prompts to install the connector.

*Note:* JCE is not required for this connector.

== To Create a New Mule Project Using the Anypoint Studio Visual Editor

. In Anypoint Studio, click File > New > Mule Project.
. Specify a Project Name and click Finish.
. Search for "http" and drag the HTTP connector to the canvas. Click the green
plus sign next to Connector Configuration, and click OK in the menu to accept the default values.
. Search for "365" and drag the Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM connector to the canvas.
Click the green plus next to Connector Configuration, and specify your access credentials.
. Click a connection strategy for authentication:
+
** Microsoft Dynamics 365 OAuth 2.0 Connection
** Microsoft Dynamics 365 OAuth 2.0 Username-Password

=== To Configure OAuth 2.0 Connection

This configuration provides access to the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Web API.

. Click the green plus sign to the right of Connector Configuration.
. Provide the Client ID and Secret values.
. Choose an action if a token is not provided:
+
.. EXCEPTION (Default) - Causes an exception if there is no token.
.. STOP_FLOW - Stops running the Mule project if there is no token.
+
. If needed, set the OAuth tab in Global Element Properties as described in xref:3.9@mule-runtime::using-a-connector-to-access-an-oauth-api.adoc[Using a Connector to Access an OAuth API].

To implement OAuth 2.0 in the Connection configuration, you need to use Mule Runtime 3.6.5, ESB 3.7.6 or 3.8.5, or newer versions.

=== To Configure OAuth 2.0 Username-Password

. Click the green plus sign to the right of Connector Configuration.
. Provide the following credentials to enable access to your Microsoft Dynamics 365 server:
+
** Client ID - The application ID assigned to your app when you registered it with Azure Active Directory. You can find this in the Azure Portal. Click Active Directory, click the directory, choose the application, and click Configure.
** Client Secret - The application secret that you created in the app registration portal for your app. This should not be used in a native app, because client secrets cannot be reliably stored on devices. This is required for web apps and web APIs, which have the ability to store the client secret securely on the server side.
** Username - Username used to initialize the session.
** Password - Password used to authenticate the user.
** Resource - The application ID URI of the web API (secured resource). This must be the root URI, without specifing the CRM version. Example: `+https://YOUR_ORG.crm.dynamics.com/+`
** Token Request Endpoint - The token endpoint that is called to get the access token. Example: `+https://login.windows.net/TENANT_ID/oauth2/token+` where TENANT_ID is the Azure Active Directory ID.
** Read Timeout - The duration in milliseconds that the consumer waits for a response before
timing out. Zero (0) means wait forever.
** Connection Timeout - Specifies the duration in milliseconds that the consumer tries to establish a connection before timing out. Zero (0) means wait forever.
+
. Click Test Connection to ensure that your credentials are accepted at the server endpoint.
. If present, click Enable DataSense to let your application acquire metadata from the server.

For information on setting the Pooling Profile tab, see xref:3.9@mule-runtime::tuning-performance.adoc#about-pooling-profiles[About Pooling Profiles].

For information on setting the Reconnection tab, see xref:3.9@mule-runtime::configuring-reconnection-strategies.adoc[Configuring Reconnection Strategies].

== To Run a Flow

. In Package Explorer, right click your project's name, and click Run As > Mule Application.
. Check the console to see when the application starts. You should see messages such as these if no errors occur:

== Example: Microsoft Dynamics 365

This example demonstrates the use of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connector.

To build and run this demo project, you need:

* Anypoint Studio with at least the Mule 3.5 Runtime.
* Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connector v1.0.0 or higher.
* Dynamics 365 leveraged by Azure Active Directory.

=== To Test the Flow

. Import the demo project into your workspace using Anypoint Exchange or using the Import command in the File menu.
. Specify your OAuth 2 credentials for OAuth 2 Username-Password configuration in the `/src/main/app/mule-app.properties` file:
+
** dynamics365.username - Username used to initialize the session.
** dynamics365.password - Password used to authenticate the user.
** dynamics365.resource - The App ID URI of the web API, which is a secured resource. The resource must be a root URI that does not specify the CRM version. Example: `+https://YOUR_ORG.crm.dynamics.com/+`
** dynamics365.clientId - The application ID assigned to your app when you registered it with Azure Active Directory. You can find this in the Azure Portal. Click Active Directory, click the directory, choose the application, and click Configure.
** dynamics365.clientSecret - The application secret that you created in the app registration portal for your app. This should not be used in a native app, because a client secret cannot be reliably stored on a device. The client secret is required for web apps and web APIs, which have the ability to store the client secret securely on the server side.
** dynamics365.tokenRequestEndpoint - The token endpoint to call to get an access token. +
Example: `+https://login.windows.net/TENANT_ID/oauth2/token` where TENANT_ID is the Azure Active Directory ID.
+
. Specify DataSense Connection Timeout with more than 200 seconds because the connector makes several requests to provide DataSense information.
. Run the project in Studio.
. Type `0.0.0.0:8081` in your browser to access the selection menu of the demo.
. Optionally you can configure the Connection Timeout and Read Timeout.
The Connection Timeout is the timeout in making the initial connection with the server.
The Read Timeout is the timeout on waiting to read data from the server.

You can use the selection menu from `+http://0.0.0.0:8081+` to test the flows or you can POST JSONs using a tool like curl, or any other tool (Chrome/Mozilla Firefox extensions) that lets you POST a body when calling the URL.

= Configure the Quality of Service for MQTT 3 Connector

The MQTT protocol enables you to specify levels of delivery assurance for inbound or outbound messages. These levels
are referred to as quality of service (QoS).

The available QoS levels to configure for MQTT 3 Connector are:

 * *AT_MOST_ONCE*
+
The message will be delivered at most one time (fire and forget). The level does not guarantee that the message will be received at all.
 * *AT_LEAST_ONCE*
+
The message will be delivered correctly at least one time. The message could be delivered more than once.
 * *EXACTLY_ONCE*
+
The level guarantees that the message will be delivered correctly exactly one time.

The quality of service can be different for publishing and subscribing, even if the published message and the subscription
have a common topic. So, a message can be published with QoS 1 or 2, and still not reach the *Listener* source, if said *Listener* source
subscribed with QoS *AT_MOST_ONCE* (QoS=0).

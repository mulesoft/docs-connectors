Support Category: https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#anypoint-connectors[Select]

Anypoint Connector for Snowflake (Snowflake Connector) enables you to connect with your Snowflake instance to load data, run queries in Snowflake tables, and sync data with external business applications.

For information about compatibility and fixed issues, see the Snowflake Connector Release Notes. 

== Prerequisites

To use this connector, you must be familiar with:

* The Snowflake API
* Anypoint Connectors
* Mule runtime engine (Mule)
* Elements and global elements in a Mule flow

* Anypoint Platform
* Anypoint Studio version 7.3 or later


== Common Use Cases For the Connector

These are some common use cases for Snowflake Connector: 

* Load bulk or continuous data into your Snowflake instance.
* Run queries to insert, delete, update, and merge data in Snowflake tables.
* Sync data:
** Keep unstructured data (files) in an external data location in sync with unstructured data in Snowflake, when the external data location is the source of truth.
** Keep unstructured data (files) in an external data location in sync with unstructured data in Snowflake, when Snowflake is the source of truth.
** Keep structured data (tables) in an external data location in sync with Snowflake (in tables), when the external data location is the source of truth.
** Keep structured data (tables) in an external data location in sync with Snowflake (in tables), when Snowflake is the source of truth.


For examples, see xref:snowflake-connector-examples.adoc[Snowflake Connector Examples] use cases.

== Configuration

=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | |x
| Connection a| * Linux Configuration
* Windows Configuration
 | The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | |x
| Expiration Policy a| ExpirationPolicy |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform expires the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime purges instances as it sees fit. |  |
|===

== Connection Types

[[config_linux]]
=== Linux Configuration


==== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| IPAddress a| String |  Host used to initialize the session. |  |x
| UserName a| String |  Username used to initialize the session. The value for this field, can be, for example: `username` or `username@domain`|  |x
| Password a| String |  Password used to authenticate the user. |  |x
| Reconnection a| Reconnection |  When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to true, deployment fails if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy. |  |

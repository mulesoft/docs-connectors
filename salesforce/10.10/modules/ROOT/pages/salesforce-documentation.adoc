[[create]]
=== Create
`<salesforce:create>`

+++
Adds one or more new records to your organization's data. <p class="caution"> IMPORTANT: When you map your objects to the input of this message processor, they must match the expected type of the object at Salesforce. </p> <p> For example, if you set the CloseDate field of an Opportunity to a string type with a value of "2011-12-13" it is sent to Salesforce as a string and the operation is rejected on the basis that the CloseDate is not of the expected type. </p> <p> The proper way to map the previous example is to generate a Java Date object. You can use Groovy to evaluate the expression as <i>#[groovy:Date.parse("yyyy-MM-dd", "2011-12-13")]</i>. </p>

 updating an existing contact.IMPORTANT if you are converting a lead into a person account, do not specify the contactId or an error will result. Specify only the accountId
 of the person account. If no contactID is specified, then the API creates a new contact that is implicitly associated with the Account. To create a new contact, the client
 application must be logged in with sufficient access rights. To merge a lead into an existing contact, the client application must be logged in with read/write access to the
 specified contact. The contact name and other existing data are not overwritten (unless overwriteLeadSource is set to true, in which case only the LeadSource field is
 overwritten). For information on IDs, see ID Field Type. |  |

 creates a new account. To create a new account, the client application must be logged in with sufficient access rights. To merge a lead into an existing account, the client
 application must be logged in with read/write access to the specified account. The account name and other existing data are not overwritten. For information on IDs, see ID

 from the lead. An opportunity is created by default. | false | 
| Over Write Lead Source a| Boolean | Specifies whether to overwrite the LeadSource field on the target Contact object with the contents of the LeadSource field in the source Lead object (true), or not (false,

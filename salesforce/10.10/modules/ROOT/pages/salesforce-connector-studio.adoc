= Use Studio to Configure Salesforce Connector 10.10 - Mule 4
:page-aliases: connectors::salesforce/salesforce-connector-studio.adoc, connectors::salesforce/salesforce-connector-design-center.adoc

Anypoint Studio (Studio) editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.

To add and configure a connector in Studio:

. <<create-mule-project,Create a Mule project>>.
. <<add-connector-to-project,Add the connector to your Mule project>>.
. <<configure-input-source,Configure a source for the connector's flow>>.
. <<add-connector-operation,Add a connector operation to the flow>>.
. <<configure-global-element,Configure a global element for the connector>>
. <<configure-other-fields,Configure the other connector fields>>.

When you run the connector, you can view the app log to check for problems, as described in <<view-app-log,View the App Log>>.

If you are new to configuring connectors in Studio, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-config-use-studio.adoc[Use Studio to Configure a Connector]. If, after reading this topic, you need additional information about the connector fields, see xref:salesforce-connector-reference.adoc[Salesforce Reference].

[[create-mule-project]]
== Create a Mule Project

In Studio, create a new Mule project in which to add and configure the connector:

. In Studio, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
. Enter a name for your Mule project and click *Finish*.

[[add-connector-to-project]]
== Add the Connector to Your Mule Project

Add Salesforce Connector to your Mule project to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location and add the required dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Modules to Project*, type `salesforce` in the search field.
. Click the connector name in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.

[[configure-input-source]]
== Configure a Source

A source initiates a flow when a specified condition is met. A channel or topic must be published to Salesforce before a subscription to the channel can be created.

You can configure one of these sources to use with Salesforce Connector:

* *On Deleted Object*
+
Initiates your app when a Salesforce user deletes an object. Possible object types are `Contact`, `Lead`, `Account`, `Contracts`, `Opportunity`, or the name of a custom object.
+
* *On Modified Object*
+
Initiates your app when a Salesforce user modifies an object. Possible object types are `Contact`, `Lead`, `Account`, `Contracts`, `Opportunity`, or the name of a custom object.
+
* *On New Object*
+
Initiates your app when a Salesforce user creates a new object. Possible object types are `Contact`, `Lead`, `Account`, `Contracts`, `Opportunity`, or the name of a custom object.
+
* *Replay channel listener*
+
Subscribes to a streaming channel. This source provides channel-related notification settings for new events and events stored by Salesforce within the 24-hour retention period. Events that occur in the specified channel source trigger the flow.
+
* *Replay topic listener*
+
Subscribes to a topic. This source provides topic-related notification settings for new events and events stored by Salesforce within the 24-hour retention period. Events that occur on records in the specified topic trigger the flow.
+
* *Subscribe channel listener*
+
Subscribes to a streaming channel. This source provides channel-related notification settings for new events that occur after you subscribe.
+
* *Subscribe topic listener*
+
Subscribe to a topic. This source provides topic-related notification settings for new events that occur after you subscribe.
* *HTTP > Listener*
+
Initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port
+
* *Scheduler*
+
Initiates a flow when a time-based condition is met

NOTE: A channel or topic must be published to Salesforce before a subscription to the channel can be created.

=== Example of Configuring a Source

For example, to configure *On New Object* as a source:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *On New Object*.
. Drag *On New Object* to the Studio canvas.
. On the On New Object properties window, specify a value for the *Path* field.
. Optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. Select an object type and optionally specify a UTC value in the *Since* field.
+
If the server is in a different time zone, you must specify a value in the *Since* field. If you leave the field empty, the connector uses the local timestamp.
+
. Click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of the *On New Object* source in the app.
. On the *TLS* tab, optionally specify the TLS information for the connector.
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

[[redelivery-policy]]
=== Redelivery Policy

To configure a redelivery policy for a source, set the *Redelivery* field on the source's properties window to the number of redelivery attempts to try after an initial failure.

You can specify an object store for this policy. If you don't specify an object store, Mule creates a non-persistent object store. The number of transactions used to interact with the object store varies based on the number of retries configured for the redelivery policy.

For more information about configuring a redelivery policy, see xref:mule-runtime::redelivery-policy.adoc[Redelivery Policy].

[[add-connector-operation]]
== Add a Connector Operation to the Flow

When you add a connector operation to your flow, you immediately define a specific operation for that connector to perform.

To add an operation for Salesforce Connector, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *Salesforce* and then select the desired operation.
. Drag the operation onto the Studio canvas to the right of the source.

[[configure-global-element]]
== Configure a Global Element for the Connector

When you configure a connector, it’s best to configure a global element that all instances of that connector in the app can use. Configuring a global element requires you to provide the authentication credentials the connector uses to access the target Salesforce system.

You can reference a configuration file that contains ANT-style property placeholders (recommended), or you can enter your authorization credentials in the global configuration properties. For information about the benefits of using property placeholders and how to configure them, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-connector-configuration-overview.adoc[Anypoint Connector Configuration].

To configure a global element for Salesforce Connector, follow these steps:

. Select the name of the connector in the Studio canvas.
. In the configuration screen for the operation, click the plus sign (+) next to the *Connector configuration* field to access the global element configuration fields.
. In the *General* tab, select one of these authentication methods:
+
* <<basic,Basic authentication>>
* <<oauth,OAuth 2.0 authentication>>
* <<oauth-jwt,OAuth JWT authentication>>
* <<oauth-saml,OAuth SAML authentication>>
* <<oauth-username-password,OAuth Username Password authentication>>
+
When configuring an OAuth 2.0 connection, you can specify an object store that stores each resource owner's ID data. If you don't specify an object store, Mule automatically provisions the default object store. The app interacts with the object store automatically when a new resource owner is authenticated, the access token is refreshed, or the access token is invalidated.
+
You can also <<mutual-tls,configure mutual TLS>>.
+
. In the *Apex* tab, optionally configure <<apexsets,Apex Settings>>.
. In the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

[[create]]
=== Create
`<salesforce:create>`

Adds one or more new records to your organization's data.

[IMPORTANT]
When you map your objects to the input of this message processor, the objects must match the expected type of the object at Salesforce. For example, if you set the *CloseDate* field of an opportunity to a string of value `2011-12-13`, it is sent to Salesforce as a string. The operation is rejected because the CloseDate is not of the expected type. The correct way to map it is to generate a Java Date object. You can do so using the Groovy expression evaluator as `#[groovy:Date.parse("yyyy-MM-dd", "2011-12-13")]`.

Upserts a homogeneous list of objects. Creates new records and updates existing records using a custom field to determine the presence of existing records. In most cases, use `#upsert(String, String, List, Map)` over `#create(String, List, Map)` to avoid creating unwanted, duplicate records.

[NOTE]
Although you cannot change the *Content Type* value for a bulk upsert, you can use the <<createJob, *Create Job*>> operation to set the content type to CSV (or zipped CSV if you reach the character limit) and then follow up with the <<createBatch, *Create Batch*>> operation.

values, such as adding or removing values in the picklist, use the
<<deployMetadata, *Deploy Metadata*>> operation. You must perform a metadata deploy for
*Custom Field* or *Global Picklist* based on whether the picklist is tied to a
custom field or is a global picklist.

specified contact. The contact name and other existing data are not overwritten (unless *Over Write Lead Source* is set to `true`, in which case only the lead source field is
overwritten). For information on IDs, see ID Field Type.

from the lead. An opportunity is created by default. | `false` |

** BYTE
** KB

** GB | Unit for the *In Memory Size* field. |  |
|===


[[repeatable-file-store-stream]]
=== Repeatable File Store Stream

Configures the repeatable file-store streaming strategy by which Mule keeps a portion of the stream content in memory. If the stream content is larger than the configured buffer size, Mule backs up the buffer's content to disk and then clears the memory.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| In Memory Size a| Number a| Maximum amount of memory that the stream can use for data. If the amount of memory exceeds this value, Mule buffers the content to disk. To optimize performance:

* Configure a larger buffer size to avoid the number of times Mule needs to write the buffer on disk. This increases performance, but it also limits the number of concurrent requests your application can process, because it requires additional memory.

* Configure a smaller buffer size to decrease memory load at the expense of response time. |  |

** KB
** MB
** GB | Unit for the *In Memory Size* field. |  |
|===

|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | Amount of instances to initially keep in memory to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can fit into this buffer, then the buffer expands according to the *Buffer Size Increment* attribute, with an upper limit of *Max In Memory Size*. Default value is 100 instances. |  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This is by how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of `0` or lower means that the buffer must not expand, meaning that a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error is raised when the buffer gets full. Default value is 100 instances. |  |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | Maximum amount of memory to use. If more than that is used, a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error is raised. A value lower than or equal to `0` means no limit. |  |
|===

[[repeatable-in-memory-stream]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Stream

|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | Initial amount of memory to allocate to the data stream. If the streamed data exceeds this value, the buffer expands by *Buffer Size Increment*, with an upper limit of *Max In Memory Size value*. |  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | Amount by which the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of `0` or lower specifies that the buffer can't expand. |  |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | Maximum amount of memory to use. If more than that is used, a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error is raised. A value lower than or equal to `0` means no limit. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | Unit for the *Initial Buffer Size*, *Buffer Size Increment*, and *Buffer Unit* fields. |  |

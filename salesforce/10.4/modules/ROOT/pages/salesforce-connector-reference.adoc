* <<sfdc-config_jwt, OAuth JWT>>
* <<sfdc-config_oauth-user-pass, OAuth Username Password>>
* <<sfdc-config_saml, OAuth SAML>>
| The connection types to provide to this configuration. | | x
| Read Timeout a| Number |  Specifies the amount of time, in the unit defined in Time unit, that the consumer waits for a response before it times out. |  0 |
| Time unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS

** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  A time unit that qualifies the Read Timeout |  SECONDS |
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before Mule considers it eligible for expiration.

[[create]]
=== Create
`<salesforce:create>`


Adds one or more new records to your organization's data.

IMPORTANT: When you map your objects to the input of this message processor, keep in mind that the objects need to match the expected type of the object at Salesforce. For example, if you set the CloseDate field of an Opportunity to a string of value "2011-12-13", it is sent to Salesforce as a string. The operation will be rejected because the CloseDate is not of the expected type. The correct way to map it is to generate a Java Date object. You can do so using the Groovy expression evaluator as `#[groovy:Date.parse("yyyy-MM-dd", "2011-12-13")]`.

[[repeatable-file-store-stream]]
=== Repeatable File Store Stream

File store repeatable streams require buffering, and there are different buffering strategies. Mule keeps a portion of contents in memory. If the stream contents are larger than the configured buffer size, Mule backs up the buffer’s content to disk and then clears the memory.

[non-repeatable-stream]
=== Non-repeatable Stream

In some cases, you may want to disable the repeatable stream functionality and use non-repeatable streams, which can have less performance overhead, memory use, and cost.

of the person account. If no contactID is specified, then the API creates a new contact that is implicitly associated with the Account. To create a new contact, the client
application must be logged in with sufficient access rights. To merge a lead into an existing contact, the client application must be logged in with read/write access to the

overwritten). For information on IDs, see ID Field Type. |  |

| Do Not Create Opportunity a| Boolean | Specifies whether to create an Opportunity during lead conversion (false, the default) or not (true). Set this flag to true only if you do not want to create an opportunity
from the lead. An opportunity is created by default. | false |
| Over Write Lead Source a| Boolean | Specifies whether to overwrite the LeadSource field on the target Contact object with the contents of the LeadSource field in the source Lead object (true), or not (false,
the default). To set this field to true, the client application must specify a contactId for the target contact. | false |
| Opportunity Id a| String | The ID of an existing opportunity to relate to a lead during lead conversion. |  |

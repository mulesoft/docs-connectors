= Troubleshoot Salesforce Connector 10.4 - Mule 4

== Upsert

Unless you configure the External ID Field Name for the sObject to which you are trying to upsert, the Upsert operation fails.

The Upsert operation does not work with the sObject `priceBookentry2`.

Although you can't change the `contentType` value for a bulk upsert, you can use the Create job operation to set the content type to either CSV (or zipped CSV if you're near the character limit) and then follow up with the Create batch operation.

== Query

Although you can see the fields of an sObject and their corresponding types via DataSense, the Query operation returns all fields as `String`.

To use the actual type of a field, use a Transform or Transform Message component to convert the field to the desired type.

Although the `CreatedDate` field appears as `dateTime`, the query returns a `String` value that represents the date. To use the field as a `dateTime` field, configure it using a Transform Message component.

To store `Date` and `dateTime` fields, use DataWeave expressions to create `Date` and `Calendar` Java objects.

== Insert Values in a Salesforce Connector List

Inserting dependent values into an existing list in Salesforce Connector does not always work. Test to confirm this functionality.

== Evaluate Values in a Salesforce List

If you are evaluating contents against a value in an existing list field in Salesforce, use the exact value in the list. For example, if you use the value `US` to evaluate against the contents of a list that contains the value `USA`, the evaluation works, but the result returns two values in the  list: one for `US` and one for `USA`.

== Currency

Currency values cannot exceed 18 characters in length.

When working with multiple currencies, be aware of which currency your sObject uses so that you avoid inaccurate entries. The default currency matches the location at the organization level.

== Limits on API Calls

You must know the scope of the rate limiting policy that applies to your account so that you do not exceed the number of allotted API calls per day.

== Opportunity Object

When extracting data from a Salesforce Opportunity object, be aware that a "quarter" in this context is relative to the financial year of the organization and not necessarily to the calendar year.

== Japanese Support

Salesforce Connector supports Japanese characters for all operations, with these exceptions:

* The *Publish Streaming Channel* operation does not support Japanese characters in the *Streaming Channel Name*, which can contain alphanumeric and the `&#95;` or `/` characters only. See https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.228.0.object_reference.meta/object_reference/sforce_api_objects_streamingchannel.htm[Salesforce Streaming channel documentation].

* Metadata operations might return error messages if some fields contain Japanese characters. For example, creating custom objects or custom fields with a `fullName` that contains Japanese characters triggers a `FIELD_INTEGRITY_EXCEPTION` with the following message: +
`The Object Name field can only contain underscores and alphanumeric characters. It must be unique, begin with a letter, not include spaces, not end with an underscore, and not contain two consecutive underscores.`

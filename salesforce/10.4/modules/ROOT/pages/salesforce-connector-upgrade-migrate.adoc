* Added the Merge Multiple operation to enable merging up to 200 records in a single SOAP call.

=== 10.2

This release contains the following changes:

* Added support for multiple keys in the JKS file specified for the SAML and JWT authentication mechanisms. Use the new Certificate Alias field to specify which certificate should be used. (CONN-6019, CONN-6020)
* Added support for custom headers for the Invoke APEX SOAP operation. (SE-15884)
* Bulk API V2 operations now return the response headers and status as message attributes.

=== 10.1

* Added support for subscribing to these newly-added platform events: FOStatusChangedEvent, OrderSummaryCreatedEvent, and OrderSumStatusChangedEvent.
* Added support for using the new RecordVisibilityContext clause when using the WITH filteringExpression in a query.

=== 10.0

This release contains the following changes:

* Removed deprecated connection types
* Made the following changes to some operations:
 ** Merged multiple operations into one
 ** Renamed some operations and parameters
 ** Changed some operation return types
* Redesigned the Replay ID functionality
* Changed the Mule TLS Context usage
* Improved the error types
* Removed the dependency on the Dozer library
* Removed the keep alive feature as a configurable option
+
The connector now automatically performs one API call every
14 minutes (Salesforce minimum TTL is 15 minutes), so the session no longer expires.

=== Changes in Connection Types

Salesforce Connector 10.x contains the following changes to connection types:

* Removed the following connection types:
** Username Password
** Basic Username Password
* Added connection pool functionality to improve multi-threading support.
+
With this functionality, each request sent to the API has its own headers and read timeout, which prevents the operation headers from being overridden with the wrong values when operations are executed simultaneously.
* Added a new *Security* tab for configuring TLS.
* Reordered the parameters to be more intuitive.
* Moved the `Read timeout` parameter from the provider configuration to the connector configuration.
* Removed the following parameters from the connector configuration:
** `Advanced reconnection params`
** `Allow field truncation support`
** `Assignment rule id`
** `Batch Sobject max depth`
** `Can clear fields by updating field value to null` +
In Salesforce Connector 10.x, to clear a field, you must use an `Update` or `Upsert` request and set the name of the fields you want to nullify in the *fieldsToNull* field.
** `Client id`
** `Disable session invalidation`
** `Time object store`
** `Use default rule`

== Changed Operations, Parameters, and Return Types

In Salesforce Connector 10.x, all operations contain the following new parameters:

* `Time unit`
* `Read timeout`

== Upgrade Prerequisites

Before you perform the upgrade, you must:

. Create a backup of your files, data, and configuration in case you need to restore to the previous version.
. Install Salesforce Connector 10.x to replace the Salesforce operations that were previously included in Salesforce Connector 9.x.

== Upgrade Steps

Follow these steps to perform the upgrade from Salesforce Connector v9.x to Salesforce Connector v10.x:

. In Anypoint Studio, create a Mule project.
. In the Mule Palette view, click *Search in Exchange*.
. In the *Add Dependencies to Project* window, enter `Salesforce` in the search field.
. In the *Available modules* section, select *Salesforce Connector - Mule 4* and click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.
. Verify that the `salesforce-connector` dependency version is `10.x.x` in the `pom.xml` file, where `x.x` is the minor release and patch version number. For example, if you are upgrading to v10.0, the dependency version in the `pom.xml` file should be `10.0.0`.

Studio upgrades the connector automatically.


== Verify the Upgrade

After you install the latest version of the connector, follow these steps to verify the upgrade:

. In Studio, verify that there are no errors in the *Problems* or *Console* views.
. Check the project `pom.xml` file and verify that there are no problems.
. Test the connection and verify that the operations work.

== Troubleshooting

If there are problems with caching the parameters and caching the metadata, try restarting Studio.

== Revert the Upgrade

If it is necessary to revert to the previous version of Salesforce Connector, change the `salesforce-connector` dependency version in the project's `pom.xml` file to the previous version.

You must update the project's `pom.xml` file in Anypoint Studio.

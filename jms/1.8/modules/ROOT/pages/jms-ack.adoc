= Configure Message Acknowledgement with the JMS Connector
:keywords: jms, connector, consume, message, ack


Anypoint Connector for JMS (JMS Connector) provides different message acknowledgement modes to configure for the *Ack*, *Consume*, *On New Message*, and *Recovery session* operations:

* Automatic acknowledgement on success
* Immediate acknowledgement
* Manual acknowledgement

The following examples illustrate how to configure each message acknowledgement mode.

== Configure Automatic Acknowledgement on Success Mode

Configure the automatic acknowledgement on success mode in the *On New Message* source by setting the *Acknowledge Mode* field to either one of these modes:

* *AUTO* +
Automatically acknowledges (ACK) the received message only if the flow execution completes successfully; otherwise, the message is not acknowledged and is redelivered.

* *DUPS_OK* +
Like *AUTO* mode, automatically acknowledges (ACK) the received message only if the flow execution completes successfully, but leads to duplicate messages if the message is redelivered before the ACK is performed.

In the following example, you configure the *AUTO* acknowledgement mode:

. In Studio, select the *On New Message* source from your flow.
. In the *On New Message* configuration screen, in *Destination*, specify the name of the destination from which to consume the message, for example, `#[vars.destination]`.
. From the *Acknowledge Mode* menu, select *AUTO*.

In the XML editor, the `<jms:listener>` and `ackMode` configurations look like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:listener  config-ref="JMS_Config" destination="#[vars.destination]" ackMode="AUTO"/>
----

== Configure Immediate Acknowledgement Mode

Configure the immediate acknowledgement mode in the *On New Message* source by using the *Acknowledge Mode* field, or in the *Consume* operation by using the *Ack mode* field. Set the fields to *IMMEDIATE*. This mode automatically acknowledges (ACK) the message after it is consumed and before to any application processing of the message. +
The result of automatically acknowledging the message is that the message won't be redelivered if any error occurs during message processing, requiring application logic like a "dead letter" queue to manage errors without losing messages.

In the following example, you configure the *IMMEDIATE* acknowledgement mode for the *Consume* operation:

. In Studio, select the *Consume* operation from your flow.
. In the *Consume* configuration screen, in *Destination*, specify the name of the destination from which to consume the message, for example, `#[vars.destination]`.
. From the *Ack mode* menu, select *IMMEDIATE*.

In the XML editor, the `<jms:consume>` and `ackMode` configurations look like this:


== Configure Manual Acknowledgement Mode

Configure the manual acknowledgement mode in the *On New Message* source by using the *Acknowledge Mode* field, or in the *Consume* operation by using the *Ack mode* field. Set these fields to *MANUAL*. This mode delegates all responsibility for performing message acknowledgement (ACK) to the application logic.

Every message received by either the *On New Message* or *Consume* operations includes an acknowledgement ID in the Mule message attributes, that identifies the message uniquely for a given connection.  +
The acknowledgement ID that identifies the message is then passed to the *Ack* operation in the *Ack id* field.

In the following example, you configure the *MANUAL* acknowledgement mode for the *Consume* operation:

. In Studio, select the *Consume* operation from your flow.
. In the *Consume* configuration screen, in *Destination*, specify the name of the destination from which to consume the message, for example, `openTickets`.
. From the *Ack mode* menu, select *MANUAL*.
. Drag a *Logger* component to the right of the *Consume* operation.
. Set the *Message* field to `#[payload]`.
. Drag an *Ack* operation to the right of the *Logger* component.
. Set the *Ack id* field to the acknowledgement ID of the message session to recover, for example, `#[attributes.ackId]`.

In the XML editor, the `<jms:consume>`, `ackMode`, and `ackId` configurations look like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="consumerWithManualAck">
    <jms:consume config-ref="JMS_config" destination="openTickets" ackMode="MANUAL"/>

    <!--Do message processing-->
    <logger message="#[payload]">

    <jms:ack ackId="#[attributes.ackId]"/>
</flow>
----


=== Configure Manual Session Recovery

With manual acknowledgement mode, all messages received but not acknowledged are not redelivered by the broker.
If there is an error during the message processing, you must manually recover all the messages in the session that have to be redelivered by using the *Recover session* operation. The connection used to recover the session has to be the same as the connection for receiving the message.

In the following example, you configure the *MANUAL* acknowledgement mode and how to recover the session:

. In Studio, select the *Consume* operation from your flow.
. In the *Consume* configuration screen, in *Destination*, specify the name of the destination from which to consume the message, for example, `${destination}`.
. Set the *Ack mode* field to *MANUAL*.
. Drag a *Logger* component to the right of the *Consume* operation.
. Set the *Message* field to `#[payload]`.
. Drag an *Ack* operation to the right of the *Logger* component.
. Set the *Ack id* field to the acknowledgement ID of the message session to recover, for example, `#[vars.consumedMessage.attributes.ackId]`.
. In your flow, expand the *Error handling* section by clicking the small arrow.
. Drag an *On Error Propagate* component in the *Error handling* section.
. Drag a *Recover session* operation inside the *On Error Propagate* component.
. Set the *Ack id* field to `#[vars.consumedMessage.attributes.ackId]`.

In the XML editor, the `<jms:consume>`, `ackMode`, and `ackId` configurations look like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="consumerWithManualAck">
    <jms:consume config-ref="JMS_config" destination="${destination}"
                 ackMode="MANUAL" target="consumedMessage" targetValue="#[message]"/>

    <!--Do message processing-->
    <logger message="#[payload]">

    <jms:ack ackId="#[vars.consumedMessage.attributes.ackId]"/>

    <error-handler>
        <on-error-propagate>
            <!--In case of error, recover the session-->
            <jms:recover-session ackId="#[vars.consumedMessage.attributes.ackId]"/>
        </on-error-continue>
    </error-handler>
</flow>

==== Parameters
[%header,cols="20s,20a,35a,20a,5a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x

** ALWAYS
** NEVER | Whether to specify a correlationId when publishing messages. This applies both for custom correlation IDs specifies at the operation level and for default correlation IDs taken from the current event | AUTO |
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> | Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before Mule considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform expires the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. Mule purges the instances as appropriate. |  |
| Ack Mode a| Enumeration, one of:

** IMMEDIATE

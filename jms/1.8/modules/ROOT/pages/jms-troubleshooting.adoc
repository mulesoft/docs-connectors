= Troubleshooting JMS Connector - Mule 4

To troubleshoot Anypoint Connector for JMS (Java Message Service Connector), become familiar with the information about enabling verbose logging, troubleshooting acknowledgment issues, troubleshooting JMS stopped consuming messages, troubleshooting redeployment errors when using binding mode, and interpreting commonly thrown messages.

== Enable Verbose Logging

Sometimes you are not sure why the application is failing and you require a better understanding of what is going on in the app's interaction with the JMS server.

To gather detailed logs:

* Use the configuration file to increase the logging level on the server side.
* Enable verbose logging for JMS Connector:
+
. Access Anypoint Studio and navigate to the *Package Explorer* view.
. Open your application's project name.
. Open the `src/main/resources` path folder.
. Open the `log4j2.xml` file inside the folder.
. If the following line is already in the `log4j2.xml` file, uncomment it to enable it; otherwise, add it:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
    <AsyncLogger name=“org.mule.extensions.jms” level=“DEBUG”/>
    <AsyncLogger name=“org.mule.jms.commons” level=“DEBUG”/>

== Troubleshoot Acknowledgment Issues

There are several ways an application setup can be inconsistent in terms of message acknowledgment.
You can configure the session acknowledgment for an application as:

* *IMMEDIATE*
* *AUTO*
* *MANUAL*
* *DUPS_OK*

When you set the session acknowledgment to *IMMEDIATE*, the message gets acknowledged as soon as it's received. Do not mix *IMMEDIATE* acknowledgment with *Ack* or *Recovery session* operations.

When you set the session acknowledgment to *AUTO*, the *On New Message* source takes control of the acknowledgment when the event finishes, or the session recovers when an error is thrown while processing the event. Adding a manual acknowledgment or session recover in an application with *AUTO* acknowledgment leads to duplicate operations on a channel.

When you set the session acknowledgment to either *MANUAL* or *DUPS_OK*, check that every path of the flow execution gets a message acknowledgment or a session recover. Otherwise, a message can leak and lead to an unresponsive consumer when the max depth of the unit of work is reached.

To resolve this issue:

Take a detailed look at the flow design and be sure that every message is acknowledged or the session recovers.

== Troubleshoot JMS Stopped Consuming Messages

Usually when JMS stopped consuming messages is related to a large number of unacknowledged messages. When your  Mule app that has an *On New Message* source or *Consume* operation with manual acknowledgement of messages, and not every path of the message has the proper acknowledgement or session recovery configuration, the Mule app can lead to an unresponsive consumer.

To resolve this error:

Check the depth of unacknowledged messages on the broker side and review the application logic.

== Troubleshoot Redeployment Errors When Using Binding Mode

When using binding mode for connections, the driver loads a JNI resource. Because the JNI resource can be loaded only once, when the application is redeployed, an error is thrown.

To resolve this error:

Add the driver dependency at the domain level, which enables application redeployment.

== Troubleshoot HA Environments and Durable Subscriptions

The configuration of HA (High Availability) systems consists of two components:

* Primary node +
Is the main node that provides continuous service.
* Secondary node +
Is a clone of the primary node and provides the same service.

Both nodes are identical and are ready to receive requests so the end-user is not aware of the system crash and can continue to use the system transparently.

However, when you work with durable subscriptions, only one node initializes a connection while the other node fails to do it. In these scenarios, the nodes are identical, but both of them cannot be ready at the same time. That's because one node has a connection while the other one doesn't. The current design of Mule running in HA clusters aims that all nodes initialize connections to ensure that they are capable of facing a failure of the primary node.

Because of these reasons, JMS Connector does not support durable ActiveMQ subscriptions in HA cluster environments.

To resolve this scenario:

Implement a fallback solution by managing the life cycle of containers to detect when the primary node fails and starts a new node.

== Understand Common Throws

Here is a list of common throw messages and how to interpret them.

* JMS:ACK

 There was an error in the context of the acknowledgment of an inflight message.

* JMS:CONNECTIVITY

 The connection is no longer valid. It is disposed of, but you can apply a reconnection policy if defined in the application setup.

* JMS:CONSUMING

 An error occurred while consuming messages from WMQ. This error might relate to the absence of a pending message.

* JMS:DESTINATION_NOT_FOUND

 JMS Connector is not able to find or create the destination.

* JMS:RETRY_EXHAUSTED

 The maximum number of retries for the operation is reached.

* JMS:SECURITY

 The thrown exception in due to of security-related errors.

* JMS:TIMEOUT

 The timeout for the requested operation is exceeded.

* JMS:ILLEGAL_BODY

 The message body is invalid or cannot be converted to a supported type.

* JMS:PUBLISHING

 There is an error while publishing to the target queue or topic.

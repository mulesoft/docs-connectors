= JMS Transport Reference
:page-aliases: 3.5@mule-runtime::jms-transport-reference.adoc

http://java.sun.com/products/jms/docs.html[JMS (Java Message Service)] is a widely-used API for http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Oriented_Middleware[Message Oriented Middleware]. It allows communication between different components of a distributed application to be loosely coupled, reliable, and asynchronous.

JMS supports two models for messaging:

* *Queues* - Point-to-point
* *Topics* - Publish and subscribe

Mule's JMS transport lets you easily send and receive messages to queues and topics for any message service which implements the JMS specification.

*Note*: The Mule JMS connector does not support a validateConnections attribute.

----

== Considerations

In the point-to-point or queuing model, a send posts messages to a particular queue and a receiver reads messages from the queue. Here, the sender knows the destination of the message and posts the message directly to the receiver's queue. It is characterized by the following:

* Only one consumer gets the message.
* The producer does not have to be running at the time the consumer consumes the message, nor does the consumer need to be running at the time the message is sent.
* Every message successfully processed is acknowledge by the consumer.

The publish/subscribe model supports publishing messages to a particular message topic. Subscribers may register interest in receiving messages on a particular message topic. In this model, neither the publisher nor the subscriber know about each other. A good analogy for the is an anonymous bulletin board. The following are characteristics of this model:

* Multiple consumers (or none) receive the message.
* There is a timing dependency between publishers and subscribers. The publisher has to create a message topic for clients to subscribe.
* The subscriber has to remain continuously active to receive messages, unless it has established a durable subscription. In that case, the messages published while the subscriber is not connected redistribute when it reconnects.

== Features

* Supports both versions of JMS specification: 1.0.2b and 1.1.
* Supports queues and topics, durable or non-durable subscriptions.
* ConnectionFactory and Queues/Topics can be looked up via JNDI.
* Supports local (JMS), distributed (XA), and multi-resource xref:3.5@mule-runtime::transaction-management.adoc[transactions] *Enterprise*
* Tested with a variety of JMS providers.
* Vendor-specific configuration available for popular providers.

[TIP]
====
*WebSphere MQ*

*Enterprise*

Mule Enterprise includes an xref:3.5@mule-runtime::mule-wmq-transport-reference.adoc[enhanced transport for WebSphere MQ] which is recommended if you are using WebSphere MQ as your JMS provider.
====

== Usage

=== Declaring the Namespace

To use the JMS transport, you must first declare the JMS namespace in the header of your Mule configuration file. You can then configure the JMS connector and endpoints.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
^|JMS Namespace
a|

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<mule ...cut...
   xmlns:jms="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/jms"
   xsi:schemaLocation=" ...cut...
     http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/jms http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/jms/3.5/mule-jms.xsd">
----
|===

=== Configuring the Connector

There are several attributes available on the connector, most of which are optional. Refer to the schema documentation below for complete information.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
^|Connector Attributes
a|

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:connector name="myConnector"
               acknowledgementMode="DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE"
               clientId="myClient"
               durable="true"
               noLocal="true"
               persistentDelivery="true"
               maxRedelivery="5"
               cacheJmsSessions="true"
               eagerConsumer="false"
               specification="1.1"
               numberOfConsumers="7"
               username="myuser"
               password="mypass" />
----
|===

=== Configuring the ConnectionFactory

One of the most important attributes is `connectionFactory-ref`. This is a reference to the ConnectionFactory object which will create new connections for your JMS provider. The object must implement the interface `javax.jms.ConnectionFactor`.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
^|ConnectionFactory
a|

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<spring:bean name="connectionFactory" class="com.foo.FooConnectionFactory"/>

<jms:connector name="jmsConnector1" connectionFactory-ref="connectionFactory" />
----
|===

There are also a few attributes which allow you to look up the ConnectionFactory from JNDI Context:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
^|ConnectionFactory from JNDI
a|

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:connector name="jmsConnector"
    jndiInitialFactory="com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory"
    jndiProviderUrl="ldap://localhost:10389/"
    jndiProviderProperties-ref="providerProperties"
    connectionFactoryJndiName="cn=ConnectionFactory,dc=example,dc=com" />
----
|===

[WARNING]
====
*JMS Performance*

For performance it is important to use the "Caching Connection Strategy" between you JMS Connector and the actual JMS ConnectionFactory implementation. For more information, see xref:index.adoc[Caching connection factory] below.
====

=== Configuring the Endpoints

==== Queues

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:inbound-endpoint queue="my.queue"/>
<jms:outbound-endpoint queue="my.queue"/>
----

==== Topics

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:inbound-endpoint topic="my.topic"/>
<jms:outbound-endpoint topic="my.topic"/>
----

By default, Mule's subscription to a topic in non-durable (that is, it only receives messages while connected to the topic). You can make topic subscriptions durable by setting the `durable` attribute on the connector.

When using a durable subscription, the JMS server requires a durable name to identify each subscriber. By default, Mule generates the durable name in the format `mule.<connector name>.<topic name>`. If you want to specify the durable name yourself, you can do so using the `durableName` attribute on the endpoint.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
^|Durable Topic
a|

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:connector name="jmsTopicConnector" durable="true"/>
<jms:inbound-endpoint topic="some.topic" durableName="sub1" />
<jms:inbound-endpoint topic="some.topic" durableName="sub2" />
<jms:inbound-endpoint topic="some.topic" durableName="sub3" />
----
|===

[NOTE]
====
*Number of Consumers*

In the case of a topic, the number of consumers on the endpoint is set to one. You can override this by setting `numberOfConcurrentTransactedReceivers` or `numberOfConsumers` on the connector.
====

=== Transformer

The default transformer applied to JMS endpoints are as follows:

inbound= [JMSMessageToObject

response= ObjectToJMSMessage

outbound= ObjectToJMSMessage

These automatically transform to/from the standard JMS message types:

[source,text,linenums]
----
javax.jms.TextMessage - java.lang.String
javax.jms.ObjectMessage - java.lang.Object
javax.jms.BytesMessage - byte[]
javax.jms.MapMessage - java.util.Map
javax.jms.StreamMessage - java.io.InputStream
----

== Looking Up JMS Objects from JNDI

If you have configured a JNDI context on the connector, you can also look up queues/topics via JNDI using the jndiDestinations attribute. If a queue/topic cannot be found via JNDI, its created using the existing JMS session unless you also set the `forceJndiDestinations` attribute.

There are two different ways to configure the JNDI settings:

. Using connector properties (deprecated):
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:connector name="jmsConnector"
    jndiInitialFactory="com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory"
    jndiProviderUrl="ldap://localhost:10389/"
    connectionFactoryJndiName="cn=ConnectionFactory,dc=example,dc=com"
    jndiDestinations="true"
    forceJndiDestinations="true"/>
----

. Using a `JndiNameResolver`. A `JndiNameResolver` defines a strategy for lookup objects by name using JNDI. The strategy contains a lookup method that receives a name and returns the object associated to that name.

At the moment, there are two simple implementations of that interface:

*SimpleJndiNameResolver*: Uses a JNDI context instance to search for the names. That instance is maintained opened during the full lifecycle of the name resolver.

*CachedJndiNameResolver*: Uses a simple cache in order to store previously resolved names. A JNDI context instance is created for each request that is sent to the JNDI server and then the instance is freed. The cache can be cleaned up restarting the name resolver.

Default JNDI name resolver example: Define the name resolver using the *default-jndi-name-resolver* tag and then add the appropriate properties to it.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:activemq-connector name="jmsConnector"
                            jndiDestinations="true"
                            connectionFactoryJndiName="ConnectionFactory">
        <jms:default-jndi-name-resolver
                jndiInitialFactory="org.apache.activemq.jndi.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory"
                jndiProviderUrl="vm://localhost?broker.persistent=false&amp;broker.useJmx=false"
                jndiProviderProperties-ref="providerProperties"/>
    </jms:activemq-connector>
----

*Custom JNDI name resolver example*: Define the name resolver using the `custom-jndi-name-resolver` tag, then add the appropriate property value using the Spring's property format.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:activemq-connector name="jmsConnector"
                            jndiDestinations="true"
                            connectionFactoryJndiName="ConnectionFactory">
        <jms:custom-jndi-name-resolver class="org.mule.transport.jms.jndi.CachedJndiNameResolver">
            <spring:property name="jndiInitialFactory" value="org.apache.activemq.jndi.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory"/>
            <spring:property name="jndiProviderUrl"
                             value="vm://localhost?broker.persistent=false&amp;broker.useJmx=false"/>
            <spring:property name="jndiProviderProperties" ref="providerProperties"/>
        </jms:custom-jndi-name-resolver>
    </jms:activemq-connector>
----

== Changes in JmsConnector

There are some property changes in the JmsConnector definition. Some properties are now deprecated as they should be defined in a JndiNameResolver and then using that JndiNameResolver in the JmsConnector.

Deprecated properties in JmsConnector:

* jndiContext
* jndiInitialFactory
* jndiProviderUrl
* jndiProviderProperties-ref

Added property:

* jndiNameResolver: Sets a proper JndiNameResolver. Can be set using the `default-jndi-name-resolver` or `custom-jndi-name-resolver` tags inside the JmsConnector definition.

== JMS Selectors

You can set a JMS selector as a filter on an inbound endpoint. The JMS selector simply sets the filter expression on the JMS consumer.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
^|JMS Selector
a|

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:inbound-endpoint queue="important.queue">
    <jms:selector expression="JMSPriority=9"/>
</jms:inbound-endpoint>
----
|===

== JMS Header Properties

Once a JMS message is received by Mule, the standard JMS headers such as `JMSCorrelationID` and `JMSRedelivered` are made available as properties on the MuleMessage object.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
^|Retrieving JMS Headers
a|

[source,text,linenums]
----
String corrId = (String) muleMessage.getProperty("JMSCorrelationID");
boolean redelivered =  muleMessage.getBooleanProperty("JMSRedelivered");
----
|===

You can access any custom header properties on the message in the same way.

== Configuring Transactional Polling (Enterprise)

The Enterprise version of the JMS transport can be configured for transactional polling using the `TransactedPollingJmsMessageReceiver`.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
^|Transactional Polling
a|

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:connector ...cut...>
     <service-overrides transactedMessageReceiver="com.mulesoft.mule.transport.jms.TransactedPollingJmsMessageReceiver" />
</jms:connector>

<jms:inbound-endpoint queue="my.queue">
     <properties>
          <spring:entry key="pollingFrequency" value="5000" /> ❶
     </properties>
</jms:inbound-endpoint>
----
|===

❶ Each receiver polls with a 5 second interval

== Disable Reply Message

When an incoming message has the `replyTo` property set, you may wish to disable the automatic reply message on a flow starting with a one-way JMS inbound endpoint. To do so, set the following variable anywhere in your flow to prevent Mule from automatically sending a response.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<set-variable variableName="MULE_REPLYTO_STOP" value="true" doc:name="Variable"/>
----

== Implementing Message Groups

Message groups provide ordering of related messages, load balancing across multiple consumers, and auto failover to other consumers if JVM goes down. Messages in a group deliver to the same consumer as long as it's available but switch to another consumer if the first goes away.

You can implement a message group by setting JMSGroupID property on the client producer (outbound endpoint) before sending it off. By default, all messages deliver in the same order as they arrive, but it's also possible to set the JMSXGroupSec property to control in which order different messages should be delivered.

An example in a flow is:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:outbound-endpoint queue="orders.car" connector-ref="amqConnector">
    <message-properties-transformer scope="outbound">
        <add-message-property key="JMSXGroupID" value="#[xpath://type]"/>
    </message-properties-transformer>
...
----

For more information, see https://blogs.mulesoft.com/dev/mule-dev/message-sequencing-with-mule-and-jms-message-groups/[Message Sequencing with Mule and JMS Message Groups].

== Modifying Message Properties

To modify the priority of a JMS message, set the `priority` key as the name of the property instead of using the `JMSpriority` key:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<message-properties-transformer doc:name="Message Properties">
    <add-message-property key="priority" value="6"/>
</message-properties-transformer>
----

This won't work:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<message-properties-transformer doc:name="Message Properties">
    <add-message-property key="JMSPriority" value="6"/>
</message-properties-transformer>
----

== Reference

=== JMS Transport

The JMS transport provides support for sending messages via JMS queues.

=== Connector

The connector element configures a generic connector for sending and receiving messages over JMS queues.

.Attributes of <connector...>
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|connectionFactory-ref |string |no |  |Reference to the connection factory, which is required for non-vendor JMS configurations.
|redeliveryHandlerFactory-ref |string |no |  |Reference to the redelivery handler.
|acknowledgementMode |enumeration |no |AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE |The acknowledgement mode to use: AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE, CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE, or DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE.
|clientId |string |no |  |The ID of the JMS client.
|durable |boolean |no |  |Whether to make all topic subscribers durable.
|noLocal |boolean |no |  |If set to true, a subscriber will not receive messages that were published by its own connection.
|persistentDelivery |boolean |no |  |If set to true, the JMS provider logs the message to stable storage as it is sent so that it can be recovered if delivery is unsuccessful. A client marks a message as persistent if it feels that the application will have problems if the message is lost in transit. A client marks a message as non-persistent if an occasional lost message is tolerable. Clients use delivery mode to tell a JMS provider how to balance message transport reliability/throughput. Delivery mode only covers the transport of the message to its destination. Retention of a message at the destination until its receipt is acknowledged is not guaranteed by a PERSISTENT delivery mode. Clients should assume that message retention policies are set administratively. Message retention policy governs the reliability of message delivery from destination to message consumer. For example, if a client's message storage space is exhausted, some messages as defined by a site specific message retention policy may be dropped. A message is guaranteed to be delivered once-and-only-once by a JMS Provider if the delivery mode of the message is persistent and if the destination has a sufficient message retention policy.
|honorQosHeaders |boolean |no |  |If set to true, the message's QoS headers are honored. If false (the default), the connector settings override the message headers.
|maxRedelivery |integer |no |  |The maximum number of times to try to redeliver a message. Use -1 to accept messages with any redelivery count.
|cacheJmsSessions |boolean |no |true |Whether to cache and re-use the JMS session and producer object instead of recreating them for each request. The default behavior is to cache JMS Sessions and Producers (previous to 3.6, the default behavior was to not cache them). NOTE: This is NOT supported with XA transactions or JMS 1.0.2b.
|eagerConsumer |boolean |no |  |Whether to create a consumer right when the connection is created instead of using lazy instantiation in the poll loop.
|specification |enumeration |no |1.0.2b |The JMS specification to use: 1.0.2b (the default) or 1.1
|username |string |no |  |The user name for the connection
|password |string |no |  |The password for the connection
|numberOfConsumers |integer |no |  |The number of concurrent consumers that will be used to receive JMS messages. (Note: If you use this attribute, you should not configure the 'numberOfConcurrentTransactedReceivers', which has the same effect.)
|jndiInitialFactory |string |no |  |The initial factory class to use when connecting to JNDI. DEPRECATED: use jndiNameResolver-ref properties to configure this value.
|jndiProviderUrl |string |no |  |The URL to use when connecting to JNDI. DEPRECATED: use jndiNameResolver-ref properties to configure this value.
|jndiProviderProperties-ref |string |no |  |Reference to a Map that contains additional provider properties. DEPRECATED: use jndiNameResolver-ref property to configure this value.
|connectionFactoryJndiName |string |no |  |The name to use when looking up the connection factory from JNDI.
|jndiDestinations |boolean |no |  |Set this attribute to true if you want to look up queues or topics from JNDI instead of creating them from the session.
|forceJndiDestinations |boolean |no |  |If set to true, Mule fails when a topic or queue cannot be retrieved from JNDI. If set to false, Mule will create a topic or queue from the JMS session if the JNDI lookup fails.
|disableTemporaryReplyToDestinations |boolean |no |  |If this is set to false (the default), when Mule performs request/response calls a temporary destination will automatically be set up to receive a response from the remote JMS call.
|embeddedMode |boolean |no |false |Some application servers, like WebSphere AS, don't allow certain methods to be called on JMS objects, effectively limiting available features. Embedded mode tells Mule to avoid those whenever possible. Default is false.

|durable |boolean |no |  |Whether to make all topic subscribers durable.
|noLocal |boolean |no |  |If set to true, a subscriber will not receive messages that were published by its own connection.
|persistentDelivery |boolean |no |  |If set to true, the JMS provider logs the message to stable storage as it is sent so that it can be recovered if delivery is unsuccessful. A client marks a message as persistent if it feels that the application will have problems if the message is lost in transit. A client marks a message as non-persistent if an occasional lost message is tolerable. Clients use delivery mode to tell a JMS provider how to balance message transport reliability/throughput. Delivery mode only covers the transport of the message to its destination. Retention of a message at the destination until its receipt is acknowledged is not guaranteed by a PERSISTENT delivery mode. Clients should assume that message retention policies are set administratively. Message retention policy governs the reliability of message delivery from destination to message consumer. For example, if a client's message storage space is exhausted, some messages as defined by a site specific message retention policy may be dropped. A message is guaranteed to be delivered once-and-only-once by a JMS Provider if the delivery mode of the message is persistent and if the destination has a sufficient message retention policy.
|honorQosHeaders |boolean |no |  |If set to true, the message's QoS headers are honored. If false (the default), the connector settings override the message headers.

|cacheJmsSessions |boolean |no |true |Whether to cache and re-use the JMS session and producer object instead of recreating them for each request. The default behavior is to cache JMS Sessions and Producers (previous to 3.6, the default behavior was to not cache them). NOTE: This is NOT supported with XA transactions or JMS 1.0.2b.
|eagerConsumer |boolean |no |  |Whether to create a consumer right when the connection is created instead of using lazy instantiation in the poll loop.

== Caching connection factory

DEPRECATED: This element is deprecated from Mule 3.6. This can still but used in 3.6, but it not necessary given that from Mule 3.6 JMS connections cache Sessions/Producers by default when a CachingConnectionFactory has not been configured explicitly.

|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|name |name (no spaces) |yes |  |Identifies the pool so that a connector can reference it.
|sessionCacheSize |integer |no |1 |Defines the maximum amount of connections that can be in the pool. NOTE: This cache size is the maximum limit for the number of cached Sessions per session acknowledgement type (auto, client, dups_ok, transacted). As a consequence, the actual number of cached Sessions may be up to four times as high as the specified value - in the unlikely case of mixing and matching different acknowledgement types.
|cacheProducers |boolean |no |true |Indicates whether to cache JMS MessageProducers for the JMS connection. Default is true
|connectionFactory-ref |name (no spaces) |yes |  |Reference to the connection factory
|username |string |no |  |The user name for the connection
|password |string |no |  |The password for the connection

== Notes

The JMS 1.0.2b specification has the limitation of only supporting queues or topics for each ConnectionFactory. If you need both, configure two separate connectors, one that references a `QueueConnectionFactory`, and another that references a `TopicConnectionFactory`. You can then use the `connector-ref` attribute to disambiguate the endpoints.

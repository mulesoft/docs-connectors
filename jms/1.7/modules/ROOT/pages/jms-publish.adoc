= Publish Messages Using the JMS Connector Examples
:keywords: jms, connector, publish
:page-aliases: connectors::jms/jms-publish.adoc

Anypoint Connector for JMS (JMS Connector) *Publish* operation enables you to create a new JMS message and send it to the specified destination, be it a queue or a topic. With the operation, you can configure not only the content of the message, but also all the headers that may be need.

== Publish a Message to a Queue

When you use the *Publish* operation in its default form, the connector publishes whatever is in the message payload to the specified queue. In the following example, you configure the operation to publish a message to a queue specified in the *Destination* field:

. In your Studio flow, select the *Publish* operation.
. Set the *Destination* field to the queue name, for example `invoiceQueue`.

.Publish operation configuration to a queue

In the XML editor, the `<jms:publish>` and `destination` configurations looks like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:publish destination="invoiceQueue" config-ref="JMS_config"/>
----

If the payload is not in the correct format, and you need to make a transformation, you could place a DataWeave transformation before the *Publish* operation, but that would cause the message payload to change and impact the operation placed after the operation.

To avoid this impact, place the DataWeave transformation inside the *Publish* operation. The transformation generates the content to publish without producing a side effect on the message in transit. In the following example, you configure the transformation inside the operation:

. In your Studio flow, select the *Publish* operation.
. Set the *Destination* field to the queue name, for example `invoiceQueue`.
. In the *Body* field, set the following DataWeave transformation:

[source,DataWeave,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/json
---
payload.payments
----

In the XML editor, the `<jms:body>` configuration looks like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:publish destination="invoiceQueue" config-ref="JMS_config">
  <jms:message>
    <jms:body>#[%dw 2.0
   output application/json
   ---
   payload.payments
   ]</jms:body>
  </jms:message>
</jms:publish>
----

== Publish a Message to a Topic

The *Publish* operation can also publish a message to a specified topic destination. All the configurations of the operation and the message are identical, you just need to configure the *Destination type* field to *TOPIC*.

In the following example, you configure the operation to publish a message to a topic destination:

. In your Studio flow, select the *Publish* operation.
. Set the *Destination* field to the queue name, for example `invoiceEvents`.
. Set the *Destination type* to *TOPIC*.

In the XML editor, the `<jms:publish>` and `destinationType` configurations looks like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:publish destination="invoiceEvents" destinationType="TOPIC" config-ref="JMS_config">
  <jms:message>
    <jms:body>#[%dw 2.0
   output application/json
   ---
   payload.payments
   ]</jms:body>
  </jms:message>
</jms:publish>
----

== Customize Message Delivery

Each JMS message has a set of headers that enables you to communicate metadata like the time to live, or the priority of the message.

=== Configure a Priority Queue

To configure a priority queue, set the *Priority* field to a value different than the default:

. In your Studio flow, select the *Publish* operation.
. Set the *Destination* field to the queue name, for example `priorityQueue`.
. Set the *Priority* field to `[attributes.queryParams.priority]`.

.Publish operation Priority configuration

In the XML editor, the `<jms:publish>` and `priority` configurations looks like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:publish priority="#[attributes.queryParams.priority]" destination="priorityQueue" config-ref="JMS_config"/>
----

=== Configure a Time To Live

Every JMS message published is sent with a time to live header that declares how long the message is available for someone to consume it before it evicts. In the *Publish* operation, configure the *Time to live* and *Time to live unit* fields:

. In your Studio flow, select the *Publish* operation.
. Set the *Destination* field to the queue name, for example `[vars.destination]`.
. Set the *Time to live* field to `[vars.timeToLive]`.
. Set the *Time to live unit* field to *SECONDS*.

.Publish operation Time to live configuration
image::jms-publish-config-5.png[In the Publish configuration screen, set a value for the Time to live field, and set the Time to live unit to SECONDS]

In the XML editor, the `timeToLive` and `timeToLiveUnit` configurations looks like this:


[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:publish  timeToLive="#[vars.timeToLive]" timeToLiveUnit="SECONDS"
              destination="#[vars.destination]" config-ref="JMS_config"/>
----

If you are using JMS 2.0 specification, you can also control the delivery delay of the message, which is how long to wait before making the message available to consumers. In the *Publish* operation, configure the *Delivery delay* and *Delivery delay unit* fields:

. In your Studio flow, select the *Publish* operation.
. Set the *Destination* field to the queue name, for example `[vars.destination]`.
. Set the *Delivery delay* field to `${msgInitialDelay}`.
. Set the *Delivery delay unit* field to *MILLISECONDS*.

.Publish operation Delivery Delay configuration
image::jms-publish-config-6.png[In the Publish configuration screen, set a value for the Delivery Delay field, and set the Delivery Delay Unit field to MILLISECONDS]

In the XML editor, the `deliveryDelay` and `deliveryDelayUnit` configurations looks like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:publish  deliveryDelay="${msgInitialDelay}" deliveryDelayUnit="MILLISECONDS"
              destination="#[vars.destination]" config-ref="JMS_config"/>
----


== Configure a Reply Destination

For the cases where you need an asynchronous reply to the message being sent, the *Publish* operation enables you to declare any reply-to destination in the *Reply to* field. The destination is communicated as a JMS header to the consumer of the message, and is the destination where to send the reply.

In the following example, you configure the reply-to destination:

. In your Studio flow, select the *Publish* operation.
. Set the *Destination* field to the queue name, for example `[vars.destination]`.
. Set the *Reply to* field to *Edit inline*.
. Set the *Destination name* field to `${completionEventsDestination}`.
. Set the *Destination type* field to *TOPIC*.

.Publish operation Reply To configuration
image::jms-publish-config-7.png[In the Publish configuration screen, set the Reply To to Edit inline, set a name for the Destination name field, and set the Destination type field to TOPIC]

In the XML editor, the `<jms:reply-to>`, `destination` and `destinationType` configurations looks like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:publish config-ref="JMS_config" destination="#[vars.invoceProcessorDestination]">
    <jms:message>
        <jms:reply-to destination="${completionEventsDestination}" destinationType="TOPIC"/>
    </jms:message>
</jms:publish>
----

== Configure the Correlation ID

The *Publish* operation enables you to configure a correlation ID for the outgoing message in the *Correlation ID* field.

First you need to configure wether or not you want to send the correlation ID when publishing the message. To do this configure the *Send correlation id* field to any of the following options:

* *ALWAYS* +
Always sends the header
 * *NEVER*
Never sends the header
 * *AUTO*
The default value, uses the application configuration

Then, you can either use the correlation ID of the event that is sending the Message, or you can configure your own custom correlation ID in the message builder:

. In your Studio flow, select the *Publish* operation.
. Set the *Destination* field to the queue name, for example `[attributes.headers.replyTo.destination]`.
. Set the *Send correlation id* field to *ALWAYS*.
. Set the *Correlation ID* field to `[attributes.headers.correlationId]`.

.Publish operation Correlation ID configuration
image::jms-publish-config-8.png[In the Publish configuration screen, set the Send correlation ID field to ALWAYS, and set the correlation ID field to your custom value]

In the XML editor, the `endCorrelationId` and `correlationId` configurations looks like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:publish config-ref="JMS_config" sendCorrelationId="ALWAYS" destination="#[attributes.headers.replyTo.destination]">
    <jms:message correlationId="#[attributes.headers.correlationId]"/>
</jms:publish>
----

== Configure Message Properties

Every JMS message can have a set of properties, which you can use in many different ways, like to provide compatibility with other messaging systems or create custom message selectors.
Some of these properties are well-known JMS standards, but others depend on the implementation or custom user configurations. The *Publish* operation enables you to configure all these properties directly in the message.

=== Configure User Properties

Whenever you need to set a property for an outgoing message, configure the *Properties* field in the message and do an inline declaration of a map using DataWeave:

. In your Studio flow, select the *Publish* operation.
. Set the *Destination* field to the queue name, for example `${bridgeDestination}`.
. Set the *Destination type* field to *TOPIC*.
. Set the *Body* field to `["bridged_" ++ payload]`.
. Set the *Properties* field to the following DataWeave code:

[source,DataWeave,linenums]
----
[{
    AUTH_TYPE: 'jwt',
    AUTH_TOKEN: attributes.queryParams.token
}]
----

.Publish operation Properties configuration
image::jms-publish-config-9.png[In the Publish configuration screen, set the Body and Properties field]

In the XML editor, the `<jms:body>` and `<jms:properties>` configurations looks like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:publish config-ref="JMS_config" destination="${bridgeDestination}" destinationType="TOPIC">
    <jms:message>
        <jms:body>#["bridged_" ++ payload]</jms:body>
        <jms:properties>#[{
            AUTH_TYPE: 'jwt',
            AUTH_TOKEN: attributes.queryParams.token
        }]</jms:properties>
    </jms:message>
</jms:publish>
----

=== Configure JMSX Properties

The JMSX properties are a set of well-known properties defined in the JMS spec, containing metadata regarding the message. In the following example, you configure these properties in the *JMSX Properties* field of the message:

. In your Studio flow, select the *Publish* operation.
. Set the *Destination* field to the queue name, for example `${bridgeDestination}`.
. Set the *Destination type* field to *TOPIC*.
. Set the *Body* field to `["bridged_" ++ payload]`.
. Set the *JMSX Properties* field to *Edit inline*.
. Set the *Jmsx group id* field to `[vars.currentGroup]`.
. Set the *Jmsx user id* field `${username}`.

.Publish operation JMSX Properties configuration
image::jms-publish-config-9.png[In the Publish configuration screen, set the JMSX Properties field to Edit Inline and set the Jmsx group id and Jmsx user id fields]

In the XML editor, the `<jms:jmsx-properties>`, `jmsxGroupID` amd `jmsxUserID` configurations looks like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:publish config-ref="JMS_config" destination="${bridgeDestination}" destinationType="TOPIC">
    <jms:message>
        <jms:body>#["bridged_" ++ payload]</jms:body>
        <jms:jmsx-properties jmsxGroupID="#[vars.currentGroup]" jmsxUserID="${username}"/>
    </jms:message>
</jms:publish>

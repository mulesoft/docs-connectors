== Select

Selects data from a database.

=== Attributes of <select...>

[%header,cols="5*"]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|config-ref |string |no |  |Defines the configuration parameters for the JDBC connection.
|source |string |no |  |The expression used to obtain the value used to calculate parameters. Default is empty, so parameters are calculated from the payload.
|target |string |no |#[payload] |The enricher expression used to enrich the current message with the result of the SQL processing.
|transactionalAction |transactionalActionType |no |JOIN_IF_POSSIBLE |Indicates how the message processor handles transactions.
|streaming |boolean |no |false |Indicates if result sets must be returned as an iterator or as a list of maps.
|fetchSize |integer |no |  |Indicates how many rows to fetch from the database when rows are read from a resultSet. This property is required when streaming is true; in that case a default value (10) is used.
|maxRows |integer |no |  |Sets the limit for the maximum number of rows that any ResultSet object generated by this message processor can contain for the given number. If the limit is exceeded, the excess rows are silently dropped.

== JDBC User-Defined Data Types (UDT)

Specify a user-defined JDBC data type to be used when passing one to a stored procedure call. If you need to use a UDT in a stored procedure, specify the data type in the database configuration in a child element `<db:data-type>` of the parent element `<db:data-types>`. The user-defined data type parameter name (`name`) and type id (`id`) must be specified as in the example below, and as a parameter of the stored procedure you call. Note JDBC type `STRUCT` is cast to a mapped Java class. There is no cast for a Java array to an SQL `ARRAY`.

= Using Anypoint Studio to Configure Database Connector 1.13 - Mule 4
:page-aliases: connectors::db/database-connector-studio.adoc

Anypoint Studio (Studio) editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.

To add and configure a connector in Studio:

. <<create-mule-project,Create a Mule project>>.
. <<add-connector-to-project,Add the connector to your Mule project>>.
. <<configure-input-source,Configure a source for the connector's flow>>.
. <<add-connector-operation,Add a connector operation to the flow>>.
. <<configure-global-element,Configure a global element for the connector>>.

When you run the connector, you can view the app log to check for problems, as described in <<view-app-log,View the App Log>>.


If you are new to configuring connectors in Studio, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-config-use-studio.adoc[Using Anypoint Studio to Configure a Connector]. If, after reading this topic, you need additional information about the connector fields, see the xref:database-documentation.adoc[Database Connector Reference].

[[create-mule-project]]
== Create a Mule Project

In Studio, create a new Mule project in which to add and configure the connector:

. In Studio, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
. Enter a name for your Mule project and click *Finish*.

[[add-connector-to-project]]
== Add the Connector to Your Mule Project

Add Database Connector to your Mule project to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location and to add the required dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In the *Add Dependencies to Project* window, type `database` in the search field.
. Click *Database Connector* in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.

[[configure-input-source]]
== Configure a Source

A source initiates a flow when a specified condition is met.
You can configure one of these input sources to use with Database Connector:

* *Database > On Table Row* +
Initiates a flow by selecting from a table at a regular interval and generates one message per obtained row
* *HTTP > Listener* +
Initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port
* *Scheduler* +
Initiates a flow when a time-based condition is met

For example, to configure an *On Table Row* source, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *Database > On Table Row*.
. Drag *On Table Row* to the Studio canvas.
. In the *On Table Row* configuration screen, optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. Click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of the source in the app.
. In the *Database Config* window, for *Connection* select any of the connection types to provide to this configuration:

* *Data Source Reference Connection*
* *Derby Connection*
* *Generic Connection*
* *Microsoft SQL Server Connection*
* *MySQL Connection*
* *Oracle Connection*

[start=6]
. On the *General* tab, specify the database connection information for the connector.
. On the *Transactions* tab, optionally specify the transaction isolation, or XA transactions, when connecting to the database.
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify connection pooling and reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified database.
. Click *OK* to close the window.
. In the *On Table Row* configuration screen, in *Table*, specify the name of the table to select from.

[[add-connector-operation]]
== Add a Connector Operation to the Flow

When you add a connector operation to your flow, you immediately define a specific operation for that connector to perform.

To add an operation for Database Connector, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *Database Connector* and then select the desired operation.
. Drag the operation onto the Studio canvas and to the right of the input source.

The following screenshot shows the Database Connector operations in the Mule Palette view of Anypoint Studio:

== Configure a Global Element for the Connector

When you configure a connector, it’s best to configure a global element that all instances of that connector in the app can use. Database Connector can connect to any database for which a JDBC driver is available. To make it easier to connect to the most popular databases (such as MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server), the connector includes a series of different connection types.

To configure the global element for Database Connector, follow these steps:

. Select the operation in the Studio canvas.
. In the configuration screen for the operation, click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to access the global element configuration fields.
. In the *Database Config* window, for *Connection* select any of the connection types to provide to this configuration:

* *Data Source Reference Connection*
* *Derby Connection*
* *Generic Connection*
* *Microsoft SQL Server Connection*
* *MySQL Connection*
* *Oracle Connection*

[start=4]
. On the *General* tab, specify the database connection information for the connector.
. On the *Transactions* tab, optionally specify the transaction isolation, or XA transactions, when connecting to the database.
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify connection pooling and reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified database.
. Click *OK*.

The following screenshot shows the Database Connector *Global Element Configuration* window in Anypoint Studio:

[[view-app-log]]
== View the App Log

To check for problems, you can view the app log as follows:

* If you’re running the app from Anypoint Platform, the output is visible in the Anypoint Studio console window.
* If you’re running the app using Mule from the command line, the app log is visible in your OS console.

Unless the log file path is customized in the app’s log file (`log4j2.xml`), you can also view the app log in the default location `MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`.

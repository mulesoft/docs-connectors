= Database Connector
:keywords: database connector, jdbc, anypoint studio, data base, connectors, mysql, stored procedure, sql, derby, oracle
:page-aliases: 3.9@mule-runtime::database-connector.adoc

The Database connector can connect to almost any Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) relational database and run SQL operations. You can specify MEL expressions in connector fields and configure attributes dynamically, depending on the  database configuration you use. An application can support multi-tenant scenarios using the same configuration element, changing the connection attributes based on, for example, information coming from each request.

You can perform predefined queries, dynamically constructed queries, and template queries that are self-sufficient and customizable. You can perform multiple SQL requests in a single bulk update and make Data Definition Language (DDL) requests that alter the data structure rather than the data itself. The Database connector is available with Mule Community and Mule Enterprise runtimes.

== Before You Begin

To complete the examples presented here, we assume that you have access to the database that you are to connect to, and that you have downloaded the proper database driver for your database. To use a Database connector in your Mule application, check whether your *database engine* is supported out-of-the-box. The database connector currently includes out of the box support for Oracle, MySQL and Derby engines. The Generic Database Configuration option supports all other database engines, including MS SQL and PostgreSQL.

== Basic Setup Steps

. Configure a *Database connector* where you define:
.. Your database's location and connection details
+
You may need to add your database driver as a dependency to your app for the connector to work.
+
.. Advanced connection parameters such as connection pooling
. Configure the operation:
.. Contains the query to perform on the database

*DataWeave* can extract message metadata and assist in transforming data to a different structure.

== Supported Operations

The database connector supports the following operations:

* *Select*
* *Insert*
* *Update*
* *Delete*
* *Stored Procedure*
* *Bulk Execute*
* *DDL operations* such as CREATE, ALTER, etc.

You can run a *TRUNCATE* query on the database by selecting *Update* as the operation. To enhance connector performance, verify whether your query is valid for use in Bulk Mode.


== Configuring Database Connector

Follow these steps to set up and test a connection to your database by creating a reusable *global element* for the database connector to reference.

. Click a database connector processor that you have included in your flow.
+
image::database-connector-56a11.png[]
+
You can use the *Poll* scope to monitor changes to your database and trigger subsequent actions.
+
. Select the type of *database global element* to configure by clicking the green plus sign and navigate the dropdown to the applicable database engine. Or edit an existing configuration by clicking the "Edit" icon.
+
image::add-db-config.png[add-db-config 1]
+
. Choose a type of database global element to set up.
+
image::choose-global-type.png[choose.global.type]
+
(Select *Generic Database Configuration* if yours is not listed if you are not using an out-of-the-box configuration, i.e. MySQL, Derby, Oracle)
+
. For MySQL database connection, you must fill out these fields in the *Global Element Properties* screen:

* *Host*
* *Port*
* *User*
* *Password*
* *Database*

. Specify the database engine driver on the Global Element Properties window. In this case, the *MySQL Connector/J* driver was retrieved from the following URL:
+
`+http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/+`.
+
image::database-connector-380c4.png[db config props]

. At this point, the database connection should be confirmed via *Test Connection* button. Click *OK* when confirmed.
. Back in the properties window ensure a valid operation and query have been specified for the database connector processors before running your app.

|*Use XA Transactions*
|Enable to indicate that the created datasource must support extended architecture (XA) transactions.
|*Connection Timeout*
|Maximum time in seconds that this data source will wait while attempting to connect to a database. A value of zero specifies that the timeout is the default system timeout if there is one; otherwise, it specifies that there is no timeout.
|*Transaction isolation* |Define database read issue levels.
|*Driver Class Name* |The fully qualified name of the database driver class.

* Max Pool Size
* Min Pool Size
* Acquire Increment
* Prepared Statement Cache Size
* Max Wait Millis

See notes below.
|===

*Connection Pooling Notes:*

* The default configuration doesn't use a pool. The database connector makes use of org.enhydra.jdbc.standard.StandardDataSource. Example of a default configuration:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<db:mysql-config name="dbConfig" host="localhost" port="3306" user="root"
    password="" database="esb" doc:name="MySQL Configuration" />
----
+
This means that every execution of an SQL command opens a new connection and closes it once finished.
* To configure a pool, for example for MySQL:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<db:mysql-config name="dbConfig" host="localhost" port="3306" user="root"
    password="" database="esb" doc:name="MySQL Configuration">
    <db:pooling-profile maxPoolSize="17" minPoolSize="13" />
</db:mysql-config>
----
+
Alternatively, you can reference a specific pooling library from a generic DB configuration:
+
Example for MySQL and Apache DB pool:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<spring:bean id="jdbcDataSource" class="org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource"
        destroy-method="close">
    <spring:property name="driverClassName" value="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver" />
    <spring:property name="url" value="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/esb?user=root&amp;password=" />
    <spring:property name="maxActive" value="17" />
</spring:bean>
<db:generic-config name="dbConfig" dataSource-ref="jdbcDataSource"
    doc:name="Generic Database Configuration"  />
----
+
This does not close the connections after each operation, but returns the connections to the pool. It's the pool's responsibility if, when, and how they're closed.

=== Configuring for Database Engines Not Supported Out of the Box

All databases that are not configured <<config-out-of-box,Database Engines Supported Out of the Box>> must be added through the generic database installation, and then configured accordingly.

==== Adding a Generic Database Driver

When using the *Generic* Database Configuration, you manually import the driver for your database engine into your application as a referenced library, or preferably add it as a Maven dependency. Remember to later specify the fully qualified driver class as one of the connection parameters in the connector configuration. You can use the database connector with any database engine for which you have a driver.

To install the database driver for a generic installation, follow the steps below.

[.ex]
=====
[discrete.view]
=== Studio Visual Editor

. If you haven't already done so, download the driver for your particular database. For example, the driver for a MySQL database is available to http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/[Download online].
. Drag and drop the driver *.jar* file from your local drive to the root folder in your project or add the *.jar* file to the build path of your project via the wizard by right-clicking the project name, selecting *Build Path* > *Configure Build Path…*.
. In the wizard that appears, click the *Libraries* tab, then click *Add Jars…* (or *Add External Jars…*, depending on its location.
. Click *OK* to save, then *OK* to exit the wizard. If referencing an external *.jar*, notice that your project now has a new folder named *Referenced Libraries* in which your database driver *.jar* resides.

image::referenced-libraries-in-proj.png[referenced-libraries-in-proj pack_explorer]

[discrete.view]
=== XML Editor

. If you haven't already done so, download the driver for your particular database. For example, the driver for a MySQL database is available for http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/[download] online.
. Add the driver's *.jar* file to the root folder  in your project. In Studio, you can drag and drop the file from your local drive into the project folder.
. Add the *.jar* file to the build path of your project.

=====

After adding the database driver for a database engine not supported out of the box, you need to enter the fully qualified name of the driver class in the global element referenced by the database connector. For details, see the next section.

== Setting up Database Connector Operation

*Required:* The following table describes the attributes of the Database Connector element that you _must_ configure in order to be able to connect, then submit queries to a database. For a full list of elements, attributes, and default values, consult the xref:database-connector-reference.adoc[Database Connector Reference]. See also <<Fields That Support MEL Expressions, Fields That Support MEL Expressions>>.

The Oracle and Derby databases are supported by Mule, but you can only configure operations for these databases using Studio's XML Editor, not using Studio's Visual Editor.


[%header,cols="30,70"]
|===
|*Required Attribute* a|*Use*
|*Display Name* |Use to define a unique identifier for the Database Connector element in your flow.
|*Config Reference* |Use to identify the global database connector element to which the Database Connector refers for connection details, among other things. |*Operation* a|Use to instruct the Database Connector to submit a request to perform a specific query in the database:

* Select
* Insert
* Update
* Delete
* Stored Procedure
* Bulk Execute
* Execute DDL

Run a TRUNCATE query by selecting *Update* as the operation.


a|*SQL Statement*
_OR_
*Template Query Reference* |If you chose to use a *Parameterized* or *Dynamic* query type, you still need to define the SQL statement itself in the connector's general settings.
If you choose to use a *From Template* query type, reference the template (defined in a global Template Query element) in which you defined a SQL statement.
|===


=== Select and Stored Procedure - Advanced Tab Fields

* *Max Rows* (_applies to SELECT_) - Use to define the maximum number of rows your application accepts in a response from a database.
* *Fetch Size* - Indicates how many rows should be fetched from the resultSet. This property is required when streaming is true, the default value is 10.
* *Streaming* - Enable to facilitate streaming content through the Database Connector to the database. Mule reads data from the database in chunks of records instead of loading the full result set into memory.

=== INSERT - Advanced Tab Fields

* *Auto-generated Keys* - Use this attribute to indicate that auto-generated keys should be made available for retrieval.
* *Auto-generated Keys Column Indexes* - Provide a comma-separated list of column indexes that indicates which auto-generated keys should be made available for retrieval.
* *Auto-generated Keys Column Names* - Provide a comma-separated list of column names that indicates which auto-generated keys should be made available for retrieval.

=== Query Types

Mule makes available three types of queries you can use to execute queries to your database from within an application. The following table describes the three types of queries, and the advantages of using each.

[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|*Query Type/Description* |*Advantages*
|*Parameterized*
_(Recommended)_ - Mule replaces all Mule Expression Language (MEL) expressions inside a query with "?" to create a prepared statement, then evaluates the MEL expressions using the current event so as to obtain the value for each parameter.

Refer to the <<Notes>> section for tips on writing parameterized query statements.

|Relative to dynamic queries, parameterized queries offer the following advantages:

* Security - using parameterized query statements prevents SQL injection
* Performance - where queries are executed multiple times, using parameterized query facilitates faster repetitions of statement execution
* Type-management: using parameterized query allows the database driver to automatically manage the types of variables designated as parameters, and, for some types, provides automatic type conversion.
For example, in the statement *insert into employees where name = \#[message.payload.name]* Mule maps the value for *#[message.payload.name]* to the type of variable of the *name* column in the database. Furthermore, you do not need to add quotations within statements, such as ‘3’ instead of 3, or ‘string’ instead of string.
|*Dynamic* - Mule replaces all MEL expressions in the query with the result of the expression evaluation, then sends the result to the database. As such, you are responsible for making sure that any string in your query statement is interpretable by the database (such as quoting strings, data formatting, etc.)

The most important disadvantage of using dynamic query statements is security as it leaves the statement open for SQL injection, potentially compromising the data in your database. This risk can be mitigated by for example adding filters on your flow before the DB connector.
|
Relative to parameterized queries, dynamic queries offer the following advantages:

* flexibility - you have ultimate flexibility over the SQL statement. For example, all of the following are valid dynamic query statements:
** *select * from #[tablename] where id = 1;*
** *insert into #[message.payload.restOfInsertStatement];*
** *#[flowVars[‘deleteStatement’]]*
* performance - if a statement is executed only once, Mule can execute a dynamic SQL slightly faster relative to a parameterized query statement
|*From Template* - Enables you to define a query statement once, in a global element in your application (global Template Query Reference element), then reuse the query multiple times within the same application, dynamically varying specific values as needed. |
Relative to parameterized and dynamic queries, from template queries offer the advantage of enabling you to reuse your query statements.

For example, you can define a parameter in your query statement within the template (within the global Template Query Reference element), then, using the query statement in a Database Connector in your flow, instruct Mule to replace the value of the parameter with a value defined within the Database Connector. Read more about how to configure this query type below.
|===

=== Configuring a Query From a Template

You can use a *template* to pre-define an SQL query that you can use and reuse in your application's flows. This SQL query may contain variable parameters, whose values are inherited from database connector elements that you specify. An SQL template can contain a parameterized or a dynamic SQL query.

To utilize the *From Template* query type, you must first define the template as a global element, then reference the template from within the database connector in your flow.

The following steps describe how to configure your database connector to use a query statement from a template.

[.ex]
=====
[discrete.view]
=== Studio Visual Editor

. From within the *Properties Editor* of the *Database Connector* element in your flow, use the dropdown next to *Type* to select *From Template*.
. Click the plus sign next to the *Template Query Reference* field to create a new *Global Template Query Reference* element (see image, below).
+
image::add-template-query-reference.png[]
+
. Studio displays the *Global Element Properties* window, shown below. Provide a *Name* for your global element, then select a query type, either *Parameterized* or *Dynamic*.
+
image::template-query-reference-new.png[]
+
. Use the radio buttons to choose the method by which you wish to define the query statement: define it inline, or define from a file.
. Write your SQL query, which can optionally include variables. If you include a variable, reference it by prepending its name with a colon (:) as in *:myvar*.
. Use the plus sign next to *Input Parameters* to create the variable, assign its default value and optionally select the data type.
. Click *OK* to save your template and return to the Properties Editor of the Database Connector in your flow. Studio auto-populates the value of the *Template Query Reference* field with the name of the global template element you just created.
. You can optionally add variables and values to the *Input Parameters* section of the database connector. These variables and their values are valid for _all_ SQL templates. If a variable has been defined here and also in an individual template, then the value specified here takes precedence. In the image below, the variable *value* has a value of *100*. This value is valid for any defined templates (which you can see in the drop-down menu) that reference the variable.
+
image::global-var.png[global_var]
+
. Click the blank space in the Studio canvas to save your changes.

[discrete]
===== Example of Parameterized Query Using Variables

image::template-with-vars.png[template_with_vars]

In the image above, the parameterized query inserts the values referenced by variables *:ename*, *:hdate* and *:dept*. The names and values of these variables are set in the *Input parameters* section below the SQL query. Note that MEL expressions are allowed as values, as in the case of the *:hdate* field, which retrieves a date stored in a flow variable.

For each variable, the database connector automatically determines and sets the data type for inserting into the database; however, if type resolution fails, you can manually select the data type by clicking in the *Type* row for the variable. Studio displays a drop-down menu with data types, as shown below.

image::datatypes-menu.png[datatypes_menu]

If the desired data type is not listed, simply type it into the empty field.

[discrete.view]
=== XML Editor or Standalone

. At the top of your project's XML config file, above all flows, add a  *db:template-query* element. Configure the attributes of the element according to the code sample below.
. To the *db:template-query* element, add one of the following child elements, according to the type of query you wish to write: *db:parameterized-query* or *db:dynamic-query*. Configure the attribute of the child element in order to define your SQL statement. The statement may include *named variables* whose values can be dynamically replaced by values defined in individual Database Connector elements. To create a named variable, prepend your desired variable name with a colon (*:*).  For example, to create a named variable for *ID*, use *:id* in the query statement of your template. Use the *db:in-param* child element to define a default value of your named variable, if you wish.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<db:template-query name="Template_Query" doc:name="Template Query">
   <db:parameterized-query><![CDATA[insert into simpleemp values (id)]]></db:parameterized-query>
   <db:in-param name="id" defaultValue="2"/>
</db:template-query>
----
+
. In the Database connector in your Mule flow, define the values for the variables in your query statement that Mule should use at runtime when executing the query from the template. In other words, define the values you want to use to replace the default value for any variable that you defined within your template query statement.

   <db:in-param name="hdate" defaultValue="#[flowVar['tdate']]"/>
   <db:in-param name="dept" defaultValue="PR"/>
</db:template-query>
----

In the code above, the parameterized query inserts the values referenced by variables for employer name *:ename*, hire date *:hdate* and *:dept*. The names and values of these variables are defined by *in-param* child elements. Note that MEL expressions are allowed as values, as in the case of the *:hdate* field, which retrieves a date stored in a flow variable.

For each variable, the database connector automatically determines and sets the data type for inserting into the database; however, you can also manually define the data type by using the *type* attribute as shown below.

[source,xml]

      ...
<db:in-param name="value" defaultValue="#[flowVar['price']]" type="MONEY"/>

=== Execute DDL

Data Definition Language (DDL) is a subset of SQL that serves for manipulating the data structure rather than the data itself. This kind of request is used to create, alter, or drop tables.

When using DDL, you can only make dynamic queries (which may or may not have MEL expressions). The following are *not supported*:

* parameterized-query
* bulkMode
* in-params
* templates

[[bulk-mode]]
=== Bulk Mode

The Database Connector can consolidate multiple SQL statements into one through *Bulk Mode*. Enable this optional feature to INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE data with one query, as opposed to executing one query for every parameter set in a collection. The return type from a bulk mode operation is an update count, not actual data from the database.

==== Notes

* Bulk mode improves the performance of your applications as it reduces the number of individual query executions your application triggers.
* Bulk mode for a parameterized query requires at least one parameter. For a dynamic query requires at least one expression.
* The only memory constraints on this are imposed by the JVM, though some database drivers may have constraints on the number of parameters you can use on a bulk update.
* The individual SQL statements must be separated by semicolons, and line break characters. All queries must be dynamic. You may include MEL expressions.
* Instead of writing a statement in the editor, you can reference a file that contains multiple statements that are separated by semicolons and line breaks.
* if the amount of data is large, to avoid out of memory error use a Batch Commit approach with segmented Inserts in Bulk Mode. You must adjust the size of each commit to avoid memory issues.


For example, imagine you have a query to insert employees into a database table. For each employee, it must insert a last name and an ID. If you enable bulk mode, the Database Connector executes one query to the database to insert the values, rather than once per employee.

== Fields That Support MEL Expressions

In Mule version 3.7 and later, the following connector fields support MEL expressions. For a usage example, see <<Example MEL Expression for Database URL, Example MEL Expression for Database URL>>.


[%header,cols="4*"]
|===
|*Generic* |*Derby* |*Oracle* |*MySQL*
|`url` |`user` |`user` |`user`
|`driverClassName` |`password` |`password` |`password`

|- |`driverClassName` |`instance` |`host`
|- |Properties inside `connection-properties` element |`url` |`url`
|- |- |`driverClassName` |`driverClassName`
|- |- |Properties inside `connection-properties` element |Properties inside `connection-properties` element
|===

== About Installing the Database Driver

Be sure to install the *.jar* file for your database driver in your Mule project, then configure the build path of the project to include the *.jar* as a referenced library.

== Inserting Data Drawn From A Saas Provider Into A Database

Within your query statement, be sure to prepend input values with a "?" to ensure that a query can return NULL values for empty fields instead of returning an error. For example, the query statement below uses information pulled from Salesforce fields BillingCity, BillingCountry, OwnerId, and Phone to populate a table in a database. If the value of any of those fields is blank in Salesforce, such an insert statement would return an error.

----
insert into accounts values (#[message.payload.BillingCity], #[message.payload.BillingCountry], #[message.payload.OwnerId], #[message.payload.Phone])
----

However, if you manipulate the statement to include "?"s, then the insert statement succeeds, simply inserting NULL into the database table wherever the value of the Salesforce field was blank.

[source,text,linenums]
----
insert into accounts values (#[message.payload.?BillingCity], #[message.payload.?BillingCountry], #[message.payload.?OwnerId], #[message.payload.?Phone])
----

== Automatically Adding a Parameter for MySQL Database Connections

In this release of Mule, be aware that the global database connector element for MySQL automatically adds a parameter to the connection details to facilitate DataSense's ability to extract information about the data structure and format. The parameter is:  *generateSimpleParameterMetadata = true* This driver returns "*string*" as the type for each input parameter (such as could not be the real parameter type).


== Avoiding Complex MEL Expressions in SQL Statements

Because DataSense infers data structure based upon the query statement in a Database Connector, avoid using complex MEL expressions in the query statement, such as MEL expressions that involve functions. DataSense is only able to detect data structure from simple MEL expressions such as *\#[payload.BillingCity]*, not *#[payload.get(0)]*.  If the latter, DataSense can only indicate to DataWeave that the structure of the data it is to receive or send is "unknown".


== Enclosing Named Variables in Quotes

Variables in parameterized query statements should _not_ be enclosed in quotes. For example, a user should specify:

[source,sql]
----
select * from emp where id = #[payload.id]
----


== Streaming With the Database Connector

When you enable streaming on your Database connector, you leave the connection, statement, and result set open after execution. Mule closes these resources when either of the following occurs:

** The result iterator is consumed.
** There is an exception during the processing of the message (when the result iterator is in the payload of the current message).
** You enclose the select operation, and the message processors using the iterator, inside a transactional scope. The transactional scrope closes the transaction and there is no need to consume the iterator.

Trying to consume the iterator after closing the transaction causes an error.

== JDBC User-Defined Data Types

In Mule 3.6 and later, you can use user-defined data types with the Database connector. This feature provides the ability to use JDBC supported types in a query; for example, array, struct, and other types.

To use a JDBC data type, specify the type in the database configuration by the name of the type, along with type ID corresponding to the structured data type.

See the xref:database-connector-reference.adoc#jdbc-user-defined-data-types-udt[list of supported types].

Here in the example below you can see `java.sql.STRUCT` is referenced using ID of 2002, and `java.sql.ARRAY` as 2003:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<db:oracle-config name="dbConfig" url="..." user="..." password="...">
    <db:data-types>
         <db:data-type name="CONTACT_DETAILS" id="2002"/>
         <db:data-type name="CONTACT_DETAILS_ARRAY" id="2003"/>
 </db:data-types>
</db:oracle-config>
----

=== Struct Type

If you created a type in your database using the syntax `CREATE TYPE xyz AS OBJECT` you have created a struct. The database connector understands this as `java.sql.Struct`. In order to obtain the information about the struct, use MEL to invoke the `getAttributes` method of this Java type.

=== Array Type

For array values, the connector returns `java.sql.Array`. In order to obtain the corresponding Java array, invoke the `getArray` method on the `java.sql.Array` instance. This requires an open connection to the database, which means that the query returning the array must be executed inside a xref:3.9@mule-runtime::transactional.adoc[transactional scope] or using streaming, checking the box in the connector properties pane.

The value returned in a result set can be used as an input value in another query. You can mine into the result set using MEL and or the For Each component. For example, this MEL expression, `#[payload[0]['resultsetID']]` would give the first row. Omit the `[0]` index to get the whole result set.

=== Passing User-Defined Data Types to Stored Procedure

To pass a user-defined data type to a stored procedure, the data type should be specified in the database configuration with a number `id` identifying the xref:database-connector-reference.adoc#jdbc-user-defined-data-types-udt[JDBC type] it conforms to. The parameter you pass to the stored procedure should be referenced by the name of the data type:

            <db:out-param name="OUTtypename" />

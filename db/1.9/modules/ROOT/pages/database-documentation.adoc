== Configurations
---
[[config]]
=== Default Configuration


Use these parameters to configure the default configuration.


==== Parameters
[%header,cols="20s,20a,35a,20a,5a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x
| Connection a| * <<config_data-source, Data Source Reference Connection>>
* <<config_derby, Derby Connection>>
* <<config_generic, Generic Connection>>
* <<config_mssql, Microsoft SQL Server Connection>>
* <<config_my-sql, MySQL Connection>>
* <<config_oracle, Oracle Connection>>
 | The connection types to provide to this configuration. | | x
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before Mule considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform expires the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. Mule purges the instances as appropriate. |  |
|===

==== Connection Types
[[config_data-source]]
===== Data Source Reference Connection


Configure the connection provider implementation that creates database connections from a referenced data source. +

When you use a _provider's custom type_ in a Data Source Reference Connection, define the type inside the *Column Types* form of the Advanced section in the Database config. +
As an example, for Oracle DB checkout their Constant Field Values page (section oracle.jdbc.OracleTypes) for the correct id/type name combination.

=== Working with Pooling Profiles
When working with pooling profiles and the *Select* operation, the connection remains open until the flow execution ends or the content of the streams are consumed completely, or if the connection is the transaction key. This behavior occurs because the resultset the operation generates can have a stream or be part of an ongoing transaction.


==== Throws

* DB:BAD_SQL_SYNTAX
* DB:CONNECTIVITY
* DB:QUERY_EXECUTION

[[querySingle]]
=== Query Single
`<db:query-single>`


This operation selects a single data record from a database. If you provide an SQL query that returns more than one row, then only the first record is processed and returned. This operation does not use streaming, which means that immediately after performing the Query Single operation, the complete content of the selected record is loaded into memory.

=== Working with Pooling Profiles

When working with pooling profiles and the *Stored procedure* operation, the connection remains open until the flow execution ends or the content of the streams are consumed completely, or if the connection is the transaction key. This behavior occurs because the resultset the operation generates can have a stream or be part of an ongoing transaction.

== Sources

[[listener]]
=== On Table Row
`<db:listener>`


This operation selects from a table at a regular interval and generates one message per obtained row.  Optionally, you can provide watermark and ID columns. If a watermark column is provided, the values taken from that column are used to filter the contents of the next poll, so that only rows with a greater watermark value are returned. If an ID column is provided, this component automatically verifies that the same row is not picked twice by concurrent polls.

This operation does not support streaming, meaning that there is no need to perform additional transformations to the payload in order to access the operation results. This behavior is identical to the the *Query Single* operation released in version 1.9.

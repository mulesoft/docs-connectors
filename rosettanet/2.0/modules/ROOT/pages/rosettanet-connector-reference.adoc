|===

[non-repeatable-stream]
=== Non-repeatable Stream

Disables the repeatable stream functionality and uses non-repeatable streams to have less performance overhead, memory use, and cost.

[[reconnect]]
=== Reconnect

Configures a standard reconnection strategy, which specifies how often to reconnect and how many reconnection attempts the connector source or operation can make.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Frequency a| Number | How often in milliseconds to reconnect. | |
| Count a| Number | How many reconnection attempts to make. | |
| blocking |Boolean |If `false`, the reconnection strategy runs in a separate, non-blocking thread. |`true` |

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Frequency a| Number | How often in milliseconds to reconnect. | |
| blocking |Boolean |If false, the reconnection strategy runs in a separate, non-blocking thread. |`true` |

| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Redelivery Count a| Number | Maximum number of times that a message can be redelivered and processed unsuccessfully before triggering a `process-failed-message`. |  |
| Use Secure Hash a| Boolean | Whether to use a secure hash algorithm to identify a redelivered message. |  |

|===

[[repeatable-file-store-stream]]
=== Repeatable File Store Stream

Configures the repeatable file-store streaming strategy by which Mule keeps a portion of the stream content in memory. If the stream content is larger than the configured buffer size, Mule backs up the buffer’s content to disk and then clears the memory.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max In Memory Size a| Number a| Maximum amount of memory that the stream can use for data. If the amount of memory exceeds this value, Mule buffers the content to disk. To optimize performance:

* Configure a larger buffer size to avoid the number of times Mule needs to write the buffer on disk. This increases performance, but it also limits the number of concurrent requests your application can process, because it requires additional memory.
* Configure a smaller buffer size to decrease memory load at the expense of response time. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | Unit for *Max In Memory Size*. |  |
|===

[[repeatable-in-memory-stream]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Stream

Configures the in-memory streaming strategy by which the request fails if the data exceeds the maximum buffer size. Always run performance tests to find the optimal buffer size for your specific use case.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | Initial amount of memory to allocate to the data stream. If the streamed data exceeds this value, the buffer expands by *Buffer Size Increment*, with an upper limit of *Max Buffer Size* value. |  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | Amount by which the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of `0` or lower specifies that the buffer can't expand.|  |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | Maximum size of the buffer. If the buffer size exceeds this value, Mule raises a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error. A value of less than or equal to `0` means no limit.|  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | Unit for the *Initial Buffer Size*, *Buffer Size Increment*, and *Max Buffer Size* fields. |  |
|===

[[ReplyAttributes]]
=== Reply Attributes

Configures the values used when generating an action message in reply to another action.

| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Message Id a| String | Identifier of the message associated with the reponse. |  | x
| Action Id a| String | Identifier that indicates the type of respone. |  | x
| Pip Instance Id a| String | Identifier associated with an instance of a PIP. |  | x

Anypoint Connector for Salesforce Composite (Salesforce Composite Connector) provides you a way to integrate with Salesforce Composite API https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/resources_composite.htm[Salesforce Composite API]. The connector exposes convenient methods for preparing sub-requests, execute them in one batch and parse the results. Also it offers the posibillity of creating SObject Trees through an operation separate from the batch ones, called "createSobjectTree". It provides xref:3.6@mule-runtime::datasense.adoc[DataSense] on both preparation of sub-requests and parsing response of their execution and on the creation of the SObject Trees.

Read through this User Guide to understand how to set up and configure a basic integration flow using the connector. Read through the http://mulesoft.github.io/mule3-salesforce-composite-connector/[Technical Reference] to understand how the connector operations tie in with the Salesforce Composite API calls. You will also find *demo applications* here that illustrate how to use the connector operations.

*Release Notes*: xref:release-notes::connector/salesforce-composite-connector-release-notes.adoc[Salesforce Composite Connector Release Notes].

== Prerequisites

This document assumes you are familiar with Mule, xref:3.7@mule-runtime::anypoint-connectors.adoc[Anypoint Connectors], and xref:6@studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio Essentials] To increase your familiarity with Studio, consider completing one or more xref:6@studio::basic-studio-tutorial.adoc[Anypoint Studio Tutorials]. Further, this page assumes that you have a basic understanding of xref:3.7@mule-runtime::elements-in-a-mule-flow.adoc[Mule flows] and xref:3.7@mule-runtime::global-elements.adoc[Mule Global Elements].

== Requirements

To use the Salesforce Composite connector, you need:

* You must have a regular Salesforce account. For more information see https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/[Salesforce Rest API] and https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/using_composite_resources.htm[Salesforce Composite API Developer's Guide].
* To have downloaded and installed http://www.mulesoft.org/download-mule-esb-community-edition[Anypoint Studio Community edition] on your computer.

== Compatibility

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Application/Service |Version
|Mule Runtime | 3.5.0 and higher
|Salesforce Rest API | 36.0
|===

== Installing and Configuring

=== Installing

You can install a connector in Anypoint Studio using the instructions in xref:6@studio::import-asset-exchange-task.adoc[To Import an Asset from Exchange].

=== Using the Connector in a New Project

To use the Salesforce Composite connector in a Mule application project:

. In Studio, select *File* > *New* > *Mule Project*.
+
image::new-project.png[Create new project]
+
. Enter a name for your new project and leave the remaining options with their default values.
+
image::new-project-dialog.png[Create new project dialog box]
+
. If you plan to use Git, select *Create a default .gitignore file* for the project with default .gitignore settings for Studio Projects, and then click *Next*.
. Click *Finish* to create the project.

=== Configuring the Global Element

To use the Salesforce Composite connector in your Mule application, you must configure a global Salesforce Composite element that can be used by all the Salesforce Composite connectors in the application (read more about xref:3.7@mule-runtime::global-elements.adoc[global elements]).

=== Connector Authentication

To access the data in a Salesforce Composite instance, the connector uses "OAuth 2.0 Username-Password" flow. For more on how to obtain an access token with this method from Salesforce see: https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=remoteaccess_oauth_username_password_flow.htm&language=en_US[OAuth 2.0 Username-Password]. Below are the steps for configuring global element using it:

. Click the *Global Elements* tab at the base of the canvas.
. On the Global Mule Configuration Elements screen, click *Create*.
. In the Choose Global Type wizard, filter by "salesforce composite", expand *Connector Configuration*, and then select "Salesforce Composite: Configuration".
+
image::create-global-element.png[Create global element]
+
. Click *Ok*
. Enter the global element properties:
+
image::basic-authentication-config.png[Basic authentication configuration]
+
NOTE: In the image above, the placeholder values refer to a configuration file placed in the *src* folder of your project (Learn how to xref:3.7@mule-runtime::configuring-properties.adoc[configure properties]). You can either hardcode your credentials into the global configuration properties, or reference a configuration file that contains these values. For simpler maintenance and better re-usability of your project, Mule recommends that you use a configuration file. Keeping these values in a separate file is useful if you need to deploy to different environments, such as production, development, and QA, where your access credentials differ. See xref:3.7@mule-runtime::deploying-to-multiple-environments.adoc[Deploying to Multiple Environments] for instructions on how to manage this.

=== Using the Connector

You can use the Salesforce Composite connector as an outbound connector in your flow to push data into Salesforce system by taking advantage of composite resource which is part of Salesforce REST Api. To use it as an outbound connector, simply place the connector in your flow at any point after an inbound endpoint.

=== Use cases

The purpose of this connector is to let you take advantage of composite resource of Salesforce REST API. It comes to you with operations that have xref:3.6@mule-runtime::datasense.adoc[DataSense] support in order to give you the best user experience in preparing sub-requests that are going to be executed in one batch and also for parsing the responses that come from Salesforce.
You have one operation for each resource supported by composite for preparing the sub-request that Salesforce Composite API expects, named "Pre <name_of_resource>", with the purpose of giving an easy way to create that sub-request and one operation for each resource with the purpose of giving an easy way to parse the response of its correlated sub-request, named "Post <name_of_resource>".
You also have an operation responsible to send a list of sub-request to Salesforce and return a list of responses.

Another operation that this connector has available is "createSobjectTree" which creates one or more sObject trees with root records of the specified type (https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/resources_composite_sobject_tree.htm[Salesforce SObject Tree documentation]).

==== Adding the Salesforce Composite Connector to a Flow

. Create a new Mule project in Anypoint Studio.
. Drag the Salesforce Composite connector onto the canvas, then select it to open the properties editor.
. Configure the connector's parameters:

+

image::operation-config.png[Salesforce Composite operation config]

+

[%header,frame=topbot]
|===
|Field |Description
|Display Name | Enter a unique label for the connector in your application.
|Connector Configuration | Select a global element from the drop-drown that you have created under <<Configuring the Salesforce Composite Global Element>> section.
|Operation | Select an operation for the connector to perform.
|===
+
. Click the blank space on the canvas and save your configurations.

== Example Use Cases

=== Example Use Case 1

In this use case it is described how to use the connector for preparing four sub-requests, execute them in one batch and parse the responses. The sub-requests that we are going to execute are update an account, update a contact, retrieve the updated account and contact, respectively.
The input data that we need in order to create sub-requests will be read from a file and the results of execution are going to be also logged into a file.
So lets get to work.

Create a new Mule Project by clicking on *File > New > Mule Project*. In the new project dialog box, the only thing you are required to enter is the name of the project. Click on *Finish*.

image::new-project-dialog.png[New project dialog]

Now lets create the flow. Navigate through the project's structure and double-click on *src/main/app/project-name.xml* and follow the steps below:

. Go to palette and search for "File".
. Drag and drop the "File" element on canvas. This element is going to read the file where we put input data needed for creating sub-requests.
+
image::file-element.png[File element]
+
. Double click on file element and set its properties as below:
.. "Path" to "src/main/resources/input"
.. "Move to Directory" to "src/main/resources/processed"
+
image::input-file-config.png[Input File Config]
+
. Go to palette, search for "Splitter" and drag and drop it on canvas after "File". This element is used for splitting input data into items each being used as input for operations responsible of preparing sub-requests. We will provide input data in XML format so will use xref:3.7@mule-runtime::xpath.adoc[xpath3] as a split expression.
+
image::input-splitter.png[Input splitter]
+
. Double click on "Splitter" and set its properties as below:
.. "Enable Correlation" select "ALWAYS".
.. "Expression" to "#[xpath3('/items/item', payload, 'NODESET')]"
+
image::input-splitter-config.png[Input splitter config]
+
. Go to palette, search for "DOM to XML" and drag and drop it on flow after "Splitter". We need this element because the result of splitter is a DOM object and the next component operates on strings in XML format.
. Go to palette, search for "Choice" and drag and drop it on flow after "DOM to XML". This element will route the input data item to its correlating "Composite" element based on its operation.
+
image::input-choice.png[Input Choice]
+
. Go to palette, search for "Logger" and drag it inside "Default" section of "Choice".
. Double click on logger and set its properties as below:
.. "Message" to "Unable to route item based on operation."
+
image::input-choice-default-logger.png[Choice default branch logger]
+
. Go to palette, search for "Transform Message" and drag inside the choice four of them one below the other.
. Go to palette, search for "Salesforce Composite" and drag one after each "Transform Message" from previous step.

=== Example Use Case 3

In this use case it is described how to use the connector for creating SObject Trees.

. First we need to add an HTTP endpoint and configure it.
. Then we need to add the Salesforce Composite connector to the flow after the HTTP endpoint.
. The next step would be to create a configuration for the connector as in the previous use cases (see steps 22 and 23 from Example Use Case 1).
. After creating the configuration, we need to validate the credentials through the "Test Connection..." button.
. Now that we know the credentials are ok and we can connect to Salesforce, we will choose the Operation that we want to execute, in this case: "Create sobject tree".
. Two parameters should appear under the General section: "SObject Root Type" and "SObject Tree".
. The "SObject Root Type" parameter represents the Sobject type of the root of the trees that will be created. When a value is chosen (for example "Account"), DataSense  will bring the input and output metadata  based on the chosen root type. The metadata tree has a depth of 5 levels, since that is the current limitation from https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/resources_composite_sobject_tree.htm[Salesforce].
. The "SObject Tree" parameter will take as input a reference to a Map containing the Sobject Trees to be created. For more details you can check this https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/requests_composite_sobject_tree.htm#sobject-tree-input[SObject Tree Input example from Salesforce].
. To create the Map containig the tree, a Transform Message component can be used, to map the information from any format to the format expected by the operation.
. The output of the operation will contain the Salesforce Id, and the referece Id of the objects create successfully along with a flag called "hasErrors" that gives the status of the whole request ("false" if the entire tree was created successfully and "true" if the creation of any of the objects has failed).
. An example flow follows:

= Salesforce Composite Connector 2.8 - Mule 4

Support Category: https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#anypoint-connectors[Select]

Anypoint Connector for Salesforce Composite enables you to work with the Salesforce Batch and SObject Tree APIs. The connector exposes convenient methods for preparing subordinate requests, executing them in one batch, and parsing the results.

Salesforce Composite Connector also enables you to create SObject trees by using the *Create sobject tree* operation, which is separate from the batch operations.

This connector provides DataSense for execution and to:

* Prepare subordinate requests and then parse the responses
* Create SObject trees

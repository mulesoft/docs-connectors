= AMQP Connector Reference
:keywords: anypoint, components, elements, connectors, amqp
:page-aliases: 3.6@mule-runtime::amqp-connector-reference.adoc

This document lists and describes all of the configuration parameters supported by the AMQP connector, as well as all AMQP endpoint configuration elements.

== Connector Attributes

The AMQP connector defines what broker to connect to, which credentials to use when connecting, and all the common properties used by the inbound and outbound endpoints that use this connector.

You can create several connectors connected to the same broker for the purpose of having different sets of common properties that endpoints can use.

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|Name |Description
|`host` |The main AMQP broker host to connect to.

*Type*: string +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: `localhost`
|`port` |The port to use to connect to the main AMQP broker.

*Type*: port number +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: `5672`
|`fallbackAddresses` |A comma-separated list of hosts, listed as `<host>` or `<host:port>`. If the connection to the main broker fails, the hosts listed here are the fallback brokers to attempt to connect to.  For more information, see xref:amqp-connector-examples.adoc#connection-fallback[Connection Fallback].

*Type*: string +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`virtualHost` |The virtual host to connect to on the AMQP broker.

*Type*: string +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: `/`
|`username` |The user name to use to connect to on the AMQP broker.

*Type*: string +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: `guest`
|`password` |The password to use to connect to the AMQP broker.

*Type*: string +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: `guest`
|`deliveryMode` |The delivery mode to use when publishing to the AMQP broker.

Possible values are:

* `PERSISTENT`
* `NON_PERSISTENT`

*Type*: string +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: `PERSISTENT`
|`priority` |The priority to use when publishing to the AMQP broker. The priority has possible values from `0` to `9` - default is `0`.

*Type*: byte +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: `0`
|`mandatory` |Tells the server how to react if the message cannot be routed to a queue. If set to `true`, the server throws an exception for any unroutable message. If set to `false`, the server silently drops the message.

*Type*: boolean +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: `false`
|`immediate` |Tells the server how to react if the message cannot be routed to a queue consumer immediately. If set to `true`, the server throws an exception for any undeliverable message. If set to `false`, the server queues the message, but with no guarantee that it will ever be consumed.

*Type*: boolean +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: `false`
|`default-return-endpoint-ref` |Reference to an endpoint to which an AMQP returned message should be dispatched to.

*Type*: string +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`ackMode` |The acknowledgment mode to use when consuming from the AMQP broker.

Possible values are:

* `AMQP_AUTO` - The AMQP broker  considers messages acknowledged once delivered.
* `MULE_AUTO` - Mule  automatically acknowledges messages when the flow has been processed, if no exception has been encountered. Using asynchronous sub-flows or dispatch may lead to early acknowledgment.
* `MANUAL` - The AMQP broker expects explicit message acknowledgments.

*Type*: string +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: `AMQP_AUTO`
|`prefetchSize` |The maximum amount of content (measured in octets) that the server delivers. 0 means unlimited.

*Type*: integer +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: `0`
|`prefetchCount` |The maximum number of messages that the server  delivers. 0 means unlimited.

*Type*: integer +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: `0`
|`noLocal` |If set to true, the server does not send messages to the connection that published them.

*Type*: boolean +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: `false`
|`exclusiveConsumers` |Set to true if the connector should only create exclusive consumers.

*Type*: boolean +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: `false`
|`activeDeclarationsOnly` |Defines if the connector should only do active exchange and queue declarations, or if it should perform passive declarations to enforce the existence of the queue or exchange. If set to `false` and if the queue or exchange does not exist, the AMQP connector throws a ShutdownSignalException, a 404 error, and returns reply text starting with `NOT_FOUND`.

For a discussion on active versus passive declarations, see http://bitingcode.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/passive-or-active-queues.html[Passive or active queues?]

*Note:* The AMQP connector does not create queues or exchanges if they do not exist.

*Type*: boolean +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: `false`

== Endpoint Attributes

Endpoint attributes are interpreted differently if they are used on inbound or outbound endpoints. For example, on an inbound endpoint the attribute `routingKey` is used for queue binding, and on an outbound endpoint it is used as a basic publish parameter.

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|Name |Description
|`exchangeName` |The exchange to publish to or bind queues to. Use `AMQP.DEFAULT.EXCHANGE` for the default exchange. (The previous approach, which consists in leaving blank or omitting `exchangeName` for the default exchange, still works but is not recommended.)

*Type*: string +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`queueName` |Name of the queue to consume from. Leave blank or omit for using a new private exclusive server-named queue.

*Type*: string +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`routingKey` |Comma-separated routing keys to use when binding a queue or publishing a message.

*Type*: string +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`consumerTag` |A client-generated consumer tag to establish context.

*Type*: string +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`exchangeType` |The type of exchange to be declared.

Possible values are:

* `fanout` - Broadcasts all messages the exchange receives to all bound queues.
* `direct` - A message goes to a specific queue.
* `topic` - A pattern that determines which queues receive a message. The pattern is a list of words delimited by dots up to 255 characters in length. The pattern can use an asterisk (&#x2217;) to substitute for a single word. A hash tag (&#x0023;) can substitute for zero or more words. For more information, see https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-five-python.html[RabbitMQ Topics].
* `headers` - A message is sent to a queue depending on its header attributes.

*Type*: string +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`exchangeDurable` |The durability of the declared exchange. A durable exchange survives a broker restart.

*Type*: boolean +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`exchangeAutoDelete` |Specifies if the declared exchange should be autodeleted.

*Type*: boolean +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`queueDurable` |Specifies if the declared queue is durable. A durable queue persists to disk and survives a broker restart. *Note:* Messages routed to the queue are not durable.

*Type*: boolean +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`queueAutoDelete` |Specifies if the declared queue should be autodeleted.

*Type*: boolean +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`queueExclusive` |Specifies if the declared queue is exclusive.

*Type*: boolean +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none

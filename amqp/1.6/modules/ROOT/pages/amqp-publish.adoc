= Publish Messages - Mule 4


The `publish` operation enables you to create a new AMQP message and send it to the specified exchange. You can then configure not only the content of the message, but also all the headers, the properties, and the envelope in the AMQP message.

== Send a Message to an Exchange

When used in its default form, the connector will publish whatever is in the message payload:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<amqp:publish config-ref="AMQP_Config" exchangeName="targetExchange"/>
----

But what happens if the payload is not in the correct format, and you actually need to make a transformation? You could place a DataWeave transformation before the `publish` operation, but that would cause the message payload to change and impact the operation placed after the `publish` operation.

To avoid this undesired impact, you can now place the transformation inside the `publish` operation:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<amqp:publish config-ref="Amqp_Config" exchangeName="targetExchange">
	<amqp:message>
		<amqp:body>
		<![CDATA[#[%dw 2.0
			output application/json
			---
			payload.payments
		]]]></amqp:body>
	</amqp:message>
</amqp:publish>
----

Now, the transformation can be used for generating the content that will be published, without producing a side effect on the message in transit.

== Override or Set the Routing Keys of the Message

You may need to set or override the routing key of the property. The routing key is represented by a property of an AMQP message:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<amqp:publish config-ref="Amqp_Config" exchangeName="targetExchange">
	<amqp:message>
		<amqp:body>
		<![CDATA[#[%dw 2.0
			output application/json
			---
			payload.payments
		]]]></amqp:body>
	</amqp:message>
	<amqp:routing-keys >
		<amqp:routing-key value="routingKey1" />
		<amqp:routing-key value="routingKey*" />
	</amqp:routing-keys>
</amqp:publish>
----


== Declare a Reply Destination

For the cases where you need an asynchronous reply to the message being sent, the AMQP `publish` operation allows us to declare any `reply-to` destination. This destination will be communicated as an AMQP message Property to the consumer of the Message. It represents the destination where we should expect a reply to be sent.

To declare the `reply-to` destination, we add it to the message properties:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<amqp:publish config-ref="AMQP_config" exchangeName="#[vars.targetExchange]">
	<amqp:message>
		<amqp:properties replyTo="replyToQueue" />
	</amqp:message>
</amqp:publish>
----

== Request Confirms from the Broker

If you need that the broker confirms a publish operation, you can set the `requestBrokerConfirms` parameter. Setting this parameter, the channel in the publish operation is set in confirm mode and the connector will expect a `basic.ack` from the broker. The parameter can be set in the global publisher configuration or at the operation level.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<amqp:publish
	config-ref="AMQP_config"
	exchangeName="#[vars.targetExchange]"
	requestBrokerConfirms="true">
	<amqp:message>
		<amqp:properties replyTo="replyToQueue" />
	</amqp:message>
</amqp:publish>
----

In case no confirmation arrives, an `AMQP:PUBLISHING` error will be raised indicating that the broker failed to agree on confirming messages.

== Returned Messages Handling

The connector supports the mandatory and immediate publication flags.

If a message sent with this connector cannot be delivered, the AMQP broker returns it asynchronously.

The AMQP connector offers the possibility of dispatching these returned messages to an exchange for custom processing.

You can define the endpoint in charge of handling returned messages at the connector level. Here is an example:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<amqp:publish config-ref="AMQP_config" exchangeName="#[vars.targetExchange]" returnedMessageExchange="exchange" mandatory="true" immediate="true" />
----

== Declare an Exchange in the Publish Operation

By default, the `publish` operation will fail in case the defined exchange does not exist with an `AMQP:EXCHANGE_NOT_FOUND` error.

For cases where the exchange has to be declared, a definition for the entity should be referenced or inline defined so that the exchange is declared.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<amqp:publish
	config-ref="Amqp_Config"
	exchangeName="targetExchange">
	<amqp:fallback-exchange-definition
		removalStrategy="SHUTDOWN"
		type="DIRECT"/>
</amqp:publish>
----

The exchange can also be defined as a high level element:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<amqp:exchange-defintiion
	name="targetExchangeDefinition"
	removalStrategy="SHUTDOWN"
	type="DIRECT" />

<amqp:publish
	config-ref="Amqp_Config"
	exchangeName="targetExchange"
	fallbackExchangeDefinition="targetExchangeDefinition" />
----

== Avoid Changing the AMQP Topography

You can set the `createFallbackExchange` global config to prevent changes to the AMQP topography resulting from the definition of fallback exchanges, see xref:amqp-topography.adoc[Avoid Changing the AMQP Topography].

== Propagate the Correlation ID

The `publish` operation allows you to configure the `correlationId` for the outgoing Message.

First you need to configure whether or not you want to send the `correlationId` when publishing the Message using the `sendCorrelationId` parameter. This parameter can be set to `ALWAYS` (always send the header), `NEVER` (never send the header) or `AUTO` (the default, use the application configuration).
Then, you can either use the `correlationId` of the Event that is sending the Message, or you can configure your own custom `correlationId` in the message builder:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<amqp:publish
	config-ref="AMQP_config"
	sendCorrelationId="ALWAYS"
	exchangeName="#[vars.targetExchange]">
	<amqp:properties
		correlationId="#[attributes.properties.correlationId]" />
</amqp:publish>
----

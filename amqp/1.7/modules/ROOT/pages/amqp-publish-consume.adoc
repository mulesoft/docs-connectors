= Listen For A Reply - Mule 4
:page-aliases: connectors::amqp/amqp-publish-consume.adoc


Request and Reply is a very common pattern between applications. AMQP Connector provides an operation specially designed for this, called `publish-consume`. The `publish-consume` operation enables you to publish a message to any exchange, and then wait for a reply on a different destination.

When using this operation, the `replyTo` property of the outgoing message will contain the ID of the queue at which your app will be waiting for a response. This destination may be a well-known destination, or it may be a temporary queue created on the fly with the only purpose of receiving a single response message.

Finally, the result of the operation will be the message received as a response, with exactly the same structure as if a `consume` operation was invoked.

== Wait For A Reply On A Temporary Queue

Using a temporary Queue to wait for a response is very simple, just configure the message being sent and the operation will automatically wait for a response in a temporary queue:
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<amqp:publish-consume
	config-ref="config"
	exchangeName="targetExchange"
	maximumWait="20"
	maximumWaitUnit="SECONDS"/>
----

In this example, the operation will `publish` a message with the current `payload` as its *body* and the *replyTo property* of the message configured to a temporary destination, to the `targetExchange`.
Then, it will automatically try to consume the response from that temporary queue until a message is consumed or the `maximumWait` is reached (in which case it will fail with a `AMQP:TIMEOUT` error).

== Receive The Reply On A Known Queue

In many cases you don't want reply queues to be created per-request basis, but instead a well-known queue is used for replies. For this cases, all you have to do is configure the `reply-to` parameter on the outgoing Message:
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<amqp:publish-consume config-ref="config" exchangeName="targetExchange">
    <amqp:message>
    		<amqp:properties reply-to="replyToQueue" />
    </amqp:message>
</amqp:publish-consume>
----

Now the operation will `publish` a message to the `targetExchange` with the current `payload` as its *body* and the `replyTo` *property* configured with the `replyToQueue`.
Then, it will automatically try to consume the response from the `replyToQueue` queue until a message is consumed or the `maximumWait` is reached (in which case it will fail with a `AMQP:TIMEOUT` error).

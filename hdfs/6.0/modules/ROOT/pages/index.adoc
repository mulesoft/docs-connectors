Hadoop (HDFS) Connector Version 6.0

Anypoint Connector for Hadoop (HDFS) works as a bidirectional gateway between Mule applications and Apache Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). You can use the Hadoop (HDFS) Connector to poll the content of a file at a configurable rate or interval, or to manipulate data in an HDFS server.

For information about compatibility and fixed issues, see xref:release-notes::connector/hdfs-connector-release-notes-mule-4.adoc[Hadoop (HDFS) Connector Release Notes]

== Before You Begin

To use this connector, you must be familiar with:

* Anypoint Connectors
* Mule runtime engine (Mule)
* Elements in a Mule flow
* Global elements
* How to create a Mule app using Anypoint Studio

Before creating an app, you must have:

* Access to the Hadoop (HDFS) target resource and Anypoint Platform
* Anypoint Studio version 7.0 or later
* A running instance of Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)

== Connection Authentication Types

Hadoop (HDFS) Connector supports the following connection authentication types:

* Kerberos +
This connection type uses the Kerberos principal as the username. The keytab path you specify obtains a ticket-granting ticket (TGT) from the authorization server.
* Simple +
This connection type passes the name of the node that contains the file system you want to connect to as the default name key.

== Next Step

After you complete the prerequisites and experiment with templates and examples, you are ready to create an app with xref:hdfs-connector-studio.adoc[Anypoint Studio].

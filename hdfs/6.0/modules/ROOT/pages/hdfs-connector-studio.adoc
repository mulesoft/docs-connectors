= Using Anypoint Studio to Configure Hadoop (HDFS) Connector - Mule 4
:page-aliases: connectors::hdfs/hdfs-connector-studio.adoc

Anypoint Studio (Studio) editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.

To add and configure a connector in Studio:

. Create a Mule project.
. Add the connector to your Mule project
. Configure an input source for the connector's flow.
. Configure global elements for the connector.

If you are new to configuring Anypoint Connectors in Studio, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-config-use-studio.adoc[Using Anypoint Studio to Configure a Connector].

== Create a Mule Project

In Anypoint Studio, create a new Mule project in which to add and configure the connector.

. In Anypoint Studio, from the main menu, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
. Enter a name for your Mule project, and click *Finish*.

== Add the Connector to Your Mule Project

Add Hadoop (HDFS) Connector to a Mule project to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location, as well as add the required dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file.

. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Modules to Project*, type `hdfs` in the search field.
. Click the name of the connector in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that same connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.

== Configure an Input Source

An input source initiates a flow when a specified condition is met. The act of dragging the connector's operation from the palette onto the Anypoint Studio canvas automatically populates the XML code with the connector namespace and schema location.

Possible input source operations for this connector are:

* Read +
Starts your app when the content of a file is read and streamed to the rest of the flow.
* HTTP Listener +
Starts your app using a browser or a command such as `curl`.
* Scheduler +
Starts your app at timed intervals.

In Studio, drag the input operation you choose from the *Mule Palette* to the *Source* panel in the canvas, and supply the required parameters.

For example, the required fields for the `Read` input source are:

* Configuration +
The name of the connector configuration to use
* Path +
The path for the file to read

[[configure_global_element]]
== Configure a Global Element for the Connector

To configure a connector in your Mule app, configure a global element that can be used by all instances of that connector in the flow:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, search for the connector and select an operation.
. Drag the operation onto the canvas to the right of the input source.
. In the configuration screen for the operation, click the plus sign (+) next to the *Connector configuration* field to add a global element for the connector.
. In the *General* tab, enter a name for the configuration, and select the connection type from *Connection*. +
Supported connection types for this connector are:
* xref:hdfs-connector-reference.adoc#hdfs_kerberos[*Kerberos*]
* xref:hdfs-connector-reference.adoc#hdfs_simple[*Simple*]
+
For information about how to configure the connections, see xref:hdfs-connector-reference.adoc#connection_types[Connection Types].
+
You can provide your credentials in the global configuration properties, or you can reference a configuration file that contains those values.
+
To simplify maintenance and improve project reusability, of your project, use a configuration file. Keeping these values in a separate file is useful if you need to deploy to different environments, such as production, development, and QA, where your access credentials differ.

See xref:connectors::introduction/intro-connector-configuration-overview.adoc[Anypoint Connector Configuration] for more information.
. Click the *Advanced* tab to specify a reconnection strategy, if supported.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

:page-aliases: 3.7@mule-runtime::oracle-ebs-connector-user-guide.adoc

Anypoint Connector for Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) provides real-time connectivity to query and update Oracle EBS using web services and message queues. The connector has been developed for the Oracle EBS v12.1.x. For more information about Oracle EBS, visit the http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/ebusiness/overview/index.html[Oracle site]. Review the connector operations and functionality using the https://mulesoft.github.io/mule3-oracle-ebs-connector/[ApiDoc Technical Reference and demo applications].

Track feature additions, compatibility, limitations and API version updates with each release of the connector using the xref:release-notes::connector/oracle-e-business-suite-ebs-connector-release-notes.adoc[Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) Connector Release Notes]. MuleSoft maintains this connector under the xref:3.7@mule-runtime::anypoint-connectors.adoc#connector-categories[_Premium_] support policy.

Oracle EBS connector provides integration to the following:

* *Financial Management and Order Management Modules*: Full API coverage for Financials and Order Management services.
* *PL/SQL Integration*: Both standard PL/SQL or user-defined PL/SQL can be invoked.
* *XML Gateway*: Inbound and Outbound, to send and receive message to and from EBS.
* *Business Events*: The ability to receive messages when an event is fired in EBS, via the `WF_JMS_JMS_OUT` topic.

The complete list of supported web service endpoints can be found <<Supported Web Service Endpoints,here>>.

== Prerequisites

Because of how closely the connector is coupled with Oracle EBS, this document assumes you have:

* A working knowledge of Oracle EBS.
* Read the relevant documentation on Web Services and Integration Scenarios for your Oracle EBS version.

[TIP]
A definition and detailed explanation of the Oracle EBS terms and concepts used here are freely available in the Oracle documentation set of your Oracle installation.

This document assumes you are familiar with Mule, xref:3.7@mule-runtime::anypoint-connectors.adoc[Anypoint Connectors], and xref:5@studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio Essentials]. To increase your familiarity with Studio, consider completing one or more xref:5@studio::basic-studio-tutorial.adoc[Anypoint Studio Tutorials]. Further, this page assumes that you have a basic understanding of xref:3.7@mule-runtime::elements-in-a-mule-flow.adoc[Mule flows] and xref:3.7@mule-runtime::global-elements.adoc[Mule Global Elements].

To use the Oracle EBS connector, you must have the following:

* *Java 7*: Oracle EBS connector does not work unless you are using Java 1.7.0_x as your JRE
* *Web service configuration in Oracle EBS*: Configuring the Oracle EBS connector requires configuring web services in Oracle EBS and exposing them via the Integration Repository
* *FND_WEB_SEC PL/SQL Service*: The connector requires Oracle EBS to have the FND_WEB_SEC PL/SQL service deployed
* *Anypoint Studio*

== Namespace and Schema

When designing your application in Studio, the act of dragging the connector from the palette onto the Anypoint Studio canvas should automatically populate the XML code with the connector *namespace* and *schema location*.

[TIP]
If you are manually coding the Mule application in Studio's XML editor or other text editor, paste these into the header of your *Configuration XML* inside the tags specified below.

=== Namespace

----
xmlns:oracle-ebs="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/oracle-ebs
----

=== Schema Location

[source,text,linenums]
----
xsi:schemaLocation="
http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/oracle-ebs http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/oracle-ebs/current/mule-oracle-ebs.xsd
..."

----

== Compatibility

Oracle EBS Connector 3.0.0 is compatible with:

[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Application/Service|Version
|*Mule Runtime* |3.7 or higher
|*Anypoint Studio* |5.2.1 or higher
|*Oracle EBS* |12.1.x
|*Java* |7
|===

[IMPORTANT]
Please note that this connector only supports EBS version 12.1.x with SOA Gateway. Due to licensing changes by Oracle, version 12.2.x does not ship with SOA Gateway and will not work with this connector.

== Connector Architecture

Oracle EBS offers different technologies or products to address various types of integrations. Listed below are the most widely used for integration with enterprise applications:

. Data-centric integration.
. Event-driven integration using Oracle Business Event System and XML Gateway queues.
. Integration through Web Services using Integrated SOA gateway.

The following illustration shows the integration architecture of the MuleSoft Oracle EBS connector:

=== Subscribing to a Queue or a Topic

* To *subscribe to a queue or topic* (such as the XML Gateway Outbound queue or the Business Events topic), you need to drag the connector to the "Source" section of your flow. After doing so, and selecting a connector configuration, you have to choose the queue/topic you wish to subscribe to, from the *Operation* dropdown.

. Create a new Mule project in Anypoint Studio.
. Drag a new Flow scope element onto the canvas.
. Add an Oracle EBS connector as an Inbound endpoint at the beginning of the flow.
. Drag a Logger to the Process section of the flow.
. Configure the connector's parameters according to the table below.
+
[%autowidth.spread]
|===
|*Field* |*Description*
|*Display Name* |Enter a unique label for the connector in your application.
|*Connector Configuration* |Select a Oracle EBS connector element that you have created.
|*Operation* |Select the queue or topic you wish to subscribe to from the dropdown. In this example, we select *Business Events*, but you could alternatively pick *XML Gateway Outbound*.
|===
. Save your configurations.

== Custom Attributes for Business Events
[NOTE]
====
To set *custom attributes* for a business event besides the default attributes, you need to add the attributes manually, and create a subscription to the event.
====

. First, *add attributes* to an Oracle EBS business event. You can even run a script in your PL/SQL client for the purpose of creating the custom key-value pairs representing the custom messages or event attributes you require.
+
////
//link to KB article once ready
[source,text,linenums]
----
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE xx_modify_event_parameters
(
p_subscription_guid IN RAW,
              	p_event             IN OUT NOCOPY wf_event_t
)  return varchar2 is
l_plist   wf_parameter_list_t := p_event.getparameterlist ();
	Begin

    -- Add code for adding new attributes to the event list

wf_event.addparametertolist (
p_name => 'QUOTE_HEADER_ID',
p_value => p_qte_header_rec.quote_header_id,
p_parameterlist => l_plist
);

		RETURN 'SUCCESS';

     EXCEPTION
          WHEN OTHERS
          THEN
             wf_core.context (
                'xxu_bes',
                'inv_po_matching',
                p_event.geteventname (),
                p_subscription_guid
             );
             wf_event.seterrorinfo (p_event, 'ERROR');
             RETURN 'ERROR';
	End;
----
////
+
. Now add a subscription to the event you assigned new attributes to.
.. Navigate to the *Workflow Administrator Web Applications* responsibility. Choose the *Business Events* you would like to modify.
.. Click the plus sign to add a subscription to an event.
+
image::add-subscription.png[add subscrip plus sign]
+
.. Click on *Create Subscription*.
+
image::create-subscription.png[]
+
. Provide appropriate values for each field. Find a description of the fields and values below, along with some screenshots of the workspace in which you configure these fields.
.. *Subscriber*
... *System* - Designate the system you need subscribed to the event
.. *Triggering Event*
... *Event Filter* - Enter the name of the business event that this subscription should be triggered by.
.. *Execution Condition*
... *Phase* - a value greater than or equal to 100 means the subscription fires in an asynchronous way. Enter "100" for this field.
... *Status* - “Enabled”
... *Rule Data* - “Message”
.. *Action Type*
... *Action Type* - "Custom"
+
image::event-subscription-fields.png[]
+
image::custom-event-subscription-fields.png[]

At this point you should be set up to retrieve those custom attributes from the enqueued business events using the Oracle EBS connector.


=== Invoking a Web Service Operation

* To *invoke a web service operation*, you must drag the connector to the "Process" section of your flow and fill in its input parameters. If the operation you need to invoke is a PL/SQL function exposed as a web service, select the *Invoke PL/SQL* Operation, and then make a selection from the *PL/SQL* and *Function* dropdown menus that appear in the General tab.

. Create a new Mule project in Anypoint Studio.
. Add a suitable Mule Inbound endpoint, such as the HTTP listener or File endpoint, to begin the flow.
. Drag the Oracle EBS connector onto the canvas, then select it to open the properties editor.
. Configure the connector's parameters according to the below.
+
image::oracle-ebs-config.png[oracle_ebs_config]
+
[%autowidth.spread]
|===
|*Field* |*Description*
|*Display Name* |Enter a unique label for the connector in your application.
|*Connector Configuration* |Connect to a global element linked to this connector. Global elements encapsulate reusable data about the connection to the target resource or service. Select the global Oracle EBS connector element that you just created.
|*Operation* |Select the operation from the dropdown. You can select any of the operations displayed or the *Invoke PL/SQL* operation, which allows you to execute a web service published from PL/SQL.
|*Params* |Complete the parameters needed for the operation selected. If the *Invoke PL/SQL* operation is selected, you need to select the *PL/SQL* and *Function* parameters with an operation to be executed.
|===
. Save your configurations.
. If you select the *Invoke PL/SQL* operation, you need to add a *Transform Message* transformer to map the values from the flow to the input parameters for the PL/SQL operation.

. Drag a new *Flow* scope element onto the canvas.
. Add an Oracle EBS connector as an inbound endpoint at the beginning of the flow.
+
image::oracle-ebs-config-source-2.png[oracle_ebs_config_source_2]
+
.. Add a new Oracle EBS Global Element by clicking the green plus sign (*+*).
.. Configure the global element according to the table below:
+
[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Field|Description
|*Name* |Enter a name you prefer
|*Username* |Username to log into Oracle EBS web services.
|*Password* |Password for the username.
|*Host* |Enter the host of the Oracle EBS instance.
|*Port* |Enter the port of the Oracle EBS web services.
|*DB Username* |Username for the Oracle EBS database.
|*DB Password* |Enter the password for the username.
|*DB Host* |Enter the host of the Oracle EBS database is located.
|*DB Port* |Enter the port of the Oracle EBS database.
|*Database SID* |Enter the SID of the database.
|*Responsibility Name* |Enter the responsibility name that is needed to execute the operation.
|*Responsibility Appl. Name* |Enter the application short name that is needed to execute the operation.
|*Security Group Name* |Enter the security group key of the Oracle EBS instance (optional).
|*NLS language* |Enter the NLS language of the Oracle EBS instance (optional).
|*Org. ID* |Enter the organization ID of the Oracle EBS instance (optional).
|*Custom PL/SQL web services* |Select *None*.
|*Required dependencies* |Select the location in your local file system for the Oracle AQ API and Oracle JDBC Driver JAR files. Both are used in the Test Connection process and subscription to queues and topics.
|===
+
.. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the Oracle EBS instance. If the connection is successful, click *OK* to save the configurations. If unsuccessful, revise or correct any incorrect parameters, then test again.
. Back in the properties editor of the Oracle EBS connector, configure the remaining parameters according to the table below:
+
[%autowidth.spread]
|===
|*Field* |*Value*
|*Display Name* |Business Events (or any other name you prefer)
|*Connector Configuration* |OracleEBS__Configuration (Enter name of the global element you have created)
|*Operation* |Business events
|===
+
. Add a *Logger* scope right after the EBS Connector, to print the messages received from the Business Events topic in the Mule Console. Configure the Logger according to the table below:
+
[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|*Field* |*Value*
|*Display Name* |Logger (or any other name you prefer)
|*Message* |`#[payload]`
|*Level* |INFO (Default)
|===
+
. Save and run the project as a Mule Application by right-clicking the project name in the Package Explorer, selecting *Run As* > *Mule Application*.
.. For every Business Event that is fired, you will see the corresponding message taken from the queue in the console log.

Anypoint Connector for Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) provides real-time connectivity to query and update Oracle EBS using web services and message queues. The connector has been developed for the *Oracle EBS v12.1.x*. For Oracle EBS 12.2, see the xref:3.9@mule-runtime::oracle-ebs-122-connector.adoc[Oracle EBS 12.2 Connector].

Read through this user guide to understand how to set up and configure a basic flow using the connector. Track feature additions, compatibility, limitations and API version updates with each release of the connector using the *Release Notes:* xref:release-notes::connector/oracle-e-business-suite-ebs-connector-release-notes.adoc[Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) Connector Release Notes].

Review the connector operations and functionality using the http://mulesoft.github.io/mule3-oracle-ebs-connector/4.0.0/apidocs/mule/oracle-ebs-config.html[Technical Reference] alongside the http://mulesoft.github.io/mule3-oracle-ebs-connector/[demo applications].

MuleSoft maintains this connector under the xref:3.9@mule-runtime::anypoint-connectors.adoc#connector-categories[_Premium_] support policy.

Oracle EBS connector provides integration to the following:

* *Financial Management and Order Management Modules*: Full API coverage for Financials and Order Management services.
* *PL/SQL Integration*: Both standard PL/SQL or user-defined PL/SQL can be invoked.
* *XML Gateway*: Inbound and Outbound, to send and receive message to and from EBS.
* *Business Events*: The ability to receive messages when an event is fired in EBS, via the `WF_JMS_JMS_OUT` topic.

The complete list of supported web service endpoints can be found <<Supported Web Service Endpoints,here>>.

== Before You Begin

Because of how closely the connector is coupled with Oracle EBS, this document assumes you have:

* A working knowledge of Oracle EBS.
* Read the relevant documentation on Web Services and Integration Scenarios for your Oracle EBS version.

[TIP]
A definition and detailed explanation of the Oracle EBS terms and concepts used here are freely available in the Oracle documentation set of your Oracle installation.


This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule,
xref:3.9@mule-runtime::anypoint-connectors.adoc[Anypoint Connectors], and
xref:6.x@studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio Essentials]. To increase your familiarity with Studio, consider completing a xref:6.x@studio::basic-studio-tutorial.adoc[Anypoint Studio Tutorial]. This page requires some basic knowledge of xref:3.9@mule-runtime::mule-concepts.adoc[Mule Concepts], xref:3.9@mule-runtime::elements-in-a-mule-flow.adoc[Elements in a Mule Flow], and xref:3.9@mule-runtime::global-elements.adoc[Global Elements].

=== Hardware and Software Requirements

For hardware and software requirements, please visit the xref:3.9@mule-runtime::hardware-and-software-requirements.adoc[Hardware and Software Requirements] page.


To use the Oracle EBS connector, you must have the following:

* *Java 7*: Oracle EBS connector does not work unless you are using Java 1.7.0_x as your JRE
* *Web service configuration in Oracle EBS*: Configuring the Oracle EBS connector requires configuring web services in Oracle EBS and exposing them via the Integration Repository
* *FND_WEB_SEC PL/SQL Service*: The connector requires Oracle EBS to have the FND_WEB_SEC PL/SQL service deployed
* *Anypoint Studio*

. If you plan to use Git, select *Create a .gitignore file* for the project with default ignore settings for Studio Projects, and then click *Next.*
+
. Click *Next* to verify that Java 1.7 is set as your default
 JRE.
 +
image:java7check.png[javacheck]
+
. Click *Finish* to create the project.

== Configuring an Oracle EBS Global Element

To use the Oracle EBS connector in your Mule application, you must configure a global Oracle EBS element that can be used by all the Oracle EBS connectors in the application (read more about xref:3.7@mule-runtime::global-elements.adoc[global elements]).
Global elements can be of three types:

. _Configuration_: for web services and PL/SQL invocation.
. _JMS Configuration_: for Business Events and XML Gateway Outbound subscriptions using separate fields for database host, port and SID.
. _JMS URL Configuration_: for Business Events and XML Gateway Outbound subscriptions, using a database URL.

== Using the Connector

Use the Oracle EBS connector as a message source if you wish to *subscribe to queues*. If your goal is to *invoke web service operations*, use the connector as an outbound, operation-based connector.

== Namespace and Schema

When designing your application in Studio, the act of dragging the connector from the palette onto the Anypoint Studio canvas should automatically populate the XML code with the connector *namespace* and *schema location*.

*Namespace:* `http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/oracle-ebs`
*Schema Location:* `http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/oracle-ebs/current/mule-oracle-ebs.xsd`

[TIP]
If you are manually coding the Mule application in Studio's XML editor or other text editor, define the namespace and schema location in the header of your *Configuration XML*, inside the `<mule>` tag.

=== Subscribing to a Queue or a Topic

* To *subscribe to a queue or topic* (such as the XML Gateway Outbound queue or the Business Events topic), you need to drag the connector to the "Source" section of your flow. After doing so, and selecting a connector configuration, you have to choose the queue/topic you wish to subscribe to, from the *Operation* dropdown.

. Create a new Mule project in Anypoint Studio.
. Drag a new Flow scope element onto the canvas.
. Add an Oracle EBS connector as an Inbound endpoint at the beginning of the flow.
. Drag a Logger to the Process section of the flow.
. Configure the connector's parameters according to the table below.
+
[%autowidth.spread]
|===
|*Field* |*Description*
|*Display Name* |Enter a unique label for the connector in your application.
|*Connector Configuration* |Select an "OracleEBS: JMS Configuration" element that you have created.
|*Operation* |Select the queue or topic you wish to subscribe to from the dropdown. In this example, we select *Business Events*, but you could alternatively pick *XML Gateway Outbound*.
|*Durable Subscription* |(Only for Business Events) If checked, a durable subscription will be created. This means that if the client loses connectivity, all messages uploaded to the topic during this period will be retrieved as soon as it is restablished.
|*Subscription Name* |(Only for Business Events) If you wish to create a durable subscription, you can specify its name. If not, it will default to "muleBusinessEvents".
|===
. Save your configurations.

== Custom Attributes for Business Events
[NOTE]
====
To set *custom attributes* for a business event besides the default attributes, you need to add the attributes manually, and create a subscription to the event.
====

. First, *add attributes* to an Oracle EBS business event. You can even run a script in your PL/SQL client for the purpose of creating the custom key-value pairs representing the custom messages or event attributes you require.

             wf_event.seterrorinfo (p_event, 'ERROR');
             RETURN 'ERROR';
	End;
----
////
+
. Now add a subscription to the event you assigned new attributes to.
.. Navigate to the *Workflow Administrator Web Applications* responsibility. Choose the *Business Events* you would like to modify.
.. Click the plus sign to add a subscription to an event.
+
image::oracle-add-subscription.png[add subscrip plus sign]
+
.. Click on *Create Subscription*.
+
image::oracle-create-subscription.png[create subscription]
+
. Provide appropriate values for each field. Find a description of the fields and values below, along with some screenshots of the workspace in which you configure these fields.
.. *Subscriber*
... *System* - Designate the system you need subscribed to the event
.. *Triggering Event*
... *Event Filter* - Enter the name of the business event that this subscription should be triggered by.
.. *Execution Condition*
... *Phase* - a value greater than or equal to 100 means the subscription fires in an asynchronous way. Enter "100" for this field.
... *Status* - “Enabled”
... *Rule Data* - “Message”
.. *Action Type*
... *Action Type* - "Custom"
+
image::event-subscription-fields.png[]
+
image::custom-event-subscription-fields.png[]

At this point you should be set up to retrieve those custom attributes from the enqueued business events using the Oracle EBS connector.

=== Invoking a Web Service Operation

* To *invoke a web service operation*, you must drag the connector to the "Process" section of your flow and fill in its input parameters. If the operation you need to invoke is a PL/SQL function exposed as a web service, select the *Invoke PL/SQL* Operation, and then make a selection from the *PL/SQL* and *Function* dropdown menus that appear in the General tab.

. Create a new Mule project in Anypoint Studio.
. Add a suitable Mule Inbound endpoint, such as the HTTP listener or File endpoint, to begin the flow.
. Drag the Oracle EBS connector onto the canvas, then select it to open the properties editor.
. Configure the connector's parameters according to the below.
+
image::oracle-ebs-config.png[oracle_ebs_config]
+
[%autowidth.spread]
|===
|*Field* |*Description*
|*Display Name* |Enter a unique label for the connector in your application.
|*Connector Configuration* |Connect to a global element linked to this connector. Global elements encapsulate reusable data about the connection to the target resource or service. Select the global "OracleEBS: Configuration" element that you just created.
|*Operation* |Select the operation from the dropdown. You can select any of the operations displayed or the *Invoke PL/SQL* operation, which allows you to execute a web service published from PL/SQL.
|*Params* |Complete the parameters needed for the operation selected. If the *Invoke PL/SQL* operation is selected, you need to select the *PL/SQL* and *Function* parameters with an operation to be executed.
|===
. Save your configurations.
. If you select the *Invoke PL/SQL* operation, you need to add a *Transform Message* transformer to map the values from the flow to the input parameters for the PL/SQL operation.

		ns0#"P_PWD": inboundProperties."http.query.params".password
	}
}
----
+
. Add a *DOM to XML* transformer after the Oracle EBS Connector.
. Add a *Logger* scope right after the *DOM to XML* transformer to print the data that is being received from the Oracle EBS connector in the Mule Console. Configure the Logger according to the table below:
+
[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|*Field* |*Value*
|*Display Name* |Logger (or any other name you prefer)
|*Message* |Output from Transformer is `"\### EBS Test #[payload]"`
|*Level* |INFO (Default)
|===
+
. Add a *Catch Exception Strategy* and add a logger component inside it. Configure the logger message attribute with `#[payload]`, and set the level to ERROR.
+
[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|*Field* |*Value*
|*Display Name* |Logger (or any other name you prefer)
|*Message* |Error: #[payload]

|*Name* |Enter a name for the configuration with which it can be referenced later.
|*Username* |Username for the Oracle EBS database.
|*Password* |Enter the password for the username.
|*Host* |Enter the host of the Oracle EBS database.
|*Port* |Enter the port of the Oracle EBS database.
|*Database SID* |Enter the SID of the database.
|*Required dependencies* |Select the location in your local file system for the Oracle AQ API and Oracle JDBC Driver JAR files. Both are used in the Test Connection process and subscription to queues and topics.
|===
+
.. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the Oracle EBS instance. If the connection is successful, click *OK* to save the configurations. If unsuccessful, revise or correct any incorrect parameters, then test again.
. Back in the properties editor of the Oracle EBS connector, configure the remaining parameters according to the table below:
+
[%autowidth.spread]
|===
|*Field* |*Value*
|*Display Name* |Business Events (or any other name you prefer)
|*Connector Configuration* |OracleEBS__Configuration (Enter name of the global element you have created)
|*Operation* |Business events
|*Durable Subscription* |If checked, a durable subscription will be created. This means that if the client loses connectivity, all messages uploaded to the topic during this period will be retrieved as soon as it is restablished.
|*Subscription Name* |If you wish to create a durable subscription, you can specify its name. If not, it will default to "muleBusinessEvents".
|===
+
. Add a *Logger* scope right after the EBS Connector, to print the messages received from the Business Events topic in the Mule Console. Configure the Logger according to the table below:
+
[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|*Field* |*Value*
|*Display Name* |Logger (or any other name you prefer)
|*Message* |`#[payload]`
|*Level* |INFO (Default)
|===
+

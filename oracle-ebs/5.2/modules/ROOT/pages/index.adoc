Support Category: https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#anypoint-connectors[Premium]

Anypoint Connector for Oracle E-Business Suite (Oracle EBS Connector) provides real-time connectivity to query and update Oracle EBS using web services and message queues. The connector has been developed for the Oracle EBS v12.1.x.

Oracle EBS Connector provides integration to the following:

* Financial Management and Order Management Modules: Full API coverage for Financials and Order Management services
* PL/SQL Integration: Both standard PL/SQL or user-defined PL/SQL can be invoked
* XML Gateway: Inbound and Outbound, to send and receive message to and from EBS
* Business Events: The ability to receive messages when an event is fired in EBS, via the `WF_JMS_JMS_OUT` topic

== Before You Begin

To use this information, you should be familiar with Oracle EBS, Mule runtime engine (Mule), Anypoint Connectors, Anypoint Studio, Mule concepts, elements in a Mule flow, and Global Elements.

You need login credentials to test your connection to your target resource.

== Connector Architecture

Oracle EBS offers different technologies or products to address various types of integrations. The most widely used technologies for integration with enterprise applications includes:

. Data-centric integration
. Event-driven integration using Oracle Business Event System and XML Gateway queues
. Integration through Web Services using Oracle E-Business Suite Integrated SOA Gateway (ISG)

=== Add Libraries for This Connector

To subscribe to business events or to the XML Gateway queue, the JMS Configuration requires two external libraries:

. Go to the connector's JMS configuration.
. Click *Set Up* under the message to setup drivers.
. Upload and select your libraries.
.. Oracle AQ API: Can be retrieved from the EBS instance, at `$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/jlib/aqapi.jar`.
.. Oracle Database JDBC Driver: Can also be found in the instance, at `$ORACLE_HOME/jdbc/lib/ojdbc6.jar`.
+

== Add the Connector to a Studio Project

Anypoint Studio provides two ways to add the connector to your Studio project:

* From the Exchange button in the Studio taskbar
* From the Mule Palette view

=== Add the Connector Using Exchange

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. Click the Exchange icon *(X)* in the upper-left of the Studio task bar.
. In Exchange, click *Login* and supply your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. In Exchange, search for "ebs".
. Select the connector and click *Add to project*.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

=== Add the Connector in Studio

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. In the Mule Palette view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Modules to Project*, type "ebs" in the search field.
. Click this connector's name in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

=== Configure in Studio

. Drag a connector's operation to the Studio Canvas.
. Configure the example Get Party Site:
.. Id: TCA identifier for the Party Site business object.
.. Orig Sys: Party Site original system name.
.. Orig Sys Ref: Party Site original system reference.

[log-requests-responses]]
== Log PSQL and Web Service Requests and Responses

To log PSQL and Web Service requests and responses when using the connector, configure a logger:

* For PSQL requests and responses, add this line to the `Loggers` element of the `log4j2.xml` configuration file for the Mule app:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<AsyncLogger name=name="org.mule.service.http.impl.service.HttpMessageLogger"
   level="DEBUG"/>
----
+
* For web service requests and responses, add this line to the `Loggers` element of the `log4j2.xml` configuration file for the Mule app:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<AsyncLogger name="org.apache.cxf.service" level="INFO"/>
----
+
The following example shows the `Loggers` element with the `AsyncLogger` line configured to log web service requests and responses:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Configuration status="WARN">
    <Appenders>
        <Console name="Console" target="SYSTEM_OUT">
            <PatternLayout pattern="%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%t] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n"/>
        </Console>
    </Appenders>
    <Loggers>
        <AsyncLogger name="org.apache.cxf.service" level="INFO" additivity="false">
            <appender-ref ref="Console" level="debug"/>
        </AsyncLogger>
    </Loggers>
</Configuration>
----

== Use Case: Call and Log an Operation

This sample flow calls an operation every 30 seconds and logs its output.

. Drag a Scheduler and set the frequency to 30 seconds.
. Select *Oracle EBS > Get Party Site* from the Mule Palette view and drag it to the flow.
. Configure its input.
. Drag a Logger and set its message to `#[payload]`.

=== Use Case: XML

Here is the code for the aforementioned example:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

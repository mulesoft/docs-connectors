:page-aliases: connectors::cloudhub/cloudhub-connector.adoc

Support Category: https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#anypoint-connectors[Select]

Anypoint Connector for CloudHub (CloudHub Connector) enables you to connect to the CloudHub API from your Mule application.

For information about compatibility and fixed issues, see the xref:release-notes::connector/cloudhub-connector-release-notes-mule-4.adoc[CloudHub Connector Release Notes].


== Create the CloudHub Configuration

The basic CloudHub configuration has the following properties:

* Username +
The user of the Anypoint Platform account
* Password +
The password of the given user
* Environment +
The CloudHub environment to use. By default this is the environment defined as the default in Anypoint Platform.

.Minimum CloudHub Configuration
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<cloudhub:config name="CloudHub_Config" >
  <cloudhub:connection username="${ch.username}" password="${ch.password}" />
</cloudhub:config>
----

== POM File Information

If you create your app outside of Anypoint Studio, update your POM file as follows:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.mulesoft.connectors</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-cloudhub-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
</dependency>
----

Replace `x.x.x` with the version that corresponds to the connector you are using.

To obtain the most up-to-date `pom.xml` file information:

. Go to https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Anypoint Exchange].
. In Exchange, click *Login* and supply your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. In Exchange, search for `hdfs`.
. Click *Dependency Snippets*.

== List Available Environments

After the username and password are configured correctly, you can
retrieve the available environments for easier configuration.

== Use the CloudHub Environment

To specify the app deployment environment, use the <<environment.id-sysprop,`environment.id`>> system property.

.Using the deployment environment
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<cloudhub:config name="CloudHub_Config" >
  <cloudhub:connection
  username="${ch.username}"
  password="${ch.password}"
  environment="${environment.id}"/>
</cloudhub:config>

[[creating-notifications]]
== Creating a Notification

To create a notification, the user must have the Runtime Manager `Read application` permission for the specified environment.

For information about assigning permissions to users, see xref:access-management::users#granting-permissions-and-roles-to-users[Granting Permissions and Roles to Users].

To create a notification, use the Create Notification operation.
This operation requires the notification message and the associated domain.
You can specify the domain using the <<domain-sysprop,`domain`>> system property.

You can also configure:

* *Custom properties*
+
An open object to provide additional information about the created notification
* *Priority*
+
Specify the priority of the notification:
+
** ERROR
** INFO
** WARN
* Transaction ID
+
The transaction ID associated with the created notification

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="cloudhub-connector-flows" >
  <cloudhub:create-notification domain="some-application-name" config-ref="CloudHub_Config"
  transactionId="#[uuid()]" priority="WARN">
   <cloudhub:message >
     <![CDATA[#["Problem occurred trying to process customer data"]]]>
   </cloudhub:message>
   <cloudhub:custom-properties >
     <![CDATA[#[output application/java
---
{
 "customer-id" : "ASD-123",
 "date" : now()
}]]]></cloudhub:custom-properties>
  </cloudhub:create-notification>
 </flow>
----

.Configuring in Studio

[[listing-notifications]]
== List Notifications

To consume notifications, use the List Notifications operation.

This operation requires only that you specify the domain from which to retrieve notifications.
You can specify the domain using the <<domain-sysprop,`domain`>> system property.

You can also configure:

* Limit
+
Specifies the number of notifications to retrieve (default `-1`, which indicates all available notifications)
* Status
+
Filters the notifications to retrieve as unread, read, or all (default `unread`, which retrieves only notifications marked as unread
* Search
+
Retrieves only notifications that contain the specified text

[source,xml]
----
<cloudhub:list-notifications config-ref="CloudHub_Config" domain="some-application-name"/>
----

.Configuring in Studio
image::cloudhub-list-notifications.png[Listing Notifications]

This operation returns a list of notifications with the following structure:

[[notification-object]]
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
  Notification:
    type: object
    properties:
      id: string
      domain: string
      priority?: string
      read: boolean
      readOn?: datetime
      createdAt: datetime
      href: string
      properties: object
----

[[marking-notification]]
== Mark a Notification as Read

Use the Mark Notification operation to mark the notification as read.

After a notification is consumed, mark a notification as read so that the next time notifications are read, only the unread ones are retrieved.

The Mark Notification operation requires only the notification ID, which you can obtain from the `id` property of a <<notification-object,Notification object>>.

.Example of marking notifications as read
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<cloudhub:list-notifications config-ref="CloudHub_Config" domain="some-application-name"/>
<foreach>
  <cloudhub:mark-notification markAs="READ" config-ref="CloudHub_Config" notificationId="#[payload.id]"/>
</foreach>
----

[[listing-applications]]
== List Applications

Using the connector, you can retrieve all available applications in the given environment. No configuration is required.

[source,xml]
----
<cloudhub:list-applications config-ref="CloudHub_Config"/>
----

You can customize how information is retrieved to get less or more information about the applications.

[[retrieving-app-info]]
== Retrieve an Application

The connector retrieves information about an application's deployment.
The only required configuration is to specify the domain and the application name.
You can specify the domain using the <<domain-sysprop,`domain`>> system property.

[source,xml]
----
<cloudhub:get-application domain="some-application-name" config-ref="CloudHub_Config"/>
----

This operation returns all information about the application deployment.

== Useful CloudHub System Properties

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Information |Usage
|[[domain-sysprop]] Domain |The name of the domain where the application is deployed in CloudHub. | ${domain}
|[[environment.id-sysprop]] Environment |The ID of the environment where the application is deployed. | ${environment.id}
|===

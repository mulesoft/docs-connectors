Anypoint Connector for CloudHub (CloudHub Connector) enables you to create custom notifications inside your flows and exception strategies. You can also manage actions and alerts in your CloudHub instance. 

== Install from Anypoint Exchange

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange *X* icon in the Studio task bar.
. Click *Login* in Exchange and supply your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. In the Exchange window, search for the connector and click *Add to project*.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

== Demo Configuration

Add and configure the CloudHub connector according to the basic setup in xref:runtime-manager::deploying-to-cloudhub.adoc[Deploying to CloudHub].

. In Anypoint Studio, find the *CloudHub* connector on the right menu and then drag and drop it next to the *Set Payload* transformer:

+
. Open the configuration for the CloudHub connector. Create a new *Connector Configuration* for the connector by clicking the plus sign "*+*":
+

+
. For this demo, select *Basic Authentication* configuration, which must be configured with the corresponding *Username* and *Password*.
+
[IMPORTANT]
*Inherited Token Authentication* is a configuration option that works only when the CloudHub connector's application runs inside a CloudHub instance. The connector retrieves the API token based on the user who first created the application. If the user who created the application was previously deleted, this authentication method fails.
+
. Enter your Anypoint Platform credentials into the configuration fields and click *OK*. The *Url* field specifies the path to CloudHub in an Anypoint Platform control plane. For example, you can change the *Url* field to access the EU control plane at `+https://eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/+`.
+

+
. Make sure that you have selected the *Create notification* operation and set the properties for:
** *Domain*: The domain you set for your application when you first created it. This is not the complete domain name `myapp.cloudhub.io`, but only the application name, such as `myapp`.
** *Message*: The message you want your notification to display, for example, `Hello World!`.
** *Priority*: The type of the notification. If you select `INFO`, your notification displays an informative message. If you select `ERROR`, your notification displays a red alert message.

+
. You can include additional information with the notification by configuring the *Custom Properties* section.
+
[NOTE]
The custom properties format is `Map <String, String>` and is typically referenced using a Java bean or a variable where you have defined a map, for example, `#[flowVars.magicMap]`, or by defining a map using the `#[['key1':'value1']]` Mule Expression Language (MEL) format.
+
. At this point, your application is ready to deploy and run. When users visit your domain root, the *Create notification* operation in the CloudHub connector displays a `Hello World!` notification message for the domain on which the application runs.

[IMPORTANT]
To create notifications in CloudHub, use the `Create notification` operation. This operation requires that you configure the connector with your Anypoint Platform username and password.

[NOTE]
The Retrieve Logs operation is no longer supported. To download logs, use the CloudHub API or the Anypoint Platform CLI.

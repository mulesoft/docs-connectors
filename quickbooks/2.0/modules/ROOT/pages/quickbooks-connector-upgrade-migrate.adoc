== Upgrade Prerequisites

Before you perform the upgrade, you must:

. Create a backup of your files, data, and configuration in case you need to restore to the previous version.
. Install Quickbooks Connector v2.x to replace the Quickbooks operations that were previously included in Quickbooks Connector v1.x.

== Upgrade Steps

Follow these steps to perform the upgrade:

. In Anypoint Studio, create a Mule project.
. In *Mule Palette*, click *Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Dependencies to Project*, enter `quickbooks` in the search field.
. In *Available modules*, select *Quickbooks Connector - Mule 4* and click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.
. Verify that the `quickbooks-connector` dependency version is `2.x.x` in the `pom.xml` file in the Mule project.

Studio upgrades the connector automatically.


=== Verify the Upgrade

After you install the latest version of the connector, follow these steps to verify the upgrade:

. In Studio, verify that there are no errors in the *Problems* or *Console* views.
. Verify that there are no problems in the project `pom.xml` file.
. Test the connection to verify that the operations work.

== Troubleshooting

If there are problems with caching the parameters and caching the metadata, try restarting Studio.

=== Revert the Upgrade

If it is necessary to revert to the previous version of Quickbooks Connector, change the `quickbooks-connector` dependency version in the project's `pom.xml` file to the previous version.

You must update the project's `pom.xml` file in Anypoint Studio.

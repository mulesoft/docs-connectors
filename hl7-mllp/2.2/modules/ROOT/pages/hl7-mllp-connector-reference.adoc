| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | Name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | |x
| Connection a| <<mllp-listener-config_mllp-listener, MLLP Listener>>
| Connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | |x
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before Mule considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the instance expires at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. Mule purges the instances when appropriate.|  |

[[mllp-listener-config_mllp-listener]]
=== MLLP Listener Connection Type

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Delimiter a| String |  Character code that separates MLLP messages. By default, MLLP uses `001C`. |  |x
| TLS Configuration a| <<TLS>> |  Uses SSLServerSocket instead of plain TCPServerSocket for accepting new SSL connections. |  |
| Port a| Number |  Connection's port number. |  |x
| Host a| String |  Connection's host name. |  |x
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  Configures a reconnection strategy to use when a connector operation fails to connect to an external server.
 |  |
| Send Buffer Size a| Number |  Size of the buffer used when sending data, in bytes. This is set on the socket. |  |
| Receive Buffer Size a| Number |  Size of the buffer used when receiving data, in bytes. This is set on the socket. |  |
| Client Timeout a| Number |  SO_TIMEOUT value on the socket, which indicates the amount of time, in milliseconds, that the socket waits in a blocking operation before it fails. A value of `0` means that the socket waits indefinitely. | 0 |
| Reuse Address a| Boolean |  If `true`, SO_REUSEADDRESS is set on the socket before binding. This helps reduce `address already in use` errors when a socket is reused. |  true |
| Send TCP With No Delay a| Boolean | If `true`, transmitted data is sent immediately instead of collected together for greater efficiency. This value defaults to `true` even though the socket default is false because reducing the amount of network traffic over latency is not usually a concern today. |  true |
| Linger a| Number |  SO_LINGER value, in milliseconds, which indicates how long the socket takes to close so that remaining data is transmitted correctly. |  |
| Keep Alive a| Boolean | If `true`, enables SO_KEEPALIVE behavior on open sockets. This automatically checks socket connections that are open, but unused, for long periods and closes them if the connection becomes unavailable. This is set on the socket. It is used by a server socket to control whether connections to the server are kept alive before they are recycled. |  false |
| Fail On Unresolved Host a| Boolean |  Whether the socket fails during its creation if the host set on the endpoint can't be resolved. Set this value to `false` to allow unresolved hosts (useful when connecting through a proxy). |  true |
|Connection Count |Number | Number of connections accepted at one time. This value can be an integer or DataWeave expression. An empty value, negative value, or value of `0` indicates that the connector can accept an unlimited number of connections. | |
| Server Timeout a| Number |  SO_TIMEOUT value when the socket is used as a server. This is the timeout that applies to the accept operation. A value of `0` (the ServerSocket default) causes the accept to wait indefinitely if no connection arrives. |  |
| Receive Backlog a| Number |  Maximum queue length for incoming connections. |  50 |

| Max Redelivery Count a| Number | Maximum number of times that a redelivered request can be processed unsuccessfully before returning a `REDELIVERY_EXHAUSTED` error. |  |
| Use Secure Hash a| Boolean | If `true`, Mule uses a secure hash algorithm to identify a redelivered message. |  |
| Message Digest Algorithm a| String | Secure hashing algorithm to use if the *Use Secure Hash* field is `true`. If the payload of the message is a Java object, Mule ignores this value and returns the value that the payload’s `hashCode()` returned. |  |

[[repeatable-file-store-stream]]
=== Repeatable File Store Stream

Configures the repeatable file-store streaming strategy by which Mule runtime keeps a portion of the stream content in memory. If the stream content is larger than the configured buffer size, Mule backs up the buffer’s content to disk and then clears the memory.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max In Memory Size a| Number a| Maximum amount of memory that the stream can use for data. If the amount of memory exceeds this value, Mule buffers the content to disk. To optimize performance:

* Configure a larger buffer size to avoid the number of times Mule needs to write the buffer on disk. This increases performance, but it also limits the number of concurrent requests your application can process, because it requires additional memory.
* Configure a smaller buffer size to decrease memory load at the expense of response time.|  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | Unit for the *Max In Memory Size* field. |  |
|===

[[repeatable-in-memory-stream]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Stream

Configures the in-memory streaming strategy by which the request fails if the data exceeds the maximum buffer size. Always run performance tests to find the optimal buffer size for your specific use case.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | Initial amount of memory to allocate to the data stream. If the streamed data exceeds this value, the buffer expands by *Buffer Size Increment*, with an upper limit of the *Max In Memory Size* value. |  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | Amount by which the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of `0` or lower specifies that the buffer can't expand. |  |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | Maximum size of the buffer. If the buffer size exceeds this value, Mule raises a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error. A value of less than or equal to `0` means no limit. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | Unit for the *Initial Buffer Size*, *Buffer Size Increment*, and *Max Buffer Size* fields. |  |
|===

* `true`
+
Use the method that wasn't specified in the *Prefer Crls* field (the secondary method) to check certificate validity.
+
* `false`
+
Do not use the secondary method to check certificate validity.
|  |
| Soft Fail a| Boolean a| What to do if the revocation server can't be reached or is busy:

* `true`
+
Avoid verification failure.
+
* `false`
+
Allow the verification to fail. |  |

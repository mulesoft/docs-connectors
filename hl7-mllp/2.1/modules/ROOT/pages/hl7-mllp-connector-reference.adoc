[[mllp-listener-config]]
== MLLP Listener Configuration

=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | |x
| Connection a| <<mllp-listener-config_mllp-listener, MLLP Listener>>
| The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | |x
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform expires an instance at the exact moment it becomes eligible. The runtime purges instances only when it sees fit. |  |
|===

[[mllp-listener-config_mllp-listener]]
== MLLP Listener Connection Type

=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Delimiter a| String |  Character code that separates MLLP messages. By default MLLP uses 001C. |  |x
| TLS Configuration a| <<TLS>> |  Specifies the use of SSLServerSocket instead of plain TCP ServerSocket for accepting new SSL connections. |  |
| Port a| Number |  Connection's port number. |  |x
| Host a| String |  Connection's host name. |  |x
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to true, deployment fails if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy. |  |
| Send Buffer Size a| Number |  Size of the buffer in bytes used when sending data, set on the socket itself. |  |
| Receive Buffer Size a| Number |  Size of the buffer in bytes used when receiving data, set on the socket itself. |  |
| Client Timeout a| Number |  Sets the SO_TIMEOUT value on sockets. Indicates the amount of time in milliseconds that the socket waits in a blocking operation before failing. A value of 0 (the default) means waiting indefinitely. |  |
| Reuse Address a| Boolean |  If set (the default), SO_REUSEADDRESS is set on the sockets before binding. This helps reduce "address already in use" errors when a socket is re-used. |  true |
| Send TCP With No Delay a| Boolean |  If set, transmitted data is not collected together for greater efficiency but sent immediately. Defaults to true even though Socket default is false because optimizing to reduce amount of network traffic over latency is hardly ever a concern today. |  true |
| Linger a| Number |  This sets the SO_LINGER value. This is related to how long in milliseconds the socket takes to close so that any remaining data is transmitted correctly. |  |
| Keep Alive a| Boolean |  Enables SO_KEEPALIVE behavior on open sockets. This automatically checks socket connections that are open but unused for long periods and closes them if the connection becomes unavailable. This is a property on the socket itself and is used by a server socket to control whether connections to the server are kept alive before they are recycled. |  false |
| Fail On Unresolved Host a| Boolean |  Whether the socket should fail during its creation if the host set on the endpoint cannot be resolved. However, it can be set to false to allow unresolved hosts (useful when connecting through a proxy). |  true |
| Server Timeout a| Number |  This sets the SO_TIMEOUT value when the socket is used as a server. This is the timeout that applies to the "accept" operation. A value of 0 (the ServerSocket default) causes the accept to wait indefinitely (if no connection arrives). |  |
| Receive Backlog a| Number |  The maximum queue length for incoming connections. |  50 |

| Port a| Number | Connection's port number. |  | x
| Host a| String | Connection's host name. |  | x

[[PoolingProfile]]
=== Pooling Profile

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Active a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can be borrowed from a session at one time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of components that may be active at one time. When maxActive is exceeded, the pool is said to be exhausted. |  |
| Max Idle a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can sit idle in the pool at any time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of Mule components that may be idle at one time. |  |
| Max Wait a| Number | Specifies the number of milliseconds to wait for a pooled component to become available when the pool is exhausted and the exhaustedAction is set to WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT. |  |
| Min Eviction Millis a| Number | Determines the minimum amount of time an object may sit idle in the pool before it is eligible for eviction. When non-positive, no objects are evicted from the pool due to idle time alone. |  |
| Eviction Check Interval Millis a| Number | Specifies the number of milliseconds between runs of the object evictor. When non-positive, no object evictor is executed. |  |
| Exhausted Action a| Enumeration, one of:

** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW
** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT
** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL | Specifies the behavior of the Mule component pool when the pool is exhausted. Possible values are: "WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL", which throws a NoSuchElementException, "WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT", which blocks by invoking Object.wait(long) until a new or idle object is available, or WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW, which  creates a new Mule instance and returns it, essentially making maxActive meaningless. If a positive maxWait value is supplied, it blocks for at most that many milliseconds, after which a NoSuchElementException is thrown. If maxThreadWait is a negative value, it blocks indefinitely. |  |
| Initialization Policy a| Enumeration, one of:

** INITIALISE_NONE
** INITIALISE_ONE
** INITIALISE_ALL | Determines how components in a pool should be initialized. The possible values are: INITIALISE_NONE (does not load any components into the pool on startup), INITIALISE_ONE (loads one initial component into the pool on startup), or INITIALISE_ALL (loads all components in the pool on startup). |  |
| Disabled a| Boolean | Whether pooling should be disabled. |  |

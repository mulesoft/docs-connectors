Scripting module executes custom logic written in a scripting language. In some cases, you might need to create custom code to perform all or part of a complex task, or to reuse modules that you have already written.
Starting with Scripting module version 2.0, you must provide a compliant `jsr-223` scripting language engine.


== Prerequisites

To use this module, you must be familiar with:

* Anypoint Connectors
* Mule runtime engine (Mule)
* Elements in a Mule flow
* Global elements
* Creating a Mule app using Design Center or Anypoint Studio

Before creating an app, you must have access to Anypoint Platform.


== Common Use Cases for the Module

Scripting module performs logic in a supported language, which enables you to access variables and the registry, log information via the Mule logger, read payloads, and so on.

For examples, see xref:scripting-module-examples.adoc[Examples].

== Audience

* New user, read:
** xref:scripting-module-studio.adoc[Using Anypoint Studio to Configure the Connector] to create your Mule app
** xref:scripting-module-examples.adoc[Examples], which provides one or more use cases for the connector


* Advanced user, read:
** xref:scripting-module-xml-maven.adoc[XML and Maven Support]
** xref:scripting-module-examples.adoc[Examples], which provides one or more use cases for the connector

For a major or minor release, see xref:scripting-module-upgrade-migrate.adoc[Upgrade and Migrate].


== Next Step

After you complete the prerequisites and experiment with templates and examples, you are ready to create an app and configure the connector using xref:scripting-module-studio.adoc[Anypoint Studio].

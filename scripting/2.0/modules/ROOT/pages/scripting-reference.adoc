|===

== Operations

[[Execute]]

[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^80%", options="header"]
|===
| Name              | Type                  | Description
| payload            | Object                | The payload of the message processed.
| dataType           |                       | Data type of the message payload.
| correlationId      | String                | The correlationId of the message processed.
| attributes         | Map<String, Object>   | Attributes of the Mule message processed.
| vars               | Map<String, Object>   | The variables set on the current Mule event processed.
| message            |                       | The message processed.
| error              |                       | Error associated with the Mule message processed.
| authentication     |                       | Information about the authentication.
| flow               | String                | The name of the current flow.
| log                | Logger                | Logger object that logs to the app's log file, `MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`
| result             | Object                | Variable representing the result of the script execution.
| registry | org.mule.runtime.api.artifact.Registry | Use the registry object to access any other service within the Mule API.
|===

[NOTE]
If the code doesn't produce an implicit result, you have to set the `result` variable value explicitly with the execution result. The payload is set with this value unless you configure a xref:mule-runtime::target-variables.adoc[target variable] as described in xref:scripting-module.adoc[Scripting Module] documentation.


==== Parameters
[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%,.^20%,^.^5%", options="header"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Code a| String |  The script source code to execute |  |x
| Engine a| String |  Name of the scripting engine for running this script |  |x
| Parameters a| Map<String, Object> |  Variables provided to the script as bindings |  |
| Target Variable a| String |  The name of a variable on which the operation's output is placed |  |
| Target Value a| String |  An expression that is evaluated against the operation's output and the outcome of that expression is stored in the target variable |  #[payload] |
|===

IMPORTANT: You must export the classes used with the Scripting Module, otherwise, the execution fails with a `SCRIPTING:COMPILATION` error. See xref:mule-runtime::how-to-export-resources.adoc[how to export resources].

==== Throws

* SCRIPTING:COMPILATION
* SCRIPTING:UNKNOWN_ENGINE
* SCRIPTING:EXECUTION

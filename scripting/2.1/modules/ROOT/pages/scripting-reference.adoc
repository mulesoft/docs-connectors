Scripting Module v2.1

The Scripting module executes custom logic written in a scripting language.

== Configurations
---
[[Config]]
=== Config


Default configuration


==== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x
|===

== Operations

[[Execute]]
=== Execute
`<scripting:execute>`

Run a script with provided code, according to the engine and passing parameters. The script provides many binding variables to work with:

[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^80%", options="header"]
|===
| Name              | Type                  | Description
| payload            | Object                | The payload of the message processed.
| dataType           |                       | Data type of the message payload.
| correlationId      | String                | The correlationId of the message processed.
| attributes         | Map<String, Object>   | Attributes of the Mule message processed.
| vars               | Map<String, Object>   | The variables set on the current Mule event processed.
| message            |                       | The message processed.
| error              |                       | Error associated with the Mule message processed.
| authentication     |                       | Information about the authentication.
| flow               | String                | The name of the current flow.
| log                | Logger                | Logger object that logs to the app's log file, `MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`
| result             | Object                | Variable representing the result of the script execution.
| registry | org.mule.runtime.api.artifact.Registry | Use the registry object to access any other service within the Mule API.
|===

[NOTE]
If the code doesn't produce an implicit result, you have to set the `result` variable value explicitly with the execution result. The payload is set with this value unless you configure a xref:mule-runtime::target-variables.adoc[target variable] as described in xref:index.adoc[Scripting Module Overview].


==== Parameters
[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%,.^20%,^.^5%", options="header"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Code a| String |  The script source code to execute |  |x
| Engine a| String |  Name of the scripting engine for running this script |  |x
| Parameters a| Map<String, Object> |  Variables provided to the script as bindings |  |
| Target Variable a| String |  The name of a variable on which to place the operation’s output |  |
| Target Value a| String |  An expression to evaluate against the operation’s output. The outcome of that expression will be stored in the target variable. |  #[payload] |
|===

IMPORTANT: You must export the classes used with the Scripting Module, otherwise, the execution fails with a `SCRIPTING:COMPILATION` error. See xref:mule-runtime::how-to-export-resources.adoc[how to export resources].

==== Throws

* SCRIPTING:COMPILATION
* SCRIPTING:UNKNOWN_ENGINE
* SCRIPTING:EXECUTION

== Types
[[AggregationAttributes]]
=== Aggregation Attributes

[cols=".^20%,.^25%,.^30%,.^15%,.^10%", options="header"]
|======================
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Aggregation Id a| String | Aggregation ID that comes from the event's message correlationId.
 If the aggregator does not aggregate by correlationId, then this field is an autogenerated value for the
 current aggregated group. |  | x
| First Item Arrival Time a| Number | Time in which the first aggregated value arrived. |  | x
| Last Item Arrival Time a| Number | Time in which the last aggregated element arrived. |  | x
| Is Aggregation Complete a| Boolean | A boolean value that indicates the completion of the aggregation. | false | 
|======================

[[RedeliveryPolicy]]
=== Redelivery Policy

Configures the redelivery policy for executing requests that generate errors. You can add a redelivery policy to any source in a flow. 

[cols=".^20%,.^25%,.^30%,.^15%,.^10%", options="header"]
|======================
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Redelivery Count a| Number | Maximum number of times that a redelivered request can be processed unsuccessfully before returning a REDELIVERY_EXHAUSTED error. |  | 
| Use Secure Hash a| Boolean | If `true`, Mule uses a secure hash algorithm to identify a redelivered message. |  | 
| Message Digest Algorithm a| String | Secure hashing algorithm to use if the <b>Use Secure Hash<b/> field is `true`. If the payload of the message is a Java object, Mule ignores this value and returns the value that the payload’s `hashCode()` returned. |  | 
| Id Expression a| String | One or more expressions that determine when a message was redelivered. This property can be set only if the <b>Use Secure Hash</b> field is `false`. |  | 
| Object Store a| ObjectStore | Configures the object store that stores the redelivery counter for each message. |  |

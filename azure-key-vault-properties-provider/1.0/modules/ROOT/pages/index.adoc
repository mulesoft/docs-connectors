* The Azure Key Vault API
* Anypoint Connectors
* Mule runtime engine (Mule)
* Elements and global elements in a Mule flow
* How to create a Mule app using Anypoint Studio

== Important - Known Issue
A problem has been identified where both the ´Secure Properties Provider´ and the ´Azure Key Vault Properties Provider´ share the same project structure, resulting in both exporting the ´com.mulesoft.modules.configuration.properties.api´ package. This causes deployment failures in Mule applications that says ´DuplicateExportedPackageException: There are multiple artifacts exporting the same package´, as the runtime class loader enforces the rule that two different extensions cannot export the same package.

*Solution:* This issue has been resolved in version 2 of the Azure Key Vault Properties Provider. Customers are advised to upgrade to version 2.0.0 or later to avoid this problem and ensure successful deployment of their Mule applications.

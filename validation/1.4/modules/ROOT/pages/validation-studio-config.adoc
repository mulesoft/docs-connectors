= Using Anypoint Studio to Configure Validation Module 1.4 - Mule 4

Anypoint Studio (Studio) editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.

To add and configure a connector in Studio:

. <<create-mule-project,Create a Mule project>>.
. <<add-connector-to-project,Add the connector to your Mule project>>.
. <<configure-input-source,Configure a source for the connector's flow>>.
. <<add-connector-operation,Add a connector operation to the flow>>.
. <<configure-global-element,Configure a global element for the connector>>.
. <<configure-other-fields,Configure the other connector fields>>.

When you run the connector, you can view the app log to check for problems, as described in <<view-app-log,View the App Log>>.


If you are new to configuring connectors in Studio, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-config-use-studio.adoc[Using Anypoint Studio to Configure a Connector]. If, after reading this topic, you need additional information about the connector fields, see the xref:validation-documentation.adoc[Validation Module Reference].

[[create-mule-project]]
== Create a Mule Project

In Studio, create a new Mule project in which to add and configure the connector:

. In Studio, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
. Enter a name for your Mule project and click *Finish*.


[[add-connector-to-project]]
== Add the Connector to Your Mule Project

Add Validation module to your Mule project to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location and to add the required dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In the *Add Dependencies to Project* window, type `validation` in the search field.
. Click *Validation Module* in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.


[[configure-input-source]]
== Configure a Source

A source initiates a flow when a specified condition is met.
You can configure one of these input sources to use with Validation Module:

* *HTTP > Listener* +
Initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port
* *Scheduler* +
Initiates a flow when a time-based condition is met

For example, to configure an HTTP listener, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *HTTP > Listener*.
. Drag *Listener* to the Studio canvas.
. On the *Listener* configuration screen, optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. Specify a value for the *Path* field.
. Click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of *HTTP Listener* in the app.
. On the *General* tab, specify the connection information for the connector.
. On the *TLS* tab, optionally specify the TLS information for the connector.
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

[[add-connector-operation]]
== Add a Connector Operation to the Flow

When you add a connector operation to your flow, you immediately define a specific operation for that connector to perform.

To add an operation for Validation module, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *Validation* and then select the desired operation.
. Drag the operation onto the Studio canvas and to the right of the source.

[[configure-global-element]]
== Configure a Global Element for the Connector

When you configure a connector, it’s best to configure a global element that all instances of that connector in the app can use. Configuring a global element requires you to provide the authentication credentials that the connector requires to configure I18n for the standard error messages.

To configure the global element for Validation module, follow these steps:

. Select the name of the module in the Studio canvas.
. Select the operation in the Studio canvas.
. In the configuration screen for the operation, click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Module configuration* field to access the global element configuration fields.
. On the *General* tab, for *I18n*, select one of the following options:
+
* *None*
* *Expression*
* *Edit inline*
* *Global reference*
+
If you select *Edit Inline*, set the following parameters:

* *Bundle path* +
The path to a bundle file containing the messages. If null, then Anypoint Platform chooses a default one.
* *Locale* +
If null, Anypoint Platform chooses the system default.

[start=5]
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify expiration policy configuration.
. Click *OK*.

[[view-app-log]]
== View the App Log

To check for problems, you can view the app log as follows:

* If you’re running the app from Anypoint Platform, the output is visible in the Anypoint Studio console window.
* If you’re running the app using Mule from the command line, the app log is visible in your OS console.

Unless the log file path is customized in the app’s log file (`log4j2.xml`), you can also view the app log in the default location `MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`.

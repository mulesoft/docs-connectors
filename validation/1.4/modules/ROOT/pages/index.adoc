= Validation Module 1.4 - Mule 4
:page-aliases: connectors::validation/validation-connector.adoc

Support Category: https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#anypoint-connectors[Select]

The Validation module verifies that the content of a message in a Mule flow matches specific criteria. If a message does not meet the defined validation criteria, the validation fails and returns a validation error, such as `VALIDATION:INVALID_URL`, which is a `ValidationException`. Based on the specific data you are validating, you can customize the exception message that is displayed in the logs.

== Prerequisites

To use this module, you must be familiar with:

* Anypoint Connectors
* Mule runtime engine (Mule)
* Elements and global elements in a Mule flow
* Creating a Mule app using Anypoint Studio (Studio)

Before creating an app, you must have access to Anypoint Platform and Anypoint Studio.

= Troubleshooting the Validation Module - Mule 4

To troubleshoot the Validation module, become familiar with the information about enabling verbose logging and interpreting commonly thrown messages.

== Enable Verbose Logging

To get a better understanding of why an application's interaction with the Validation module is failing, temporarily enable verbose logging for the module. +

Remember to always disable the enhanced verbosity after troubleshooting, because it affects your Mule application performance.

To enable verbose logging in the configuration file:

. Access Anypoint Studio and navigate to the *Package Explorer* view.
. Open your application's project name.
. Open the `src/main/resources` path folder.
. Open the `log4j2.xml` file inside the folder.
. Add an `<AsyncLogger>` tag inside the `<Loggers>` tag:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
			<Loggers>
				...
				<AsyncLogger name="org.mule.extension.validation" level="DEBUG"/>
				...
			</Loggers>
----
[start=6]
. Save your application changes.
. Click the project name in *Package Explorer* and then click *Run* > *Run As* > *Mule Application*.


== Understand Common Throws

Here is a list of common throw messages and how to interpret them:

* VALIDATION:BLANK_STRING

 The provided value is an empty string and the expected value is not.

* VALIDATION:NOT_BLANK_STRING

 The provided value is not an empty string and the expected value is.

* VALIDATION:ELAPSED_TIME

 Too much time has elapsed since the specified start time.

* VALIDATION:NOT_ELAPSED_TIME

 Not enough time has elapsed since the specified start time.

* VALIDATION:INVALID_EMAIL

 The provided value is an invalid email address.

* VALIDATION:EMPTY_COLLECTION

 The provided value is an empty collection and the expected value is not.

* VALIDATION:NOT_EMPTY_COLLECTION

* VALIDATION:INVALID_IP

 The provided value is an invalid IP address.

* VALIDATION:REJECTED_IP

 The provided value is not valid according to the expecting ranges.

 The value provided is null. Keep in mind that the definition of `null` can vary depending on the mimeType value. For example, for an `application/java` mimeType, `null` means a blank pointer. However, if the mimeType is `application/json`, then the String `null` is also a null value.

* VALIDATION:NOT_NULL

 The value provided is not null. Keep in mind that the definition of `null` can vary depending on the mimeType value. For example, for an `application/java` mimeType, `null` means a blank pointer. However, if the mimeType is `application/json`, then the String `null` is also a null value.

* VALIDATION:INVALID_NUMBER

 The provided value does not satisfy either the number type or the minimum or maximum expected values.

* VALIDATION:INVALID_TIME

 The provided value is an invalid time for the pattern used to parse it. If no pattern is provided, then the locale's default is used.

* VALIDATION:INVALID_URL

* VALIDATION:MISMATCH

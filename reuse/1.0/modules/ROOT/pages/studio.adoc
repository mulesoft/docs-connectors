= Use Studio to Configure <connector-name> <version> - Mule 4

include::connectors::partial$t-studio-topic-intro-partial.adoc[]
////
Anypoint Studio (Studio) editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.

To add and configure a connector in Studio:

. <<create-mule-project,Create a Mule project>>.
. <<add-connector-to-project,Add the connector to your Mule project>>.
. <<configure-source,Configure a source for the connector's flow>>.
. <<add-connector-operation,Add a connector operation to the flow>>.
. <<configure-global-element,Configure a global element for the connector>>.
. <<configure-other-fields,Configure the other connector fields>>.

When you run the connector, you can view the app log to check for problems in real time, as described in <<view-app-log,View the App Log>>.
////

If you are new to configuring connectors in Studio, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-config-use-studio.adoc[Use Studio to Configure a Connector]. If, after reading this topic, you need additional information about the connector fields, see the {page-connector-reference-url}.

include::connectors::partial$t-studio-create-project-sect-partial.adoc[]
////
[[create-mule-project]]
== Create a Mule Project

In Studio, create a new Mule project in which to add and configure the connector:

. In Studio, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
. Enter a name for your Mule project and click *Finish*.
////

[[add-connector-to-project]]
== Add the Connector to Your Mule Project

include::connectors::partial$t-studio-add-connector-sect-intro-partial.adoc[]
////
Add the connector to your Mule project to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location and add the required dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file:
////

. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Modules to Project*, type {page-search-name} in the search field.
. Click {page-service-name} in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.

[[configure-source]]
== Configure a Source

A source initiates a flow when a specified condition is met.
You can configure one of these sources to use with <connector name>:

////
If the connector has connector-specific input sources, list them first, using one bullet for each input source.
////

include::connectors::partial$t-studio-listener-scheduler-bullets-partial.adoc[]
////
* HTTP > Listener
+
Initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port
+
* Scheduler
+
Initiates a flow when a time-based condition is met
////

////
Use one input source as an example. If the connector has a connector-specific input source, use one of those input sources as an example. In the example, list the required and important fields.  If the connector does not have a connector-specific input source, use an HTTP listener, using the text shown below.
////

include::connectors::partial$t-studio-listener-example-steps-partial.adoc[]
////
For example, to configure an HTTP Listener source, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *HTTP > Listener*.
. Drag *Listener* to the Studio canvas.
. On the *Listener* configuration screen, optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. Specify a value for the *Path* field.
. Click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of the HTTP Listener source in the app.
. On the *General* tab, specify the connection information for the connector.
. On the *TLS* tab, optionally specify the TLS information for the connector.
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.
////

[[add-connector-operation]]
== Add a Connector Operation to the Flow

include::connectors::partial$t-studio-add-connector-op-sect-intro-partial.adoc[]
////
When you add a connector operation to your flow, you immediately define a specific operation for that connector to perform.
////

To add an operation for <connector name>, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *<connector name>* and then select the desired operation.
. Drag the operation onto the Studio canvas to the right of the source.

[[configure-global-element]]
== Configure a Global Element for the Connector

When you configure a connector, it's best to configure a global element that all instances of that connector in the app can use. Configuring a global element requires you to provide the authentication credentials that the connector requires to access the target {page-service-name} system.

{page-connector-name} supports <mention the types of authorization the connector supports>.

To configure the global element for {page-connector-name} Connector, follow these steps:

////
The wording of step 3 depends on how many authentication methods the connector uses. If the connector uses only one authentication method, mention it in step 3 and then explain how to configure it in this procedure. If the connector uses multiple authentication methods, mention them in step 3 and then refer to subsections that explain how to configure the authentication methods.
////

. Select the operation in the Studio canvas.
. In the configuration screen for the operation, click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to access the global element configuration fields.
. On the *General* tab, in *Connection*, select the authentication method to configure:
* <<link to authentication method 1>>
* <<link to authentication method 2 and so on>>

+
include::connectors::partial$t-studio-property-placeholder-desc-partial.adoc[]
+
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

////
Example of wording for Basic authentication. This varies by /connector.
////

[[basic_authentication]]
=== Basic Authentication

Enter the following information on the *General* tab of the *Global Element Properties* screen to configure Basic authentication:

[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Field |User Action
|Name |Enter the configuration name.
|Connection | Select `Basic`.
|Session Token | Optionally enter the session token provided by Amazon Security Token Service (STS).
|Access Key | Enter the access key provided by Amazon.
|Secret Key | Enter the secret key provided by Amazon.
|Try Default AWS Credentials Provider Chain | Set to `true` to obtain credentials from the AWS environment.
|Region Endpoint | Select the region endpoint for the service.
|===

The following screenshot shows an example of configuring Basic authentication:

.Basic authentication fields
image::amazon/amazon-dynamodb-basic-authentication.png[To configure authentication, select `Basic` in the *Connection* field and then complete the fields on the *General* tab.]

The first item shows where to specify that the connector uses Basic authentication. The second item shows the *General tab*, which contains fields related to Basic authentication.

////
Example of wording for Role authentication (Amazon connectors only)
////

[[role-authentication]]
=== Role Authentication

Enter the following information on the *General* tab of the global element configuration screen to configure Role authentication:

[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Field |User Action
|Name |Enter the configuration name.
|Connection | Select `Role`.
|Role ARN | Enter the role to assume to gain cross-account access.
|Access Key | Enter the access key provided by Amazon.
|Secret Key | Enter the secret key provided by Amazon.
|Try Default AWS Credentials Provider Chain | Set to `true` to obtain credentials from the AWS environment.
|Region Endpoint | Select the region endpoint for the service.
|===

The following screenshot shows an example of configuring Role authentication:

.Role authentication fields
image::amazon/amazon-dynamodb-role-authentication.png[To configure Role authentication, select `Role` in the *Connection* field and then complete the fields on the *General* tab.]

The first item shows where to specify that the connector uses Role authentication. The second item shows the *General tab*, which contains fields related to Role authentication.

[[configure-other-fields]]
== Configure Additional Connector Fields

// include::connectors::partial$t-studio-config-additional-fields-sect-partial.adoc[]
After you configure a global element for <page-service-name> Connector, configure the other required fields for the connector. The required fields vary depending on which connector operation you use.


////
Use a table like this one to describe the required fields for the connector configuration. For some connectors, you might also want to list important, nonrequired fields.

[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|Table name | Name of the table to create
|Attribute definitions | Attributes that describe the key schema for the table and its indexes
|Key schemas | Attributes compose the primary key for a table or index
|===
////

include::connectors::partial$t-studio-view-app-log-sect-partial.adoc[]
////
[[view-app-log]]
== View the App Log

To check for problems, you can view the app log as follows:

* If you’re running the app from Anypoint Platform, the app log output is visible in the Anypoint Studio console window.
* If you’re running the app using Mule from the command line, the app log output is visible in your OS console.

Unless the log file path is customized in the app’s log file (`log4j2.xml`), you can also view the app log in the default location `MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`.

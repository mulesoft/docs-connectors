== Configure Sending AS2 Messages

This example shows you how to configure an AS2 send message with an MDN request.

. In Anypoint Studio, place AS2 Connector in your flow.
. To send an AS2 message with a request for MDN in your Mule application,
create a global *AS2 Connector Send config* element for use by the AS2 send operations, specify values for the following fields:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Key| Description
|Self config - AS2 Partner Name| Sender’s AS2 system identifier. Used for `AS2-From` and `AS2-To` headers.
|Self config - x509 alias| Sender’s certificate or private key alias in the keystore. Required if using signing or encryption.
|Self config - Email| Sender partner’s email.
|Partner config - AS2 ID| Receiver’s AS2 system identifier. Used for `AS2-From` and `AS2-To` headers.
|Partner config - x509 alias| Receiver’s certificate or private key alias in the keystore. Required if using signing or encryption.
|Partner config - Email| Receiver partner’s email.
|Requester config - Subject| Free-form text for MIME subject header. Can include references to self or partner `simpleName` values along with the message `fileName`, for example, sending the `file example.txt` to partner via AS2.
|Requester config - MDN MIC Signature Algorithm| The algorithm with which MIC is calculated for the MDN signature. `UNSIGNED` by default.
|Requester config - Request a receipt| Option to request a receipt from the partner. `SIGNED_OPTIONAL` by default.
|Requester config - Request delivery URL| Asynchronous receipt delivery URL that points to the MDN listener endpoint.
|Requester config - Encryption Algorithm| The encryption algorithm for encrypting the message. `UNENCRYPTED` by default.
|Requester config - MIC Signature Algorithm| The algorithm with which MIC is calculated for the message signature. `UNSIGNED` by default.
|Requester config - Content transfer encoding| The content transfer encoding. `BINARY` by default.
|Requester config - Compression type| ZLIB is the only supported compression and decompression type. `NONE` by default.
|Keystore config - Keystore Path| The path of the keystore with certificates and keys.
|Keystore config - Keystore Password| The password for the keystore.
|Keystore config - Private key Password| The private key password, if required.
|===

. Configure a connection to the partner AS2 endpoint by providing the *Partner Base URL* value.
. If you want to configure other connection details (such as TLS, proxy, basic authentication, and timeouts), do so now.
. Send the message by using either the *Send with Sync MDN* or *Send with Async MDN* operation:

** `payload` is the message content to send.

** `Filename` is the file name of the message to send.

** The `Boolean` required to configure if the process should fail or if the receipt status is not processed.

. If you choose to request an asynchronous receipt, you must configure `MDN Listener`.

[[configure-mdn-reciept]]
=== Configure an AS2 MDN Listener for Receiving Receipts

This example shows you how to set up the *As 2 mdn listener* source to receive receipts.

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *AS2 > As 2 mdn listener*.
. Drag *As 2 mdn listener* to the Studio canvas and reference the global configuration defined here:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Key| Description
|Self config - AS2 ID| Sender partner’s OID.
|Self config - x509 alias| Sender’s certificate or private key alias in the keystore.
|Self config - Email| Sender partner’s email.
|Partner config - AS2 ID| Receiver partner’s OID.
|Partner config - x509 alias| Receiver’s certificate or private key alias in the keystore.
|Partner config - Email| Receiver partner’s email.
|HTTP Listener config| Reference to HTTP Listener global configuration.
|Keystore config - Keystore Path| The path of the keystore with certificates and keys.
|Keystore config - Keystore Password| The password for the keystore.
|Keystore config - Private key Password| The private key password if required.
|===

[[configure-listener-receive]]
=== Configure an AS2 Listener for Receiving Messages

This example shows you how to configure an *As 2 listener* source to receive MDN requests asynchronously.
 
. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *AS2 > As 2 listener*.
. Drag *As 2  listener* to the Studio canvas and reference the global configuration defined here:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Key| Description
|Self config - AS2 ID| Receiver partner’s OID.
|Self config - x509 alias| Receiver alias as defined in the keystore file.
|Self config - Email| Receiver partner’s email.
|Partner config - AS2 ID| Sender partner’s OID.
|Partner config - x509 alias| Sender alias as defined in the keystore.
|Partner config - Email| Sender partner’s email.
|HTTP Listener config| Reference to HTTP Listener global configuration.
|Keystore config - Keystore Path| The path of the keystore with certificates and keys.
|Keystore config - Keystore Password| The password for the keystore.
|Keystore config - Private key Password| The private key password, if required.
|Inbound Request Authentication| Configure Basic Authentication credentials that are allowed within the incoming request.
|===
+
. Configure a connection to the partner if the MDN request is to be sent asynchronously.
. If you want to configure other connection details (such as TLS, proxy, and timeouts) do that now.

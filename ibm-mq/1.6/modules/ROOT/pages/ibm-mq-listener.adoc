= Listening For New Messages
:keywords: jms, ibm mq, mq, connector, consume, message, source, listener


The Listener source in the IBM MQ and its use of the JMS connector provides the ability to consume messages as
they arrive at the destination.

== Listening for New Messages

The syntax to listen for new messages from a queue is:

[source,xml]
----
<ibm-mq:listener config-ref="config" destination="#[vars.destination]"/>
----

The source listens for new messages in the queue identified by the destination, returning a Mule Message each time a JMS message is available in the queue.

The message contains:

* The message's content as a payload.
* The message's metadata in the message attributes.

By default, the message consumed is acknowledged only when the execution of
the flow receiving the message completes successfully.
If instead, an error occurs during the execution of the flow, the session is
recovered, and the JMS message is redelivered.

For more information regarding a message ACK, see xref:ibm-mq-ack.adoc[Handling Message Acknowledgement].

== Configuring Message Throughput

When extra processing power is needed, the JMS Listener allows you to configure
the `numberOfConsumers` that a given Listener uses to consume messages concurrently.
By default, each Listener uses four consumers to produce messages
concurrently. Since each consumer waits for the message to be processed,
that means that you can have a maximum of four messages in-flight at the same time.
If you need to increase the concurrent message processing, just increase the
`numberOfConsumers` in the Listener.

== Filtering Incoming Messages

The JMS connector provides full support for filtering which Messages should be
consumed based on the standard JMS `selector` language.

For example, if you have a priority Queue with Messages that need to be processed
faster than the others, we can do:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="consumer">
    <ibm-mq:listener config-ref="JMS_config"
    destination="openTickets"
    selector="JMSPriority=8"/>
</flow>
----

When a selector is configured, only the messages matching it are received,
ignoring any other message in the destination.

== MIME Types and Encoding

The JMS connector does its best to automatically determine a message’s MIME type (`contentType`)
based on the MM_MESSAGE_CONTENT_TYPE property. However, there are cases in
which that best guess is not enough, and you need first-hand knowledge of the
message’s content. In such cases, you can force the content type to a particular
value by using the `inboundContentType` parameter.

The same process works for encoding. By default, the connector assumes that
the runtime’s default encoding matches the one in the message if no other
information is provided. You can set this by using the `inboundEncoding` parameter.

== Replying to Incoming Messages

When an incoming JMS message declares a *Reply to* destination, the *On new message* source
automatically produces a response when the message is processed successfully, meaning that no error occurs during the flow execution.
In this case, when the flow completes, a response is published to the
destination specified in the processed message header.

You can configure IBM MQ responses in the *On New message* source with the following XML syntax:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<ibm-mq:listener config-ref="config" destination="#[vars.destination]">
  <ibm-mq:response priority="8" persistentDelivery="true">
      <ibm-mq:body>#['Message received was: ' ++ payload]</ibm-mq:body>
      <ibm-mq:properties>#[{'processedAt': now}]</ibm-mq:properties>
  </ibm-mq:response>
</ibm-mq:listener>
----

The *Reply to* field of the *On New Message* source is not to overwrite the reply to field of the original message, but to set the reply to field of the message that is being sent as a reply.

This response builder allows you to configure not only the `body` and `properties`
of the response message but also allows you to specify any header like `priority` and `persistentDelivery`.
All these configurations impact the outbound message and can be built
using all the information available in the flow when the processing is completed.

Disable the automatic reply by using the `ignoreReplyTo` attribute in the `ibm-mq:response` element:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<ibm-mq:listener config-ref="config" destination="#[vars.destination]">
  <ibm-mq:response priority="8" persistentDelivery="true" ignoreReplyTo="true"/>
</ibm-mq:listener>
----

== Listening for Messages with a Topic Subscription

Listening for messages from a topic destination is very similar to listening for
them from a queue, but with the extra functionality of being able to use topic
subscriptions to share state between consumers.
The syntax for subscribing to a topic is:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<ibm-mq:listener config-ref="JMS_config" destination="#[vars.destination]">
    <ibm-mq:consumer-type>
        <ibm-mq:topic-consumer/>
    </ibm-mq:consumer-type>
</ibm-mq:listener>
----

All the `listener` parameters remain the same, but now you can handle the
subscription configuration in the `topic-consumer` parameter.

For details on how to configure the topic subscriptions see xref:ibm-mq-topic-subscription.adoc[Using Topic Subscriptions].

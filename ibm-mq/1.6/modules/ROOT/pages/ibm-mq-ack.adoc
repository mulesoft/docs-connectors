= Handling Message Acknowledgement
:keywords: jms, connector, consume, message, ack
:page-aliases: connectors::ibm/ibm-mq-ack.adoc

There are different acknowledgement configurations provided by the JMS connector.

== Automatic Acknowledgement On Success

The `AUTO ackMode` can be used in the `ibm-mq:listener` component, causing
the automatic ACK of the received message *if and only if* the flow execution completes successfully.
If an error occurs during the flow execution that causes it to
terminate prematurely, then the message is not acknowledged and redelivery occurs.

Another `ackMode` similar to `AUTO` is `DUPS_OK`. With `DUPS_OK` the message
is acknowledged automatically upon the success of the flow execution but in a
lazy fashion which may lead to duplicates since the message may be redelivered
before the ACK is performed.

== Immediate Acknowledgement

Setting the `ackMode` to `IMMEDIATE` either in `ibm-mq:listener` or `ibm-mq:consume`
operations causes the message to be automatically acknowledged once it is consumed,
and prior to any processing of the message by the application.
Having the message automatically acknowledged after it is received means that the
message won't be redelivered if any error occurs during the processing of the
message, so application logic like a dead letter queue has to be created to handle
errors without losing messages.

== Manual Acknowledgement

As you may expect, the `MANUAL` `ackMode` delegates all the responsibility of
performing the ACK on the message to the application logic.

With this configuration, every message received by either the `listener` or
`consume` operations has an `ackId` available in the Mule Message `attributes`
which identifies this message uniquely for a given connection.

The `ackId` that identifies the message passes to the `ibm-mq:ack` operation:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="consumerWithManualAck">
    <ibm-mq:consume config-ref="JMS_config" destination="openTickets" ackMode="MANUAL"/>

    <!--Do message processing-->
    <logger message="#[payload]">

    <ibm-mq:ack ackId="#[attributes.ackId]"/>
</flow>
----


=== Manual Session Recovery

When using the `MANUAL ackMode`, all messages that are received but not
acknowledged won't be redelivered by the broker.
If an error occurs during the message processing that prevents it
from being acknowledged, the user is responsible for manually recovering all the
messages in the session that have to be redelivered using the `recover-session` operation:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="consumerWithManualAck">
    <ibm-mq:consume config-ref="JMS_config" destination="${destination}"
                 ackMode="MANUAL" target="consumedMessage" targetValue="#[message]"/>

    <!--Do message processing-->
    <logger message="#[payload]">

    <ibm-mq:ack ackId="#[vars.consumedMessage.attributes.ackId]"/>

    <error-handler>
        <on-error-propagate>
            <!--In case of error, recover the session-->
            <ibm-mq:recover-session ackId="#[vars.consumedMessage.attributes.ackId]"/>
        </on-error-continue>
    </error-handler>
</flow>
----

Same as before, the connection used for recovering the session has to be the
same as the one used for receiving the message.

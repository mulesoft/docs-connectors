= Listen For A Reply
:page-aliases: connectors::ibm/ibm-mq-publish-consume.adoc

Request and reply is a widespread pattern between applications, thus the new IBM MQ
connector provides an operation for that called `publish-consume`.
The publish-consume operation allows you to publish a message to any destination,
and then wait for a reply on a different destination.

When using the publish-consume operation, the JMSReplyTo header of the outgoing message
contains the ID of the destination at which an application waits for a
response. This destination may be a well-known destination, or it may be a
temporary destination created on the fly with the only purpose of receiving a
single response message.

The result of the operation is the message received as a response,
with the same structure as if a consume operation was invoked.

== Wait For A Reply On A Temporary Queue

Using a temporary queue to wait for a response is very simple, just configure the
message being sent and the operation automatically waits for a response in a
temporary queue:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<ibm-mq:publish-consume
     config-ref="config"
     destination="targetDestination"
     maximumWait="20"
     maximumWaitUnit="SECONDS"/>
----

In this example, the operation publishes a message with the current payload
as its body and the JMSReplyTo header configured to a temporary destination,
to the `targetDestination`.
Then, it automatically tries to consume the response from that temporary
queue until a message is consumed or the maximumWait is reached (in which case
the operation fails with a IBM-MQ:TIMEOUT error).

== Receive a Reply On a Known Queue

In many cases, reply queues do not need to be created for each request,
but instead a well-known queue can be used for replies.
For this case, all you have to do is to configure the `reply-to` parameter on
the outgoing message:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<ibm-mq:publish-consume config-ref="config"
     destination="targetDestination">
    <ibm-mq:message>
        <ibm-mq:reply-to destination="replyToDestination"/>
    </ibm-mq:message>
</ibm-mq:publish-consume>
----

The operation publishes a message to the `targetDestination` with the
current payload as its body and the JMSReplyTo header configured with
the `replyToDestination`.

The operation automatically tries to consume the response from the
replyToDestination queue until a message is consumed or the maximumWait
is reached (in which case the operation fails with a IBM-MQ:TIMEOUT error).

== Request Reply Patterns

As of IBM MQ connector v1.5.0:

In JMS, there exists two well known request-reply patterns for how request and reply messages
are correlated. This means how to ensure that the incoming message is the proper reply
of the outgoing message.

=== Correlation ID Pattern

This pattern is the default for the Publish Consume Operation, the usage of
this pattern implies that the operation after publishing a message to the
destination queue, will consume a message using a selector that expects a message
with the same Correlation ID to be used to publish the request message.

.Client and Listener IBM MQ Correlation ID pattern implementation
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="publish-consume-correlation-id">
  <ibm-mq:publish-consume config-ref="config"
    destination="targetDestination"
    requestReplyPattern="CORRELATION_ID">
    <ibm-mq:message >
      <ibm-mq:reply-to destination="replyToDestination" />
    </ibm-mq:message>
  </ibm-mq:publish-consume>
  <logger message="Received message from 'replyToDestination' with Correlation ID: #[attributes.headers.correlationId]"/>
</flow>

<flow name="ibm-mq-listener-correlation-id" >
  <ibm-mq:listener config-ref="config" destination="targetDestination">
    <ibm-mq:reply-to-response requestReplyPattern="CORRELATION_ID" />
  </ibm-mq:listener>
  <logger level="INFO" message="About to reply to 'targetDestination' with Correlation ID: #[attributes.headers.correlationId]"/>
</flow>
----

=== Message ID Pattern

Different from the Correlation ID pattern is the Message ID pattern which implies
that the operation after publishing a message to the destination queue, will
consume a message using a selector expecting a message with the a Correlation ID
of the same value as the Message ID of the request message.

.Client and Listener IBM MQ Message ID pattern implementation
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="publish-consume-message-id">
  <ibm-mq:publish-consume config-ref="config"
   destination="targetDestination"
   requestReplyPattern="MESSAGE_ID">
    <ibm-mq:message >
      <ibm-mq:reply-to destination="replyToDestination" />
    </ibm-mq:message>
  </ibm-mq:publish-consume>
  <logger message="Received message from 'replyToDestination' with Correlation ID: #[attributes.headers.correlationId]"/>
</flow>

<flow name="ibm-mq-listener-message-id" >
  <ibm-mq:listener config-ref="config" destination="targetDestination">
    <ibm-mq:reply-to-response requestReplyPattern="MESSAGE_ID" />
  </ibm-mq:listener>
  <logger level="INFO" message="About to reply to 'targetDestination' with Correlation ID: #[attributes.headers.messageId]"/>
</flow>
----

=== None

Also the operation can be configured to not use any of above patterns, and the
consumer will try to consume from the reply queue without using a selector
to correlate messages.

This option is useful when working with temporal queues where it's ensured that
the queue will have only one message.

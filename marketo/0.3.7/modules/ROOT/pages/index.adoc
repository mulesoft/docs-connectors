The *Anypoint Connector for Marketo* is a closed-source connector which provides a connection between Mule and Marketo REST APIs, implementing all the supported v1.0 Marketo API endpoints, including powerful xref:5.x@studio::datasense.adoc[Datasense] functionality.

Marketo connector is a wrapper connector developed with MuleSoft's Anypoint Connector DevKit version 3.8.2.

*Release Notes:* xref:release-notes::connector/marketo-connector-release-notes.adoc[Marketo Connector Release Notes]

[[prerequisites]]
== Before You Begin

This document assumes that you are familiar with the Marketo API.

To use this connector you need a:

* MarketoDB instance with REST support
* Set of valid credentials, including the required Marketo endpoints, pointing to your instance. For more information check http://developers.marketo.com/documentation/getting-started/[this]
* MuleSoft Enterprise License

For hardware and software requirements please visit https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/dl/mule-esb-enterprise[this page].

== Namespace and Schema

When designing your application in Studio, the act of dragging the connector from the palette onto the Anypoint Studio canvas should automatically populate the XML code with the connector *namespace* and *schema location*.

[TIP]
If you are manually coding the Mule application in Studio's XML editor or other text editor, paste these into the header of your *Configuration XML* inside the tags.

=== Namespace

----
xmlns:marketo="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/marketo"
----

=== Schema Location

----
xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/marketo/current/mule-marketo.xsd
..."
----


[[crm]]
=== CRM Integration

Instances that have a native CRM integration enabled will have *Company*, *Opportunity* and *Sales Persons* APIs disabled by Marketo. So while the operations are available for selection, Marketo's API would respond with an error specifying they cannot be used. If you're not sure about their availability in your environment, please use the *Test Connectivity* button in your global configuration for Marketo connector.

[[dependencies]]
== Dependencies

The Marketo connector requires the following:

|===
|Application/Service|Version

|Anypoint Studio|5.4.3
|Mule Runtime|EE 3.7.0 and above
|Java|JDK 7 and above
|===

[[install-and-config]]
== Installing and Configuring

[[install]]
=== Installing

To install the Marketo connector:

. Open Anypoint Studio and got to *Help* > *Install New Software*
* Select `Anypoint Connectors Update Site` or `http://repository.mulesoft.org/connectors/releases/3.5.0`.
. Locate the *Marketo* connector.
. Click *Next* and accept the license agreement.
. Restart Studio when prompted.

For more information on how to install a connector xref:3.7@mule-runtime::installing-connectors.adoc[click here].

After installing the connector, your studio palette should contain the following. It would be useful at this point to filter your palette to show only message processors relating to the Marketo connector.

[[older-version]]
== Upgrading from an Older Version

* Uninstall the previous Marketo Connector.
* Install the latest version of Marketo Connector from the Update site (via *Install New Software* in the *Help* menu in Studio).
* Ensure that the Maven dependencies have been updated correctly from *Marketo[v1.2.5]* to *Marketo[v2.0.0]*.
* Update flows that are using *Phased Out* or *Deprecated operations*.
** Remember that `marketo:config` does *NOT* support the *SOAP* fields anymore. Now you only have *ClientId, Client Secret and Rest Endpoint url*.

[[config-global]]
== Using the Connector

To set up the Global Configuration:

. Go to the *Global Element* tab and click the *Create* button
. Inside the filter textbox enter "Marketo", and select *Marketo: Configuration*, from the *Connector Configuration* directory.
. When you select the global element of your choice, you are presented with the global element properties to enter.
.. The **Client Id** field refers to your launchpoint id.
.. The **Client Secret** field should contain the corresponding secret of your LaunchPoint.
.. The **Rest Endpoint Url** field should contain the url to your REST WebService.

The following screenshot shows the Marketo configuration with Spring property placeholders (for more information see xref:3.7@mule-runtime::configuring-properties.adoc[Configuring Properties]) for the Connection field values. This is the recommended approach when you plan to deploy your application to CloudHub or to a Mule ESB server. However, you may hardcode your connection credentials into the Global Element Properties shown below if you are in the development stage and simply want to speed up the process.

Before testing or running a project that uses the Marketo connector, start adding the following to your project:

* Your Marketo credentials and endpoints in a **.properties** file and load them using the **Property Placeholder** component.
* An inbound endpoint into your flow. For e.g. **HTTP**.
* A *Transform Message* component.
* A transformer e.g. **Object to json**.


[[limitations]]
== Marketo API Limitations

* Only static lists are accessible. Smart lists are not accessible via the API
* Marketo has a daily request limit. You can check this limit in your *Sandbox* > *Admin* > *Web Services*

[[invoke]]
== Invoking an Operation

In order to invoke a simple operation (such as the **Leads | Create Or Update** operation), you can follow these steps:

. From the palette, drag and drop the *Marketo connector* into your flow by placing it between the *Transform Message* and the *Object to JSON Transformer*.
. Configure the connector by selecting the *Connector Configuration* you created in the previous section and choosing the operation to invoke.
. Now, click on *Transform Message*. By the agility of Datasense, you are presented with a list of possible lead fields to use, as available to your Marketo instance.

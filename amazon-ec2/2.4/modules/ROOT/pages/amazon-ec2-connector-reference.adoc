[[copySnapshot]]
=== Copy Snapshot
`<ec2:copy-snapshot>`

Copies a point-in-time snapshot of an EBS volume and stores it in Amazon S3. You can copy the snapshot within the same region, or from one region to another. You can use the snapshot to create EBS volumes or Amazon Machine Images (AMIs).

Copies of encrypted EBS snapshots remain encrypted and copies of unencrypted snapshots remain unencrypted. To encrypt unencrypted snapshots, specify the `Encrypted` parameter during the copy snapshot operation. Encrypted snapshot copies use the default AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK). You can use the `KmsKeyId` parameter to specify a non-default CMK. To copy an encrypted snapshot that is shared from another account, you must have permissions for the CMK that is used to encrypt the snapshot.

Snapshots that are created by the `copySnapshot` action have a random volume ID that must not be used for any other purpose.

[[createSnapshot]]
=== Create Snapshot
`<ec2:create-snapshot>`

Creates a snapshot of an EBS volume and stores it in Amazon S3. You can use snapshots for backups, to make copies of EBS volumes, and to save data before shutting down an instance. When a snapshot is created, any AWS Marketplace product codes that are associated with the source volume are propagated to the snapshot.

You can take a snapshot of an attached volume that is in use, but snapshots capture only the data that is written to your EBS volume at the time the snapshot command is issued. Data that is cached by any apps or the operating system is excluded.

Your snapshot should be complete if you can pause file systems on the volume long enough to take the snapshot.

If you can't pause all file writes to the volume, to ensure a consistent and complete snapshot, do the following:

. Unmount the volume from within the instance.
. Issue the snapshot command.
. Remount the volume. +
You can remount and use your volume while the snapshot status is pending.

Amazon EC2 Connector supports only the following parameters for this operation:

[[createVolume]]
=== Create Volume
`<ec2:create-volume>`

Creates an EBS volume to attach to an instance that is in the same Availability Zone. The volume is created in the regional endpoint to which you send the HTTP request.

This ensures that, no matter which prior snapshots were deleted, all active snapshots have access to all the information needed to restore the volume.

You cannot delete a snapshot of the root device of an EBS volume used by a registered AMI. You must de-register the AMI before you can delete the snapshot.

[[detachVolume]]
=== Detach Volume
`<ec2:detach-volume>`

Detaches an EBS volume from an instance. You must unmount any file systems on the device within your operating system before detaching the volume. Failure to do so can result in the volume becoming stuck in the busy state while detaching. If this happens, detachment can be delayed indefinitely until you unmount the volume, force detachment, reboot the instance, or all three.

If an EBS volume is the root device of an instance, it can't be detached while the instance is running. To detach the root volume, stop the instance first. When a volume with an AWS Marketplace product code is detached from an instance, the product code is no longer associated with the instance.

[[modifyVolumeAttribute]]
=== Modify Volume Attribute
`<ec2:modify-volume-attribute>`

Modifies a volume attribute. By default, all I/O operations for the volume are suspended when the data on the volume is determined to be potentially inconsistent. This behavior prevents undetectable latent data corruption. The I/O access to the volume can be resumed by first enabling I/O access and then checking the data consistency on your volume.

You can change the default behavior to resume I/O operations. It is best to change the default behavior only for boot volumes or for volumes that are stateless or disposable.

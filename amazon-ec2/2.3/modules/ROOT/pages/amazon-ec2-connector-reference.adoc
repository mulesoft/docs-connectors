[[copySnapshot]]
=== Copy Snapshot
`<ec2:copy-snapshot>`

Copies a point-in-time snapshot of an EBS volume and stores it in Amazon S3. You can copy the snapshot within the same region or from one region to another. You can use the snapshot to create EBS volumes or Amazon Machine Images (AMIs).  The snapshot is copied to the regional endpoint that you send the HTTP request to.

Copies of encrypted EBS snapshots remain encrypted. Copies of unencrypted snapshots remain unencrypted, unless the Encrypted flag is specified during the snapshot copy operation.  By default, encrypted snapshot copies use the default AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK); however, you can specify a non-default CMK with the KmsKeyId parameter. To copy an encrypted snapshot that has been shared from another account, you must have permissions for the CMK used to encrypt the snapshot. Snapshots created by the CopySnapshot action have an arbitrary volume ID that should not be used for any purpose.

See Amazon's http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CopySnapshot.html[API reference] for this operation.

[[createSnapshot]]
=== Create Snapshot
`<ec2:create-snapshot>`

Creates a snapshot of an EBS volume and stores it in Amazon S3. You can use snapshots for backups, to make copies of EBS volumes, and to save data before shutting down an instance. When a snapshot is created, any AWS Marketplace product codes that are associated with the source volume are propagated to the snapshot.  You can take a snapshot of an attached volume that is in use. However, snapshots only capture data that has been written to your EBS volume at the time the snapshot command is issued; this may exclude any data that has been cached by any apps or the operating system.

If you can pause any file systems on the volume long enough to take a snapshot, your snapshot should be complete.  However, if you cannot pause all file writes to the volume, you should unmount the volume from within the instance, issue the snapshot command, and then remount the volume to ensure a consistent and complete snapshot. You may remount and use your volume while the snapshot status is pending.

See Amazon's http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateSnapshot.html[API reference] for this operation.

[[deleteSnapshot]]
=== Delete Snapshot
`<ec2:delete-snapshot>`

Deletes the specified snapshot. When you make periodic snapshots of a volume, the snapshots are incremental, and only the blocks on the device that have changed since your last snapshot are saved in the new snapshot.

So regardless of which prior snapshots have been deleted, all active snapshots will have access to all the information needed to restore the volume. You cannot delete a snapshot of the root device of an EBS volume used by a registered AMI. You must first de-register the AMI before you can delete the snapshot.

[[detachVolume]]
=== Detach Volume
`<ec2:detach-volume>`

Detaches an EBS volume from an instance. Make sure to unmount any file systems on the device within your operating system before detaching the volume. Failure to do so can result in the volume becoming stuck in the busy state while detaching. If this happens, detachment can be delayed indefinitely until you unmount the volume, force detachment, reboot the instance, or all three.

If an EBS volume is the root device of an instance, it can't be detached while the instance is running. To detach the root volume, stop the instance first. When a volume with an AWS Marketplace product code is detached from an instance, the product code is no longer associated with the instance.

See Amazon's http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DetachVolume.html[API reference] for this operation.

[[modifyVolumeAttribute]]
=== Modify Volume Attribute
`<ec2:modify-volume-attribute>`

Modifies a volume attribute. By default, all I/O operations for the volume are suspended when the data on the volume is determined to be potentially inconsistent, to prevent undetectable, latent data corruption. The I/O access to the volume can be resumed by first enabling I/O access and then checking the data consistency on your volume. You can change the default behavior to resume I/O operations. We recommend that you change this only for boot volumes or for volumes that are stateless or disposable. See Amazon's http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyVolumeAttribute.html[API reference] for this operation.

| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | The number of instances to initially keep in memory to consume the stream and provide random access to it.

Default value is 100 instances. | `100`  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This is by how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer should not expand, meaning that a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error is raised when the buffer gets full. Default value is 100 instances. |  |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | The maximum amount of memory to use. If more than that is used then a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised. A value lower than or equal to zero means no limit. |  |

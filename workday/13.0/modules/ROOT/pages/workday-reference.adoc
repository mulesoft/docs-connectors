==== Parameters
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x
| Connection a| * <<config_basic-authentication-api, Workday Basic Authentication Connection>>
* <<config_x509-authentication, x.509 Authentication>>
| The connection types to provide to this configuration. | | x
| Time Zone a| String |  Choose your timezone. Time zone needs to be in the format 'UTC+01:00' |  UTC |
| Encoding a| String |  Value that overrides the default Mule encoding value. The value must be one of the standard encoding values, for example, `UTF-8`. |  |

| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> | Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before Mule considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the instance expires at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. Mule purges the instances as appropriate. |  |
|===

=== Connection Types

Connection authentication types to provide to this configuration.

[[config_basic-authentication-api]]
==== Workday Basic Authentication Connection

Uses your Workday username and password for authenticating the connection.

===== Parameters
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|======================
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Proxy Configuration a| One of:

* <<Default>>
* <<NTLM>> |  |  |
| Password a| String |  Password associated with the User Name |  | *x*
| Host name a| String |  Host name of your Workday instance |  `impl-cc.workday.com` |
| Tenant name a| String |  Workday tenant name or ID. Use expressions in this field to configure a connection for multiple tenants. |  | *x*
| User Name a| String |  User name |  | *x*
| Use Persistent Connections a| Boolean |  If false, each connection is closed after the first request is completed. |  true |
| Max Connections a| Number |  Maximum number of outbound connections to keep open concurrently. By default, the number of connections is unlimited. |  -1 |
| Connection Idle Timeout a| Number | Amount of time that a connection can remain idle before it is closed. The value of this attribute is used only when persistent connections are enabled. |  30 |
| Connection Idle Timeout Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Time unit for Connection Idle Timeout |  SECONDS |
| Stream Response a| Boolean |  Whether or not to stream received responses, meaning processing continues as soon as all headers are parsed and the body is streamed as it arrives. When enabled, the response must eventually be read since, depending on the configured buffer size, it might not fit into memory and processing stops until space is available. |  false |
| Response Buffer Size a| Number |  The space, in bytes, for the buffer where the HTTP response is stored. |  -1 |
| Connection Timeout a| Number |  The number of units that a connection can remain idle before it is closed. The value of this attribute is used only when persistent connections are enabled. |  30 |

| TLS Configuration a| <<Tls>> |  Defines a configuration for TLS, which can be used from both the client and server sides to secure communication for the Mule app. When using the HTTPS protocol, the HTTP communication is secured using TLS or SSL. If HTTPS is configured as the protocol then the user needs to configure at least the keystore in the `tls:context` child element of the `listener-config`. |  |
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to `true`, deployment fails if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy. |  |

[[repeatable-in-memory-stream]]
=== Repeatable In-Memory Stream

When streaming in this mode, Mule does not use the disk to buffer the contents. If you exceed the buffer size, the message fails.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | The amount of memory that is allocated to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can be fit into this buffer, then the buffer expands according to the Buffer Size Increment field, with an upper limit of maxInMemorySize. |  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This is by how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer should not expand, meaning that a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised when the buffer gets full. |  |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | The maximum amount of memory to use. If more than that is used, then a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised. A value lower than or equal to zero means no limit. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which all these attributes are expressed |  |
|===

[[repeatable-file-store-stream]]
=== Repeatable File Store Stream

File store repeatable streams require buffering, and there are different buffering strategies. Mule keeps a portion of contents in memory. If the stream contents are larger than the configured buffer size, Mule backs up the buffer’s content to disk and then clears the memory.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| In Memory Size a| Number | Defines the maximum memory that the stream should use to keep data in memory. If more than that is consumed, then it will start to buffer the content on disk. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which maxInMemorySize is expressed |  |

*_Enterprise_*

The *Workday Connector* facilitates connections between Mule integration applications and http://www.workday.com[Workday] by allowing you to connect to a Workday database. It is a Standard connector, meaning that you can deploy it into production if you have an Mule Enterprise license or an Anypoint Platform account.

The Workday Connector provides access to 13 different modules in the Workday database. It allows you to perform a large set of actions for each module, including inserting, querying, and deleting elements.

*Release Notes*: xref:release-notes::connector/workday-connector-release-notes.adoc[Workday Connector Release Notes]

This document describes implementation examples within the context of Anypoint Studio, Mule’s graphical user interface, and, in parallel, includes configuration details for doing the same in the XML Editor.

== Installing the Connector in Studio

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio taskbar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange.
. Search for the connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

When Studio has an update, a message displays in the lower right corner, which you can click to install the update.

However, to use the Workday Connector in a production environment, you must have *either*:

* An *Enterprise license* to use Mule
* A *CloudHub* Starter, Professional, or Enterprise account

Contact the mailto:info@mulesoft.com[MuleSoft Sales Team] to obtain either of these.

Click *Restart Now* to complete the installation. Once you have installed the connector and restarted Studio you can see several new message processors available in the palette, all under the Connectors category.

Alternatively you can also http://mulesoft.github.io/workday-connector/guide/install[install this extension via Maven].

== Configuring the Workday Human Resource Connector

All of the examples on this document focuses on the *Workday Human Resource* message processor.

To use the Workday Connector, you must configure two things:

* The instance of the connector in your application
* A global Workday Human Resource connector configuration

To create a global Workday Human Resource connector configuration, follow these steps:

. Click the *Global Elements tab* at the base of the canvas, then click *Create*.
. Use the filter to locate, then select, *Workday Human Resource*, then click OK.
. Configure the global connector's parameters according to the table below.
+
image::ge1.png[GE1]
+
[%header,cols="34,33,33"]
|===
a|Parameter a|Description |Example
|*Name* |Name for the global element |Workday_Human_Resource1
|*User* |User for connecting to Workday. The username should follow this structure: +
userID@tenantID |user1@mulesoft_pt1
|*Password* |Password for connecting to Workday a|----
 ********
----
|*Endpoint* a|URL where data server is hosted. It should follow this structure:

`+https://{your Workday domain}/ccx/service/\{your tenant name}/\{desired Workday Service}/\{desired Workday Service Version}+` | `+https://services1.workday.com/ccx/service/acme/Human_Resources/v1+
|*wsdl* |Workday WSDL location. This is not required for the connector to function properly. |
|===

. Access the *Pooling Profile* tab to configure any settings relevant to managing multiple connections via a connection pool.
. Access the *Reconnection* tab to configure any settings relevant to reconnection strategies that Mule should execute if it loses its connection to Workday.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that the parameters of your global Workday connector are accurate, and that Mule is able to successfully connect to your instance of Workday.
. Click *OK* to save the global connector configurations.
. Return to the *Message Flow* tab in Studio. Drag the Human Resource Connector onto the canvas, then select it to open the Properties Editor console.
. Configure the connector's parameters according to the table below.

+
image::workday1.png[Workday1]
+
[%header,cols="34,33,33"]
|===
a|
Field
a|
Description
a|
Default
|*Display Name* |The name with which the element will be displayed in your flow. |Workday Human Resource
|*Config Reference* |The global element linked to this connector. Global elements encapsulate reusable data about the connection to the DB. |
|*Operation* |The operation to perform. |Add update organization
|*Organization Find Reference* |A parameter that defines the query filter for the set of results. |#[payload]
|===

. Click blank space on the canvas to save your Workday connector configurations. +

=== Example Use Case 1:

*Note*: Get the first 100 workers in your company and create a CSV file for them.

As a recruiter, I want to get a partial list of employees in my company and export the list to a file.

=== Using the Studio Visual Editor


. Drag an HTTP Endpoint into a new flow, and configure it with the following parameters:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Property |Value
|*Host* |`localhost`
|*Path* |`getWorker`
|===
+
image::http-general.png[HTTP-general]
+
image::http-ge.png[HTTP-GE]
[TIP]
To set the host for the HTTP connector, you need to add a connector configuration. Click the plus sign (*+*) next to *Connector Configuration* (outlined above) to display the global element properties for the HTTP connector. Then, set the value of the *Host* field to `localhost`.
+
The new flow is now reachable through the path `+http://localhost:8081/getWorker+`.
+
. Add a Groovy transformer after the HTTP endpoint to deal with the message payload.
. Add the following code into the Groovy transformer. This groovy script constructs the SOAP request to get workers out of Workday.
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
// instantiate a new getworkerrequest object
com.workday.hr.GetWorkersRequestType getWorkersType = new com.workday.hr.GetWorkersRequestType();

//OPTIONAL instantiate a responsefilter object to set page number
com.workday.hr.ResponseFilterType responseFilterType = new com.workday.hr.ResponseFilterType();
//Set the page number
responseFilterType.setPage(1);
//set the response filter in the worker object
getWorkersType.setResponseFilter(responseFilterType);

//return the getworkerrequest object as the message payload
return getWorkersType;
----

. Drag a Workday Human Resource connector into the flow. +
+
image::workdayflow1.png[workdayFlow1]

. Add a new Global element by clicking on the plus sign next to the *Connector Configuration* field.
+
image::wd2.png[]

. Configure this Global Element according to the table below (Refer to <<Configuring the Workday Human Resource Connector>> for more details).
+
image::workdaygeprops.png[WorkdayGEProps]
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Property |Description
|*Name* |A unique name for this global element to be referenced by connectors
|*user* |User for connecting to Workday, formatted as <user>@<Tenant ID>
|*password* |Workday password
|*endpoint* |URL of your Workday server, in the form `+https://WORKDAY_DOMAIN/ccx/service/YOUR_TENANT_NAME/WORKDAY_SERVICE/WORKDAY_SERVICE_VERSION+`,  for example, `+https://services1.workday.com/ccx/service/acme/Human_Resources/v1+`.
|===

. Back in the properties editor of the Workday Human Resource connector in your application, configure the remaining parameters according to the table below.
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Value
|*Display Name* |Workday Human Resource
|*Config Reference* |Workday_Human_Resource (the name of the global element you created)
|*Operation* |Get workers
|*Workers Request Reference* |Leave the default #[payload]
|===
+
image::wd3.png[]

. Add a DataMapper transformer, then configure it as per the steps listed below.
.. For the input type, select *Connector*. The fields should be automatically populated with the following:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Property |Value
|*Connector* |Workday_Human_Resource
|*Operation* |get-workers
|*Object* |GetWorkersResponseType
|===
.. For the output type, select *CSV*, then *User Defined*. Click *Create/Edit Structure...* to specify the following data structure for the output file:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Variable |Type
|*UserID* |String
|*Name* |String
|*Title* |String
|===
.. Once you have defined both input and output, click *Create Mapping*.
.. In the response data provided by the connector (listed in DataMapper's Input pane) find the *worker* element, then drag it to the output root node as shown below. This will create a new *Element Mapping*.
+
image::worker-element.png[worker+element]

.. Find the input data fields of the *worker* that you want to map to your CSV output file. Drag each input data field to its corresponding output CSV field. +
+
image::dm.png[DM]

. Add a File Endpoint at the end of your flow to output the payload to a CSV file. +
  image:workdayflow1-final-stage.png[workdayFlow1-final_stage]
+
Configure the File Endpoint as shown below.
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Property |Value
|*Display Name* |`File`
|*Path* |`<desired path to create files in>`
|*Output Pattern* |`<desired filename>`
|===

. Run the project as a Mule application.
. From a browser, navigate to `+http://localhost:8081/getWorker+`.
. Mule performs the query, produces a CSV file with a list of contacts matching the query criteria, and inserts the file in the output folder you specified.

=== Using the XML Editor


. Add a *`wd-hr:config` global element* to your project, then configure its attributes and child elements according to the table below (see code below for a complete sample).
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<wd-hr:config name="Workday_Human_Resource" doc:name="Workday Human Resource" hrUser="<your user name>" hrPassword="<your password>" hrEndpoint="<your server>">
        <wd-hr:connection-pooling-profile initialisationPolicy="INITIALISE_ONE" exhaustedAction="WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW"/>
</wd-hr:config>
----
+
[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
a|
Attribute
a|
Value
|*name* a|`Workday_Human_Resource`
|*doc:name* a|`Workday Human Resource`
|*objectManager* |`EAIObjMgr_enu`
|*hrPassword* |`<your password>`
|*hrEndpoint* |`<your server>`
|*hrUser* |`<your username>`
|===
+
[%header,cols="1*"]
|===
a|
Child Element
|*wd-hr:connection-pooling-profile*
|===
+
[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
a|
Child Element Attribute
a|
Value
|*initialisationPolicy*
a|`INITIALISE_ONE`
|*exhaustedAction*
a|`WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW`
|===

. Create a Mule flow with an *HTTP endpoint*, configuring the endpoint according to the table below (see code below for a complete sample).
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="workdayFlow1"doc:name="workdayFlow1">
    <http:inbound-endpoint exchange-pattern="one-way"host="localhost"port="8081"path="getWorker"doc:name="HTTP"/>
</flow>
----
+
[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
a|
Attribute
a|
Value
|*exchange-pattern*
a|`one-way`
|*host* a|`localhost`
|*port* a|`8081`
|*path* a|`getWorker`
|*doc:name* a|`HTTP`
|===
+
The new flow is now reachable through the path `+http://localhost:8081/getWorker+`. As the exchange pattern is set to one-way, no response message is returned to the requester.

. After the HTTP endpoint, add Groovy transformer:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<scripting:transformer doc:name="Groovy">
    <scripting:script engine="Groovy">
    </scripting:script>
</scripting:transformer>
----
+
Include the following code inside the Groovy transformer:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
//This groovy script constructs the SOAP request to get workers out of workday

// instantiate a new getworkerrequest object
com.workday.hr.GetWorkersRequestType getWorkersType = new com.workday.hr.GetWorkersRequestType();

//OPTIONAL instantiate a responsefilter object to set page number
com.workday.hr.ResponseFilterType responseFilterType = new com.workday.hr.ResponseFilterType();
//Set the page number
responseFilterType.setPage(1);
//set the response filter in the worker object
getWorkersType.setResponseFilter(responseFilterType);

//return the getworkerrequest object as the message payload
return getWorkersType;
----
+
The end result should look like this:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<scripting:transformer doc:name="Groovy">
    <scripting:script engine="Groovy"><![CDATA[//This groovy script constructs the SOAP request to get workers out of workday
// instantiate a new getworkerrequest object
com.workday.hr.GetWorkersRequestType getWorkersType = new com.workday.hr.GetWorkersRequestType();
//OPTIONAL instantiate a responsefilter object to set page number
com.workday.hr.ResponseFilterType responseFilterType = new com.workday.hr.ResponseFilterType();
//Set the page number
responseFilterType.setPage(1);
//set the response filter in the worker object
getWorkersType.setResponseFilter(responseFilterType);
//return the getworkerrequest object as the message payload
return getWorkersType;

]]>
    </scripting:script>
</scripting:transformer>
----

. After the Groovy transformer, add a `wd-hr:get-workers` element to your flow, configuring the attributes according to the table below.
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Property |Value
|*doc:name* |Workday Human Resource
|*config-ref* |`Workday_Human_Resource`
|===
+
The `config-ref` links this connector to the global element you created at the beginning of this example.
. Add a DataMapper element.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<data-mapper:config name="new_mapping_grf" transformationGraphPath="new_mapping.grf" doc:name="DataMapper"/>
----
+
You must configure the DataMapper element through Studio's Visual Editor. Switch the view to Studio's Message Flow view, then click the DataMapper element to set its properties.

.. For the input type, select *Connector*. The fields should be automatically populated with the following:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Property |Value
|*Connector* |Workday_Human_Resource
|*Operation* |get-workers
|*Object* |GetWorkersResponseType
|===
.. For the output type, select *CSV*, then *User Defined*. Click *Edit Fields* to specify the following data structure for the output file.
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Variable |Type
|*UserID* |String
|*Name* |String
|*Title* |String
|===
.. Once you have defined both input and output, click *Create Mapping*
.. In the response data provided by the connector (listed in DataMapper's Input pane) find the *worker* element, then drag it to the output root node as shown below. This will create a new *Element Mapping*.
+
image::worker-element.png[worker+element]

.. Find the input data fields of the worker that you want to map to your CSV output file. Drag each input data field to its corresponding output CSV field.
+
image::dm.png[DM]

. Add a `file:outbound-endpoint` in the flow after the DataMapper to output the payload into a CSV file. Configure its attributes according to the table below.
+
[source,xml]
----
<file:outbound-endpoint path="/Users/mulesoft/AnypointStudio/workspace/workday/testfiles" responseTimeout="10000" doc:name="File"/>
----
+
[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
a|
Attribute
a|
Value
|*path* |location in which you wish to capture the CSV file the application produces
|*responseTimeout* a|`10000`
|*doc:name* a|`File`
|===

. Run the project as a Mule Application.
. From a browser, navigate to `+http://localhost:8081/getWorker+`.
. Mule conducts the query, produces a CSV file with a list workers, and inserts the file in the output folder you specified.


== Example Code

Keep in mind that for this example to work, you must manually configure the following values of the global Workday HR connector (`wd-hr:config` element):

* hrUser
* hrPassword
* hrEndpoint

Moreover, adjust the filepath configuration to match a valid path on your local system and note that the DataMapper component must be configured manually using Studio's Visual Editor.

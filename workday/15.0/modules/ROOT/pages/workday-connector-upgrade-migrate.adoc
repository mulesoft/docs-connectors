== What's Changed

=== 15.x

* Upgraded the Workday API to 37.0.
* Added the *Drive*, *Metadata Translations*, and *Org Studio* operations.

== Upgrade Prerequisites

Before you upgrade Workday Connector from version 14.x to version 15.x, you must:

. Create a backup of your files, data, and configuration in case you need to restore the connector to the previous version.
. Install Workday Connector 15.x to replace the Workday operations that were previously included in Workday Connector 14.x.

== Upgrade Steps

Follow these steps to perform the upgrade from Workday Connector 14.x to Workday Connector 15.x:

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *Search in Exchange*.
. In the *Add Dependencies to Project* window, enter `workday` in the search field.
. In the *Available modules* section, select *Workday Connector - Mule 4* and click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.
. Verify that the `workday-connector` dependency version is `15.0.0` in the `pom.xml` file.

Studio upgrades the connector automatically.

== Verify the Upgrade

After you install the latest version of the connector, follow these steps to verify the upgrade:

. In Studio, verify that there are no errors in the *Problems* or *Console* views.
. Check the project `pom.xml` file and verify that there are no problems.
. Test the connection and verify that the operations work.

== Troubleshooting

If there are problems with caching the parameters and caching the metadata, try restarting Studio.

== Revert the Upgrade

If you must revert to the previous version of Workday Connector, change the `workday-connector` dependency version `15.x.x` in the project's `pom.xml` file to the previous version.

You must update the project's `pom.xml` file in Studio.

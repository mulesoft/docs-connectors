Workday Connector v6.0

The Anypoint Connector for Workday is a closed source Enterprise connector which provides a connection between Workday and third party software. It implements the Workday v24.0 API modules, and interfaces with the Human Capital Management, Financial Management, Student, and System web services. The Workday connector is a SOAP based connector developed with DevKit 3.7.0. MuleSoft maintains this connector under the xref:3.9@mule-runtime::anypoint-connectors.adoc#connector-categories[_Select_] support policy.

*Exchange:* https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/org.mule.modules/workday-connector/[Workday Connector] +
*Migration Guide:* xref:workday-connector-6.0-migration-guide.adoc[Workday Connector 6.0 Migration Guide]

== Before You Begin

To use this connector, you need:

* A Workday instance with the necessary permissions
* A set of valid credential, including username, password, tenant name, and host name (optional). The service endpoints are automatically generated based on the credentials.
* A MuleSoft Enterprise License

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule,
xref:3.9@mule-runtime::anypoint-connectors.adoc[Anypoint Connectors], and
xref:6.x@studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio Essentials]. To increase your familiarity with Studio, consider completing one or more xref:6.x@studio::basic-studio-tutorial.adoc[Basic Studio Tutorial]. This page assumes you understand xref:3.9@mule-runtime::mule-concepts.adoc[Mule Concepts], xref:3.9@mule-runtime::elements-in-a-mule-flow.adoc[Elements in a Mule Flow], and xref:3.9@mule-runtime::global-elements.adoc[Global Elements].

This document describes implementation examples within the context of Anypoint Studio, Mule ESBâ€™s graphical user interface, and, also includes configuration details for doing the same in the XML Editor.

== Compatibility

The Workday connector 6.0 is compatible with:

[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Application/Service|Version
|Mule Runtime|EE 3.7.0 or later
|Anypoint Studio|5.2 or later
|Workday API|v24.0
|Java|JDK 7
|===

== To Install this Connector

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio taskbar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange.
. Search for the connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

When Studio has an update, a message displays in the lower right corner, which you can click to install the update.

To use the Workday connector 6.0 in a production environment, you must have an Enterprise license to use Mule.  Contact the mailto:info@mulesoft.com[MuleSoft Sales Team] to obtain either of these. Read more about xref:3.9@mule-runtime::installing-an-enterprise-license.adoc[Installing an Enterprise License].

=== Upgrading from an Older Version

. Uninstall the previous Workday Connectors.
. Install the Workday Connector as described in the previous section.
. Make sure updated the Maven dependencies correctly:
+
[%header,cols="34a,33a,33a"]
|===
|Connector Version |From |To
|Version until 4.0.1 |<groupId>org.mule.modules</groupId> +
<artifactId>mule-module-workday</artifactId> |<groupId>org.mule.modules</groupId> +
<artifactId>workday-connector</artifactId>
|Versions 4.0.1 to 6.0 |<groupId>org.mule.modules</groupId> +
<artifactId>mule-module-workday-<wd_module_name></artifactId> |<groupId>org.mule.modules</groupId> +
<artifactId>workday-connector</artifactId>
|===
+
. It's important to update the flows to: +
.. Update the existing data mappings
.. Replace the Workday connector with the newer connector
.. Replace the phased out or deprecated operations
. Make the following changes to the namespace:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===

|*Namespace:* +
 xmlns:wd-staffing="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/wd-staffing" +

|===

== Creating a New Project

To use the Workday connector 6.0 in a Mule application project:

. In Studio, select *File* > *New* > *Mule Project*.
. Enter a name for your new project and leave the remaining options with their default values.
. If you plan to use Git, select *Create a .gitignore file* for the project with default ignores for Studio Projects, and then click *Next*.
. Click *Finish* to create the project.

== Configuring the Global Element

To use the Workday connector in your Mule application, you must configure a global Workday element that can be used by all the Workday connectors in the application (read more about  xref:3.9@mule-runtime::global-elements.adoc[Global Elements].) The Workday connector now offers two global configuration types:

* *Configuration*: This configuration requires the following credentials: *Username* (without the tenant name), *Password*, *Tenant Name*, and *Host Name*. Starting from version 6.0 of the connector, the service endpoints are automatically generated by the connector.
* *Configuration Advanced*: Apart from what is available in the above configuration, the advanced configuration supports a user defined HTTP Request Configuration which enables the user to adjust both the *Connection Idle Timeout* and *Response Timeout* and set up a proxy connection.

[discrete.view]
=== Studio Visual Editor

. Click the *Global Elements* tab at the base of the canvas.
. On the Global Mule Configuration Elements screen, click *Create*.
. In the Choose Global Type wizard, expand *Connector Configuration,* and then select *Workday Connector: configuration* or  *Workday Connector: configuration (advanced)*, depending on your Workday implementation.
. Click  *OK*
. Enter the global element properties.
.. For *Workday Connector: Configuration*:
+
image::wd6-global-elements.png[wd6_global_elements]
+
[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|*Name* |Enter a name of the configuration to reference it later
|*Username* |Enter the username to log in to Workday.
|*Password* |Enter the corresponding password.
|*Tenant Name* |Enter the Workday Tenant ID. It is usually appended with pt_1, such as acme_pt1.
|*Host Name* |Enter the host name of one of the Workday Cloud Servers. By default, the connector sets the host name to `impl-cc.workday.com`.
|===
+
[NOTE]
====
In the image above, the placeholder values refer to a configuration file placed in the `src` folder of your project (learn about xref:3.9@mule-runtime::configuring-properties.adoc[Configuring Properties].) You can either enter your credentials into the global configuration properties, or reference a configuration file that contains these values.

For simpler maintenance and better re-usability of your project, Mule recommends that you use a configuration file. Keeping these values in a separate file is useful if you need to deploy to different environments, such as production, development, and QA, where your access credentials differ. See xref:3.9@mule-runtime::deploying-to-multiple-environments.adoc[Deploying to Multiple Environments] for instructions on how to manage this.

[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|*Name* |Enter a name of the configuration to reference it later
|*Requestor Config* |Enter an HTTPRequestor configuration.
|*Username* |Enter the username to log in to Workday.
|*Password* |Enter the corresponding password.
|*Tenant Name* |Enter the Workday Tenant ID. It is usually appended with pt_1, such as acme_pt1.
|*Host Name* |Enter the host name of one of the Workday Cloud Servers. By default, the connector sets the host name to `impl-cc.workday.com`.
|===
. Keep the *Pooling Profile* and the *Reconnection* tabs with their default entries.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that the parameters of your global Workday connector are accurate, and that Mule is able to successfully connect to your Workday instance.
. Click *OK* to save the global connector configurations.

To configure the Workday global element:

. Ensure you have included the following namespace in your configuration file:
+
----
xmlns:wd-connector="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/wd-connector"
----
. Create a global Workday configuration outside and above your flows, using the following global configuration code:
+
[source,xml]
----
<wd-connector:config name="Workday_Connector__Configuration" username="${workday.username}" password="${workday.password}" tenantName="${workday.tenantname}" doc:name="Workday Connector: Configuration"/>

The Workday connector 6.0 is an operation-based connector, which means that when you add the connector to your flow, you need to select a Workday module and an operation for the connector to perform. The Workday connector 6.0 supports the following Workday APIs: Human Resource, Financials, Student, and System.

=== Adding the Workday Connector 6.0 to a Flow

. Create a new Mule project in Anypoint Studio.
. Drag the Workday Connector 6.0 onto the canvas, then select it to open the properties editor.
. Configure the connector's parameters:
+

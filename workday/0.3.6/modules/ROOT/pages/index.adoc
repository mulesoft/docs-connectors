_Select_

The Anypoint Connector for Workday is a closed source Enterprise connector which provides a connection between Workday and third party software. It interfaces with the Human Capital Management, Financial Management, Student, and System web services.

*Release Notes*: xref:release-notes::connector/workday-connector-release-notes.adoc#version-5-0-july-1-2015[Workday Connector Release Notes]

*Reference:* http://mulesoft.github.io/workday-connector[Workday Connector]

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Workday API. To use the this connector, you need:

* A Workday instance with requisite permission
* A set of valid credentials, including the required Workday endpoints, pointing to your Workday instance.

This document also assumes that you are familiar with Mule, xref:3.6@mule-runtime::anypoint-connectors.adoc[Anypoint Connectors], and the xref:6@studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio interface]. To increase your familiarity with Studio, consider completing one or more Anypoint Studio Tutorials. Further, this page assumes that you have a basic understanding of xref:3.6@mule-runtime::elements-in-a-mule-flow.adoc[Mule flows] and xref:3.6@mule-runtime::global-elements.adoc[Mule Global Elements]. This document describes implementation examples within the context of the Anypoint Studio Visual Editor and includes configuration details for doing the same in the XML Editor.

== Compatibility

The Workday connector 5.0 is compatible with:

[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Application/Service |Version
|Workday API |v24.0
|Mule Runtime |Enterprise Edition 3.5.0 and later
|Java |JDK 7
|===

== Installing and Configuring

=== Installing

You can install a connector in Anypoint Studio using the instructions in xref:3.6@mule-runtime::installing-connectors.adoc[To Install a Connector from Anypoint Exchange]. However, to use the Workday Connector in a production environment, you must have either:

* An *Enterprise license* to use Mule
* A *CloudHub* Starter, Professional, or Enterprise account

Contact the MuleSoft Sales Team to obtain either of these.

Click *Restart Now* to complete the installation. After you install the connector and restart Studio, you can see several new message processors available in the palette, all under the Connectors category.

image::wd-palette.png[wd_palette]

Alternatively you can also xref:5@studio::installing-extensions.adoc[install this extension via Maven].

=== Updating from an Older Version

When a new version of a connector is released, Anypoint studio displays a popup in the bottom right corner of your screen with the following message: *Updates Available*.

To upgrade to the newer version of the Workday connector:

.  Click the popup and check for the available updates.
.  Install the individual Workday connectors from the update site.
. Ensure that the maven dependencies have been updated correctly from `mule-module-workday` to `mule-module-workday-<wd_module_name>`.
+
NOTE: Make sure you update flows that are using Phased Out or Deprecated operations.
+
. Follow the instructions provided by the user interface.
. Restart Studio when prompted.

After restarting, if you have several versions of the connector installed, Mule asks you for the version of the connector you like to use.

=== Creating a New Project

. In Studio, click File > New > Mule Project.
. Enter a name for your new project and leave the remaining options with their default values.
. If you plan to use Git, select *Create a .gitignore file* for the project with default ignores for Studio Projects, and then click *Next*.
. Click *Finish* to create the project.

== Configuring the Workday Connector Global Element

To use the Workday connector in your Mule application, you must configure a global element for each Workday connector module in the application (read more about xref:3.6@mule-runtime::global-elements.adoc[global elements]). To create a global Workday connector configuration, follow these steps:

. Click the *Global Elements tab* at the base of the canvas, then click *Create*.
. Use the filter to locate, then select, one of the Workday connector configurations, then click *OK*. The example below uses the Workday Cash Management message processor.
. Configure the global connector's parameters according to the table below.
+
image::global-elements-1.jpg[global_elements_1]
+
[%header,cols="3*a"]
|===
|Parameter |Description |Example
|*Name* |Name for the global element |Workday_Cash_Management_Connection_Management
|*Username* |User for connecting to Workday. The username should follow this structure:
userID@tenantID |user1@acme_pt1
|*Password* |Password for connecting to Workday |`********`
|*Endpoint* |URL where data server is hosted. It should follow this structure:
 `+https://{workday_doman}/ccx/service/{tenent_name}/{workday_service}/{workday_service_version}+` |
+https://services1.workday.com/ccx/service/acme_pt1/Human_Resources/v24.0+
|*wsdl* |Enter the *WSDL Location* property. This defaults to the WSDL found on the Workday Community website. |
|===
+
. Access the *Pooling Profile* tab to configure any settings relevant to managing multiple connections via a connection pool.
. Access the *Reconnection* tab to configure any settings relevant to reconnection strategies that Mule should execute if it loses its connection to Workday.
+
[NOTE]
The Workday connector v5.0 enables you to adjust the values for the *Connection Timeout* and the *Receive Timeout* of requests that are sent to Workday. The default value for both of these fields is 60000ms, which means that any requests that take longer than a minute throw an exception. You can override this behavior by setting their values to 0 so that the connector waits indefinitely until a request is successfully sent and a response is received.
+
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that the parameters of your global Workday connector are accurate, and that Mule is able to successfully connect to your instance of Workday. (Read more about xref:3.6@mule-runtime::testing-connections.adoc[Testing Connections].)
. Click *OK* to save the global connector configurations.

=== Setting up a Global Configuration with Proxy (Optional)

The Workday connector 5.0 supports the use of HTTP proxy servers. To setup the Global Configuration with Proxy:

. Click the *Global Elements tab* at the base of the canvas, then click *Create*.
. Use the filter to locate, then select, one of the Workday connector configurations, then click *OK*. The example below uses the Workday Cash Management message processor.
. Configure the global connector's parameters.
+
image::global-elements-2.jpg[global_elements_2]
+
. Under the Proxy Settings section, enter the *Host* address and *Port* number. If one of these fields is an input, the other must also be input.
. If your proxy server requires you to specify a username and password, you can fill these in the Username and Password fields. However, if your proxy server does not require a username and password, you can leave these fields empty.

== Using the Connector

The Workday connector is an operation-based connector, which means that when you add the connector to your flow, you need to configure a specific operation the connector is intended to perform.

=== Adding the Workday Connector to a Flow

. Create a new Mule project in Anypoint Studio.
. Drag the relevant Workday message processor onto the canvas, then select it to open the properties editor. We use the Workday Cash Management connector for an example here.
. Configure the connector's parameters:
+
image::cash-management.png[cash_management]
+
[%header,cols="3*"]
|===
|Field |Description |Default
|*Display Name* |The name of the element in your flow. |Workday Cash Management
|*Config Reference* |The global element linked to this connector. |
|*Operation* |The operation to perform. |Get financial institutions
|*Get Financial Request Reference* |A parameter that defines the query filter for the set of results. |#[payload]
|===
+
. Click blank space on the canvas to save your Workday connector configurations.

== Use Case - Studio Visual Editor

Get the first 100 workers in your company and create a CSV file for them. As a recruiter, I want to get a partial list of employees in my company and export the list to a file.

. Drag an HTTP connector into a new flow, and configure it with the following parameters:
+
[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Property |Value
|*Host* |`localhost`
|*Path* |`getWorker`
|===
+
image::http-general.png[HTTP-general]
+
image::http-ge.png[HTTP-GE]
+
[TIP]
====
To set the host for the HTTP connector, you need to add a connector configuration. Click the plus *+* icon next to *Connector Configuration* (outlined above) to display the global element properties for the HTTP connector. Then, set the value of the *Host* field to `localhost`.
The new flow is now reachable through the path `http://localhost:8081/getWorker`.
====
+
. Add a Groovy transformer after the HTTP connector to deal with the message payload.
. Add the following code into the Groovy transformer. This Groovy script constructs the SOAP request to get workers out of Workday.
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
// instantiate a new getworkerrequest object
com.workday.hr.GetWorkersRequestType getWorkersType = new com.workday.hr.GetWorkersRequestType();

//OPTIONAL instantiate a responsefilter object to set page number
com.workday.hr.ResponseFilterType responseFilterType = new com.workday.hr.ResponseFilterType();
//Set the page number
responseFilterType.setPage(1);
//set the response filter in the worker object
getWorkersType.setResponseFilter(responseFilterType);

//return the getworkerrequest object as the message payload
return getWorkersType;
----
+
. Drag a Workday Human Resource connector into the flow.
+
image::workdayflow1.png[workdayFlow1]
+
. Add a new Global element by clicking on the plus sign next to the *Connector Configuration* field.
+
image::wd2.png[]
+
. Configure this Global Element according to the table below (Refer to Configuring the Workday Human Resource Connector for more details).
+
image::global-elements-1.jpg[global_elements_1]
+
[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Property |Description
|*Name* |A unique name for this global element to be referenced by connectors
|*user* |User for connecting to Workday, formatted as <user>@<Tenant ID>
|*password* |Workday password
|*endpoint* |URL of your Workday server, in the form https://<workday_domain>/ccx/service/<tenent_name>/<workday_service>/<workday_service_version>+ (for example, `+https://services1.workday.com/ccx/service/acme/Human_Resources/v1+`).
|===
+
. Back in the properties editor of the Workday Human Resource connector in your application, configure the remaining parameters according to the table below.
+
[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Field |Value
|*Display Name* |Workday Human Resource
|*Config Reference* |Workday_Human_Resource (the name of the global element you created)
|*Operation* |Get workers
|*Workers Request Reference* |Leave the default #[payload]
|===
+
image::wd3.png[]
+
. Add a DataMapper transformer, then configure it as per the steps listed below.
.. For the input type, select *Connector*. The fields should be automatically populated with the following:
+
[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Property |Value
|*Connector* |Workday_Human_Resource
|*Operation* |get-workers
|*Object* |GetWorkersResponseType
|===
+
.. For the output type, select *CSV*, then *User Defined*. Click *Create/Edit Structure* to specify the following data structure for the output file:
+
[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Variable |Type
|*UserID* |String
|*Name* |String
|*Title* |String
|===
+
.. Once you have defined both input and output, click *Create Mapping*.
.. In the response data provided by the connector (listed in DataMapper's Input pane) find the *worker* element, then drag it to the output root node as shown below. This creates a new *Element Mapping*.
+
image::worker-element.png[]
+
.. Find the input data fields of the *worker* that you want to map to your CSV output file. Drag each input data field to its corresponding output CSV field.
+
image::dm.png[DM]
+
. Add a File Endpoint at the end of your flow to output the payload to a CSV file.
+
image::workdayflow1-final-stage.png[workdayFlow1-final_stage]
+
Configure the File Endpoint:
+
[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Property |Value
|*Display Name* |`File`
|*Path* |`<desired path to create files in>`
|*Output Pattern* |`<desired filename>`
|===
+
. Run the project as a Mule application.
. From a browser, navigate to `http://localhost:8081/getWorker`.
. Mule performs the query, produces a CSV file with a list of contacts matching the query criteria, and inserts the file in the output folder you specified.

== Use Case - XML Editor

Get the first 100 workers in your company and create a CSV file for them. As a recruiter, I want to get a partial list of employees in my company and export the list to a file.

. Add a *`wd-hr:config` global element* to your project, then configure its attributes and child elements according to the table below (see code below for a complete sample).
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<wd-hr:config name="Workday_Human_Resource" doc:name="Workday Human Resource" hrUser="<your user name>" hrPassword="<your password>" hrEndpoint="<your server>">
        <wd-hr:connection-pooling-profile initialisationPolicy="INITIALISE_ONE" exhaustedAction="WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW"/>
</wd-hr:config>
----
+
[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*name* |`Workday_Human_Resource`
|*doc:name* |`Workday Human Resource`
|*objectManager* |`EAIObjMgr_enu`
|*hrPassword* |`<your password>`
|*hrEndpoint* |`<your server>`
|*hrUser* |`<your username>`
|===
+
[%header,cols="1*a"]
|===
|
Child Element
|*wd-hr:connection-pooling-profile*
|===
+
[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Child Element Attribute |Value
|*initialisationPolicy* |`INITIALISE_ONE`
|*exhaustedAction* |`WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW`
|===
+
. Create a Mule flow with an *HTTP connector*, configuring according to the table below (see code below for a complete sample).
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="workdayFlow1"doc:name="workdayFlow1">
    <http:inbound-endpoint exchange-pattern="one-way"host="localhost"port="8081"path="getWorker"doc:name="HTTP"/>
</flow>
----
+
[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*exchange-pattern* |`one-way`
|*host* |`localhost`
|*port* |`8081`
|*path* |`getWorker`
|*doc:name* |`HTTP`
|===
+
The new flow is now reachable through the path `+http://localhost:8081/getWorker+`. As the exchange pattern is set to one-way, no response message is returned to the requester.
+
. After the HTTP connector, add Groovy transformer:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<scripting:transformer doc:name="Groovy">
    <scripting:script engine="Groovy">
    </scripting:script>
</scripting:transformer>
----
+
Include the following code inside the Groovy transformer:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
//This groovy script constructs the SOAP request to get workers out of workday

// instantiate a new getworkerrequest object
com.workday.hr.GetWorkersRequestType getWorkersType = new com.workday.hr.GetWorkersRequestType();

//OPTIONAL instantiate a responsefilter object to set page number
com.workday.hr.ResponseFilterType responseFilterType = new com.workday.hr.ResponseFilterType();
//Set the page number
responseFilterType.setPage(1);
//set the response filter in the worker object
getWorkersType.setResponseFilter(responseFilterType);

//return the getworkerrequest object as the message payload
return getWorkersType;
----
+
The end result should look like this:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<scripting:transformer doc:name="Groovy">
    <scripting:script engine="Groovy"><![CDATA[//This groovy script constructs the SOAP request to get workers out of workday
// instantiate a new getworkerrequest object
com.workday.hr.GetWorkersRequestType getWorkersType = new com.workday.hr.GetWorkersRequestType();
//OPTIONAL instantiate a responsefilter object to set page number
com.workday.hr.ResponseFilterType responseFilterType = new com.workday.hr.ResponseFilterType();
//Set the page number
responseFilterType.setPage(1);
//set the response filter in the worker object
getWorkersType.setResponseFilter(responseFilterType);
//return the getworkerrequest object as the message payload
return getWorkersType;

]]>
    </scripting:script>
</scripting:transformer>
----
+
. After the Groovy transformer, add a *`wd-hr:get-workers`* element to your flow, configuring the attributes according to the table below.
+
[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Property |Value
|*doc:name* |Workday Human Resource
|*config-ref* |`Workday_Human_Resource`
|===
+
The `config-ref` links this connector to the global element you created at the beginning of this example.
+
. Add a DataMapper element.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<data-mapper:config name="new_mapping_grf" transformationGraphPath="new_mapping.grf" doc:name="DataMapper"/>
----
+
You must configure the DataMapper element through Studio's Visual Editor. Switch the view to Studio's Message Flow view, then click the DataMapper element to set its properties.
+
.. For the input type, select *Connector*. The fields should be automatically populated with the following:
+
[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Property |Value
|*Connector* |Workday_Human_Resource
|*Operation* |get-workers
|*Object* |GetWorkersResponseType
|===
+
.. For the output type, select *CSV*, then *User Defined*. Click *Edit Fields* to specify the following data structure for the output file.
+
[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Variable |Type
|*UserID* |String
|*Name* |String
|*Title* |String
|===
+
.. Once you have defined both input and output, click *Create Mapping*
.. In the response data provided by the connector (listed in DataMapper's Input pane) find the *worker* element, then drag it to the output root node as shown below. This creates a new *Element Mapping*.
+
image::worker-element.png[]
+
.. Find the input data fields of the worker that you want to map to your CSV output file. Drag each input data field to its corresponding output CSV field.
+
image::dm.png[DM]
+
. Add a `file:outbound-endpoint` in the flow after the DataMapper to output the payload into a CSV file. Configure its attributes as follows:
+
`<file:outbound-endpoint path="/Users/mulesoft/AnypointStudio/workspace/workday/testfiles" responseTimeout="10000" doc:name="File"/>`
+
[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*path* |The location in which you wish to capture the CSV file the application produces
|*responseTimeout* |

----
10000
----

|*doc:name* |

----
File
----

|===
+
. Run the project as a Mule Application.
. From a browser, navigate to `http://localhost:8081/getWorker`.
. Mule conducts the query, produces a CSV file with a list workers, and inserts the file in the output folder you specified.



== Example Code

For this example to work, you must manually configure the following values of the global Workday HR connector (`wd-hr:config` element):

* hrUser
* hrPassword
* hrEndpoint

Moreover, adjust the filepath configuration to match a valid path on your local system and note that the DataMapper component must be configured manually using Studio's Visual Editor.

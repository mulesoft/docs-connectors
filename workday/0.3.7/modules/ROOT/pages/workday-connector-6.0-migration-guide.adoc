:page-aliases: 3.7@mule-runtime::workday-connector-6.0-migration-guide.adoc

The Workday connector version 6.0 is developed to:

* Combine Workday APIs into one connector.  For more information about the supported API see the xref:release-notes::connector/workday-connector-release-notes.adoc#6-0[Workday 6.0 Connector Release Notes].
* Be lightweight by creating requests in XML format

The Workday connector v6.0 is a completely revamped connector, and is not compatible with any of the older versions of the connector.

== Workday Version 6.0 Versus Previous Versions

[%header,cols="34a,33a,33a"]
|===
|  |Workday Connector 6.0 |Previous versions
|*Global Configuration*
|The Workday connector now offers two global configuration types:

* *Configuration*: This configuration requires the following credentials: username (without the tenant name), password, tenant name, and host name. Starting from version 6.0, the service endpoints are automatically generated by the connector.
* *Configuration Advanced*: Apart from what is available in the above configuration, the advanced configuration supports a user defined HTTP Request Configuration which enables the user to adjust both the *Connection Idle Timeout* and *Response Timeout* and setup a proxy connection.

 |In the previous version of the connector, a global configuration for each of the Workday API was defined, where the user would input his username together with the tenant name, password, service endpoint, and default WSDL location.
|*Connector Component - Basic Settings Panel* |The connector component lists only one operation called _Invoke_ in the _Operation_ list. |The previous version requires the user to select one of the available Workday web operations.
|*Connector Component - General Panel* a|
The General Panel consists two drop-down lists:

* *Service* - Contains a list of Workday APIs. The user must select one of the available Workday APIs, such as Staffing.
* *Operation* - It is populated according to the selected API. The user must select the Workday web operation to invoke, and the connector automatically generates the required meta data.

|Supports only one text-box that requires the user to specify the request reference. By default, this option was set to bring the request reference from the payload.
|*Payload Manipulation* |Use of Data Weave is encouraged to manipulate the payload for input and to process the response. The connector picks the input request from the flow payload, and it only accepts payloads of XML type. |Previous versions of the connector enable the user to create request using the DataMapper, the Java Component, or the Groovy Component.

. After the installation is complete, restart Anypoint Studio.

== Post Installation

The following sections describe how to complete an installation from either Maven or non-Maven projects.

=== Maven Based Project

. Open the project's pom.xml file and delete any references to the older version.  The artifact-id of the previous versions follow the following format `mule-module-workday-<api-name>`
. Add the Workday connector reference by setting the artifact-id to `workday-connector` and set the version property to `6.0.0`
. Save your pom.xml file changes.

The user may need to manually update the project dependencies.

=== Non-Maven Based Project

* Locate the Workday connector library, right-click the library, and click *Build Path* > *Remove from Build Path*.
* To import the Workday connector v6.0 library, right-click the project, click *Build Path* > *Add Libraries* > *Anypoint Connectors Dependencies*, and locate *Workday Connector v6.0.0*.

After following the steps above, update your flows by replacing the Workday Connector with the newer version and their data mappings.

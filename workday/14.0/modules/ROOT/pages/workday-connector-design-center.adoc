= Use Flow Designer to Configure Workday Connector 14.0 - Mule 4

Anypoint Design Center's Flow Designer enables you to create apps visually. To use Flow Designer, work with your Anypoint Platform administrator to ensure that you have a xref:access-management::environments.adoc#to-create-a-new-environment[Design environment]. For more information, see the xref:design-center::fd-tour.adoc[Flow Designer Tour].

To create an app in Flow Designer:

* Configure the trigger (source) for your app.
* Configure the target component for your app.

For information about connector field values, see
the xref:workday-reference.adoc[Workday Connector Reference].

== Configure the Trigger

Workday Connector provides the *On Modified Objects* trigger, which starts your app when an object is created, modified, or deleted in Workday. Alternatively, you can use:

* *HTTP Listener* to start your app from a browser
or with a command such as `curl`.
* *Scheduler* to start your app on a timed schedule

To configure the trigger:

. In Design Center, click *Create new*.
. Click *Create new application*.
. Specify a value for *Project name*, and click *Create*.
. Click *Go straight to canvas* to exit from *Let's get started*.
. In the middle of the canvas, click the empty trigger card to expand it.
. Configure the trigger for the connector.
+
To use the *On Modified Objects* trigger, enter `workday` in the search field and select *Workday Connector*.
. Click *Add Connection*.
. In the *Connection Name field*, enter a name for the connection.
. In the *Connection Type* field, select whether to use Basic authentication or x.509 Authentication.
. Complete the required fields.
. Click *Test* to test the connection.
. Click *Save*.

== Configure the Target Component

The target component enables your app to process data received from the trigger. Workday Connector provides operations that you can use to perform tasks for educational organizations, human resources, professional services,
payroll, and benefits administration.

To configure the target component:

. In the *Object Type* field, select the Workday object type.
. Click outside of the dialog.
. Click *+* next to the trigger card.
. In *Select a component*, search for `workday` and select *Workday Connector*.
. Select an operation.
. Click *Edit*.
. Click *Add Connection*.
. In the *Connection Name* field, select the configured connection.
. Complete the required fields.

= Salesforce CDP - Additional Configuration Information - Mule 4

Configure Anypoint Connector for Salesforce CDP Connector to generate an OAuth 2.0 keystore file.

[[generate-keystore]]
== Generate a Keystore File

Salesforce CDP Connector uses the Bouncy Castle cryptographic library to load the certificate from the keystore and sign the payload for the authentication requests.

The library has a https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-5382[vulnerability (CVE-2018-5382)] that relates to the BKS-V1 keystore file type. By default, Salesforce CDP Connector uses JKS or PKCS12 keystores. Avoid using BKS-V1 keystore files, as documented in the https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/306792[Bouncy Castle proposed solution].

To generate a JKS keystore file:

. Go to your Mule workspace and open the command prompt (for Windows) or Terminal (for Mac).
. Enter this command:
+
[source]
----
keytool -genkeypair -alias salesforce-cert -keyalg RSA -keystore salesforce-cert.jks
----
+
. Enter the following information:
+
** Password for the keystore
** Your first name and last name
** Your organization unit
** Your city and state, and the two-letter code for your country
+
The system generates a Java keystore file (JKS format) that contains a private or public key pair in your workspace.
+
. Provide the file path for the keystore in your connector configuration.
+
Enter this command:
+
[source]
----
keytool -exportcert -alias salesforce-cert -file salesforce-cert.crt -keystore salesforce-cert.jks
----
+
The system exports the public key from the keystore into the workspace. This is the public key to enter in your Salesforce instance.
+
. Verify that you have both the keystore (`salesforce-cert.jks`) and the public key (`salesforce-cert.crt`) files in your workspace.

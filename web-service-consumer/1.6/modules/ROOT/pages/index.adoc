Support Category: https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#anypoint-connectors[Select]

Anypoint Connector for Web Service Consumer (Web Service Consumer Connector) consumes a SOAP web service from a Mule app, to acquire data from an external source. In many cases, you can use Anypoint Connector for Workday (Workday Connector) or Anypoint Connector for ServiceNow (ServiceNow Connector) to connect to a service provider, however; when no connector is available for a specific web service, the easiest way to consume the service is to use the Web Service Consumer Connector.

The main features of the connector include:

* Consume DOC literal web services
* Use SOAP multipart messages
* Use SOAP headers
* Support DataSense for SOAP headers, SOAP body, and attachments
* Use embedded DataWeave transformations inside the operation
* Support an unified experience for SOAP with attachments and MTOM handling
* Custom HTTP configuration as a transport
* Support Web Service Security (WS Security)

[NOTE]
Web Service Consumer Connector doesn't support RPC WSDLs.

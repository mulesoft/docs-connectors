= Troubleshooting OAuth Module - Mule 4

To troubleshoot OAuth module, become familiar with the information about enabling verbose logging and interpreting commonly throw messages.

== Enable Verbose Logging

To get a better understanding of why an application's interaction with OAuth module is failing, temporarily enable verbose logging for the module.

Remember to always disable the enhanced verbosity after troubleshooting, because it affects your Mule application performance.

To enable verbose logging in the configuration file:

. Access Anypoint Studio and navigate to the *Package Explorer* view.
. Open your application's project name.
. Open the `src/main/resources` folder.
. Open the `log4j2.xml` file inside the folder.
. Add an `<AsyncLogger>` tag inside the `<Loggers>` tag:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
			<Loggers>
				...
				<AsyncLogger name="org.mule.extension.oauth2" level="DEBUG"/>
				...
			</Loggers>
----
[start=6]
. Save your application changes.
. Click the project name in *Package Explorer* and then click *Run* > *Run As* > *Mule Application*.

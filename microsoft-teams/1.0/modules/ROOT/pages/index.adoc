Support Category: https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#anypoint-connectors[Select]

Anypoint Connector for Microsoft Teams (Microsoft Teams Connector) gives you access to the Microsoft Teams APIs. This connector exposes the most commonly used operations provided by the Microsoft Teams APIs. 

For compatibility information and fixed issues, see the Microsoft Teams Connector Release Notes.

== Prerequisites

To use this connector, you must be familiar with:

* The Microsoft Teams APIs
* Anypoint Connectors
* Mule runtime engine (Mule)
* Elements and global elements in a Mule flow
* Creating a Mule app using Anypoint Studio (Studio)

Before creating an app, you must have:

* Credentials to access the target resource
* Anypoint Studio version 7.3.5 or later

== Common Use Cases for the Connector

* Send notifications
+
Users are notified in Microsoft Teams when a new resource is created or modified in another service, for example, when a new Salesforce case is created.
* Onboard employees
+
When a group of people are hired at the same time, and human resources has an email in Gmail or a spreadsheet in Google Sheets that contains information about the new hires, HR can use the email or spreadsheet to trigger different actions:
+
** Add users to a workspace
** Create a channel for all new hires and use it to instantly share important onboarding information with them
** Archive the new hire channel after onboarding is completed
+
After the onboarding process is completed, resources can be freed or reused for the next onboarding process.
* Create new teams for business projects
+
Create teams for new business projects to streamline and automate the management of team members, for example:
+
** After a new team is created for a new business project, the client can quickly and automatically integrate this new team by using Microsoft Teams.
** After teams are created, a new employee is hired and the client can automatically execute a series of actions to integrate the new hire with Microsoft Teams.
** When a team member is either removed or moved to another team, the client can execute a series of automated steps to reflect this change within Microsoft Teams.
** When the business project ends, the resources allocated for that business project in Microsoft Teams can be reused or removed.
** A manager is hired or replaced, so the corresponding group owner of the team must be changed.


== Authentication Types

Microsoft Teams Connector connections use the following OAuth 2.0 grant types:

* OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant type, which uses an access token from the Microsoft identity platform for authentication
* OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant type, which uses the identity of the application to access web-hosted resources

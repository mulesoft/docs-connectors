The Anypoint Connector for Microsoft Dynamics Customer Relationship Management (CRM)  enables you to access Microsoft Dynamics CRM’s SOAP Organization Service. You can add this connector to an Anypoint Studio flow.

*Release Notes*: xref:release-notes::connector/microsoft-dynamics-crm-connector-release-notes.adoc[Microsoft Dynamics CRM Connector Release Notes]

== Overview

This connector lets you perform the following operations:

* Create, update, and delete records
* Retrieve a single record or query multiple records
* Associate and disassociate records
* Execute a request message

This connector supports these Microsoft Dynamics CRM versions:

* Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 (on-premise)
* Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013 (on-premise)
* Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online

Configuring the connector requires minimal parameters except for advanced use:

* Username and password for users granted access to CRM
* Organization Service URL - usually in the format: +https://crm.mycompany.com/MyOrganization/XRMServices/2011/Organization.svc+

{"name":"Adventure Works (sample)","accountnumber":"ABC28UU7","accountid":"eba917b4-7e06-e411-82a5-6c3be5a8ad64"}]
----


== CRM Authentication

=== Authentication Schemes

The Microsoft Dynamics CRM connector supports different authentication schemes based on the Microsoft Dynamics CRM that is accessed.

Supported authentication schemes for Microsoft Dynamics CRM on premise:

* Windows Authentication - Kerberos
* Windows Authentication – NTLM (requires Anypoint Gateway for Windows)
* Claims-based Authentication

Supported authentication schemes for Microsoft Dynamics CRM online:

* Live ID

Unsupported authentication schemes:

* Office 365 (not supported)

=== Advanced Kerberos Authentication

The preferred method of configuring the connector for Kerberos authentication is to leverage auto-configuration. The prerequisites for automatically detecting Kerberos configuration settings to work are:

* Mule ESB server joined to the same domain as the CRM instance
* AD Domain Controller is accessible from the Mule ESB server

In case the Kerberos configuration settings cannot be automatically detected, you can set the following parameters manually:

* *SPN*: The Service Principal Name can usually be automatically discovered from the Organization Service’s WSDL. If the SPN cannot be discovered automatically, the value has to be set in the connector’s connection configuration property SPN. The SPN usually looks like host/SERVER-NAME.MYREALM.COM.
+
If the Organization Service WSDL reports a User Principal Name (UPN) instead of an SPN, then the CRM service is configured to run under a domain account. In this case, you must ensure that the domain admin has created an SPN under this service account in AD for the CRM hostname. In this case, the SPN is in the form +http://crm.mycompany.com+ – note that the SPN is typically created to match a fully qualified DNS name that is used to access the CRM service.

* *Realm*: The Domain that the user belongs to. Note that this value is case-sensitive and must be specified exactly as defined in Active Directory.
+
* *KDC*: This is usually the Domain Controller (server name or IP).

If the environment is complex and requires further settings, manually create a Kerberos configuration file and reference the file in the connector’s connection configuration.

Sample Kerberos configuration file:

[source,text,linenums]
----
[libdefaults]
default_realm = MYREALM.COM
[realms]
MYREALM.COM = {
    kdc = mydomaincontroller.myrealm.com
    default_domain = MYREALM.COM
}
[domain_realm]
.myrealm.com = MYREALM.COM
myrealm.com = MYREALM.COM
----

*Note:* The `default_realm` and `default_domain` values are case-sensitive. Specify these values exactly as defined in Active Directory.  If you receive an error during Test Connection stating `Message stream modified (41)`, the domain name is not correctly formed.

More information on how to create the Kerberos configuration file can be found at http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-devel/doc/admin/conf_files/krb5_conf.html.

To reference the Kerberos configuration file in a connector's connection configuration:

. Set the property *Kerberos Properties File Path*
. Place the file in the class path (usually under src/main/resources) and set the value of the property to classpath:krb5.conf
+
Or:
+
Provide the full path to the file as in `C:\kerberos\krb5.conf`

You can tune the Kerberos login module (Krb5LoginModule) with scenario-specific configurations by defining a JAAS login configuration file.

Example JAAS login configuration file for the Kerberos login module:

[source,text,linenums]
----
Kerberos {
    com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
    debug=true
    refreshKrb5Config=true;
};
----

For more information on how to create the JAAS login configuration file for the Kerberos login module, see http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/jre/api/security/jaas/spec/com/sun/security/auth/module/Krb5LoginModule.html[Class Krb5LoginModule].

To reference the JAAS login configuration file for the Kerberos login module in a connector's connection configuration:

. Set the property *Login Properties File Path*
. Place the file in the class path (usually under `src/main/resources`) and set the value of the property to `classpath:jaas.conf`  +
Or:  +
 Provide the full path to the file as in `C:\kerberos\jaas.conf`

=== NTLM Authentication

For connecting to Microsoft Dynamics CRM with NTLM authentication, the connector routes requests through _Anypoint Platform Gateway Service_.

The Anypoint Platform Gateway Service runs as a Windows service. Install the gateway service on a machine that is joined to the same domain as the Dynamics CRM instance that you wish to authenticate against.

If you do not have _Anypoint Platform Gateway Service_ installed, you can download it from: https://repository-master.mulesoft.org/nexus/content/repositories/releases/org/mule/modules/anypoint-windows-gateway-service/1.3.0/anypoint-windows-gateway-service-1.3.0.zip.

To install:

. Unzip the downloaded file and run the `.exe` contained within.
. For your protection, the executable is signed by MuleSoft Inc.
. Follow the instructions to complete the installation.
. No further configuration is required.

After installing _Anypoint Platform Gateway Service_, configure the connector’s connection properties with the *Username*, *Password*, and the *Organization Service URL*.

Under _NTLM authentication settings_, set the *Gateway Router Service Address* to the address of the _Anypoint Platform Gateway Service_. This address is usually similar to `+https://myserver.com:9000/router+`.

At this point, the connection should be successfully tested.

== Exceptions Handling

=== Exceptions when Connecting

If the connector fails to connect with the CRM instance for any reason, an exception of type ConnectionException is thrown. The exception message helps debugging the cause of the exception.

=== Exceptions in Operations

Each operation throws a different type of exception. This is useful when defining an exception handling policy.

The following table lists the exception types that are thrown for every operation.

[%header,cols="2*"]

|Retrieve |IOrganizationServiceRetrieveOrganizationServiceFaultFaultFaultMessage
|Retrieve Multiple |IOrganizationServiceRetrieveMultipleOrganizationServiceFaultFaultFaultMessage
|Associate |IOrganizationServiceAssociateOrganizationServiceFaultFaultFaultMessage
|Disassociate |IOrganizationServiceDisassociateOrganizationServiceFaultFaultFaultMessage
|Execute |IOrganizationServiceExecuteOrganizationServiceFaultFaultFaultMessage
|===

== Data Considerations

=== Entity Reference

Entity reference attributes are accessible as String values that match the pattern _myattribute_referenceto_targetentity_.

To avoid conflicts, don't add fields to your CRM instance using this reserved naming scheme: `[*]_referenceto_[*]`.

As an example, the Contact Entity Reference attribute TransactionCurrencyId is Lookup field that targets the entity transactioncurrency. The transactioncurrencyid of the `transactioncurrency` is accessible as a String in the attribute `transactioncurrencyid_referenceto_transactioncurrency`.

The Create and Update operations accept entity reference attributes. Following the example above, to create a Contact targeting a transactioncurrency, set the value of the attribute `transactioncurrencyid_referenceto_transactioncurrency` to the `transactioncurrencyid` of the record to reference.

The Retrieve Multiple Records operation also allows selecting and filtering of Entity Reference attributes. As an example for Contact, the following DataSense Query returns all the contact full names that where created by a particular `systemuserid`:

[source,text,linenums]
----
Select fullname From contact Where createdby_referenceto_systemuser =
'c7a58b13-df19-491c-a918-1bc26eaf6eb3'
----

=== Picklist

Picklist attributes are accessible as Integer values.

As an example, the *Contact* attribute *familystatuscode* is accessible as an Integer value.

=== Money

Money attributes are accessible as BigDecimal values.

As an example, the *Contact* attribute *creditlimit* is accessible as a BigDecimal value.

=== BulkOperationResult<T>

* *isSuccesful*() returns a Boolean value. Is false if any of the results contains an error.
* *getItems*() returns a list of the results. Each result has a correlation and respects the order of the record Created, Updated, or Deleted.
Each item has the following data:
** *isSuccesful*() is false if the operation is faulted.
** *getId*() returns the ID of the created entity in create-multiple operation.
** *getException*() returns the Exception from the backend fault.
**  *getMessage*() returns the message in case isSuccesful() is false.

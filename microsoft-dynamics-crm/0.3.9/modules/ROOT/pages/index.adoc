== CRM Authentication

=== Authentication Schemes

The Microsoft Dynamics CRM connector supports different authentication schemes based on the Microsoft Dynamics CRM that is accessed.

Supported authentication schemes for Microsoft Dynamics CRM on premise:

* Windows Authentication - Kerberos
* Windows Authentication – NTLM (requires Anypoint Gateway for Windows)
* Claims-based Authentication

Supported authentication schemes for Microsoft Dynamics CRM online:

* Live ID
* Office 365

=== Advanced Kerberos Authentication

The preferred method of configuring the connector for Kerberos authentication is to leverage auto-configuration. The prerequisites for automatically detecting Kerberos configuration settings to work are:

* Mule ESB server joined to the same domain as the CRM instance
* AD Domain Controller is accessible from the Mule ESB server

In case the Kerberos configuration settings cannot be automatically detected, you can set the following parameters manually:

* *SPN*: The Service Principal Name can usually be automatically discovered from the Organization Service’s WSDL. If the SPN cannot be discovered automatically, the value has to be set in the connector’s connection configuration property SPN. The SPN usually looks like host/SERVER-NAME.MYREALM.COM.
+
If the Organization Service WSDL reports a User Principal Name (UPN) instead of an SPN, then the CRM service is configured to run under a domain account. In this case, you must ensure that the domain admin has created an SPN under this service account in AD for the CRM hostname. In this case, the SPN is in the form `+http://crm.mycompany.com+` – note that the SPN is typically created to match a fully qualified DNS name that is used to access the CRM service.

* *Realm*: The Domain that the user belongs to. Note that this value is case-sensitive and must be specified exactly as defined in Active Directory.

* *KDC*: This is usually the Domain Controller (server name or IP).

If the environment is complex and requires further settings, manually create a Kerberos configuration file and reference the file in the connector’s connection configuration.

Sample Kerberos configuration file:

[source,text,linenums]
----
[libdefaults]
default_realm = MYREALM.COM
[realms]
MYREALM.COM = {
    kdc = mydomaincontroller.myrealm.com
    default_domain = MYREALM.COM
}
[domain_realm]
.myrealm.com = MYREALM.COM
myrealm.com = MYREALM.COM
----

*Note:* The `default_realm` and `default_domain` values are case-sensitive. Specify these values exactly as defined in Active Directory. If you receive an error during Test Connection stating `Message stream modified (41)`, the domain name is not correctly formed.

More information on how to create the Kerberos configuration file can be found at http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-devel/doc/admin/conf_files/krb5_conf.html.

To reference the Kerberos configuration file in a connector's connection configuration:

. Set the property *Kerberos Properties File Path*
. Place the file in the class path (usually under src/main/resources) and set the value of the property to *classpath:krb5.conf*  +
Or:  +
Provide the full path to the file as in *C:\kerberos\krb5.conf*

You can tune the Kerberos login module (Krb5LoginModule) with scenario-specific configurations by defining a JAAS login configuration file.

Example JAAS login configuration file for the Kerberos login module:

[source,text,linenums]
----
Kerberos {
    com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
    debug=true
    refreshKrb5Config=true;
};
----

For more information on how to create the JAAS login configuration file for the Kerberos login module, see http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/jre/api/security/jaas/spec/com/sun/security/auth/module/Krb5LoginModule.html[Class Krb5LoginModule].

To reference the JAAS login configuration file for the Kerberos login module in a connector's connection configuration:

. Set the property *Login Properties File Path*
. Place the file in the class path (usually under `src/main/resources`) and set the value of the property to `classpath:jaas.conf`
+
Or:
+
Provide the full path to the file as in `C:\kerberos\jaas.conf`

=== NTLM Authentication

For connecting to Microsoft Dynamics CRM with NTLM authentication, the connector routes requests through Anypoint Platform Gateway Service.

The Anypoint Platform Gateway Service runs as a Windows service. Install using the instructions in the xref:3.9@mule-runtime::windows-gateway-services-guide.adoc[Windows Gateway Service guide] on a machine that is joined to the same domain as the Dynamics CRM instance that you want to authenticate against.

IMPORTANT: Windows Gateway Services has an issue that when installed in the same machine as CRM Dynamics, the Host name is resolved to IPv6, which is not supported by NTLM. So this needs to be accessed through IP. In addition, for CRM Dynamics Connector and Windows Gateway Services, when using the CRM Dynamics Connector using NTLM, HTTPS is not supported.

To install Windows Gateway Service:

. Unzip the downloaded file and run the `.exe` contained within.
+
For your protection, the executable is signed by MuleSoft Inc.
+
. Follow the instructions to complete the installation. No further configuration is required.

After installing Anypoint Platform Gateway Service, configure the connector’s connection properties with the *Username*, *Password*, and the *Organization Service URL*.

Under NTLM authentication settings, set the *Gateway Router Service Address* to the address of the Anypoint Platform Gateway Service. This address by default is `+https://myserver:9333/router+`.

At this point, the connection should be successfully tested.

=== CRM Online Authentication

Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online, with Office365, allows federated authentication to known domains. Office365 provides an endpoint to discover the user parameters for federated authentication. In some cases, this discovery is not possible.

For these cases, there are optional connection configuration parameters:

* Sts Metadata Url (optional): The STS's metadata exchange URL. For ADFS, this is usually `+https://mycompany-sts.com/adfs/services/trust/mex+`.
*  Sts Username Port Qname (optional): The name of port that accepts username and password credentials as described in the STS's metadata exchange URL. Specify this value as a `Qname` in the format `{namespace}/port_name`. For ADFS, this is usually:
+
[source]
----
{http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/securitytokenservice}UserNameWSTrustBinding_IWSTrust13Async}
----

== Proxy

Configure the proxy that is used by the connector. This can be specified in the connector's Global Element configuration, under the `Proxy` tab.
The value of the proxy address has to be in the format `{hostname/IP}:{port}`. For example, if the proxy is running in the same server under the port 8080: `127.0.0.1:8080` or `localhost:8080`.

== Metadata Caching

The connector does cache metadata by default.

Metadata is retrieved for data sense and also for allow completing some operations. Default configuration is the recommended way to use the connector, but there might be scenarios where often changes on metadata requires not to use this caching feature.

The metadata retrievers are grouped within three categories as described below:

. Data sense: As data sense requires all entities to be retrieved, the entities retriever does that and caches it by entity to be reused between different calls. In addition, data sense also exposes attributes for each entity, and this is done by an attributes retriever. For data sense the attributes retriever that is used gets all entitiy's attributes and caches it (for each one of the entities for which you perform a data sense operation).
. Attributes: Some operations within the connector require just to retrieve referenced (by the operation) attributes from a entity. The default attribute retriever for these operations works optimizing data throughput doing single attribute querying, while also doing caching. You can configure these operations (Create, Update, CreateMultiple, UpdateMultiple) behavior to share the data sense retriever if works better on your scenario (that is, if you often create or update entities using most of its attributes).
. Relationships: This particular retriever that gets relationships information, and caches it, is just used for the following operations: Associate and Dissasociate.

In the following table you can find custom configuration settings to disable metadata caching on particular subsets of operations and/or to customize the retrievers behavior on particular cases.

All paths are relative to the `org.mule.module.dynamicscrm.metadata.retrievers.` path.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Path |Usage |Values
|nocache |Disable caching for all metadata retrievers |1- disabled, otherwise enabled
|entities.nocache |Disable caching for entities metadata retriever used with data sense only |1- disabled, otherwise enabled
|relationships.nocache |Disable caching for relationships metadata retriever |1- disabled, otherwise enabled
|attributes.nocache |Disable caching for attributes metadata retriever |1- disabled, otherwise enabled
|attributes.share | Share attributes metadata retriever (for metadata scopes and connector's operations). Set this value to '1' to use the full attribute metadata retriever for operations as well as metadata scopes |1- shared, otherwise use single attribute retriever for operations
|===

These system settings can be passed to the VM executing the mule app by doing:

== Maven Dependency Snippet

Make sure that this snippet is included in your Maven project using the connector.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.mule.modules</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-module-ms-dynamics-crm</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
</dependency>
----

Replace `x.x.x` with the version that corresponds to the connector you are using.

To set a `pom.xml` file to a specific version, access the connector in https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange/org.mule.modules/mule-module-ms-dynamics-crm/[Anypoint Exchange], choose a version, and click *Dependency Snippets*.

== Data Considerations

=== Entity Reference

Entity reference attributes are accessible as String values that match the pattern `myattribute_referenceto_targetentity`.

To avoid conflicts, don't add fields to your CRM instance using this reserved naming scheme: `[*]_referenceto_[*]`.

As an example, the Contact Entity Reference attribute `TransactionCurrencyId` is Lookup field that targets the entity `transactioncurrency`. The `transactioncurrencyid` of the `transactioncurrency` is accessible as a String in the attribute `transactioncurrencyid_referenceto_transactioncurrency`.

The Create and Update operations accept entity reference attributes. Following the example above, to create a Contact targeting a `transactioncurrency`, set the value of the attribute `transactioncurrencyid_referenceto_transactioncurrency` to the `transactioncurrencyid` of the record to reference.

The Retrieve Multiple Records operation also allows selecting and filtering of Entity Reference attributes. As an example for Contact, the following DataSense Query returns all the contact full names that where created by a particular `systemuserid`:

[source]
----
Select fullname From contact Where createdby_referenceto_systemuser =
'c7a58b13-df19-491c-a918-1bc26eaf6eb3'
----

=== Party List

A Party List is typically found on email activities to represent the To, Bcc, and Cc attributes. This type of attribute is accessible as a list of `Map<String, String>` objects where each list item represents an <<Entity Reference>>. +
As an example, the *Email* Party List attribute *To* is a list of Lookup objects that can target any of the following entities: *Account*, *Contact*, *Lead*, *Queue*, and *SystemUser*.

The *To* attribute is a List of `Map<String, String>` objects where each Map’s key is one of the following:

[source]
----
to_referenceto_account, to_referenceto_contact, to_referenceto_lead, to_referenceto_queue or to_referenceto_systemuser
----

For an email sent to an `account` and a `contact`, the *To* attribute is:

[source]
----
[{ to_referenceto_account: 42424242-4242-4242-4242-424242424242}, { to_referenceto_contact: 54545454-5454-5454-5454-545454545454} ]
----

=== Picklist

Picklist attributes are accessible as Integer values.

As an example, the *Contact* attribute *familystatuscode* is accessible as an Integer value.

=== Money

Money attributes are accessible as BigDecimal values.

As an example, the *Contact* attribute *creditlimit* is accessible as a BigDecimal value.

=== BulkOperationResult<T>

* *isSuccesful*() returns a Boolean value. Is false if any of the results contains an error.
* *getItems*() returns a list of the results. Each result has a correlation and respects the order of the record Created, Updated, or Deleted. +
Each item has the following data: +
** *isSuccesful*() is false if the operation is faulted.
** *getId*() returns the ID of the created entity in create-multiple operation.
** *getException*() returns the Exception from the backend fault.
**  *getMessage*() returns the message in case isSuccesful() is false.

== Before You Begin

To use this information, you must be familiar with NetSuite OpenAir, Mule runtime engine (Mule), Anypoint Connectors, Anypoint Studio, Mule concepts, elements in a Mule flow, and Global Elements.

To use this connector, you need:

* A NetSuite OpenAir instance
* A set of valid credentials, including username, password, companyID, API namespace, and key.

OpenAir complex types are limited to a set of OpenAir operations.
See the OpenAir documentation for information about its object types. For example, object `oaActualCost` works with `read`, `add`, `modify`, and `upsert` methods, while object `oaApproval` works only with the `submit` method.

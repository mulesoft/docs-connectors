= Troubleshooting Spring Module - Mule 4

To troubleshoot Spring module, become familiar with the information about enabling verbose logging and interpreting commonly thrown messages.

== Enable Verbose Logging

To get a better understanding of why an application's interaction with Spring module is failing, temporarily enable verbose logging for the module.

Remember to always disable the enhanced verbosity after troubleshooting, because it affects your Mule application performance.

To enable verbose logging in the configuration file:

. Access Anypoint Studio and navigate to the *Package Explorer* view.
. Open your application's project name.
. Open the `src/main/resources` path folder.
. Open the `log4j2.xml` file inside the folder.
. Add an `<AsyncLogger>` tag inside the `<Loggers>` tag:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
			<Loggers>
				...
				<AsyncLogger name="org.mule.extension.spring" level="DEBUG"/>
				...
			</Loggers>
----
[start=6]
. Save your application changes.
. Click the project name in *Package Explorer* and then click *Run* > *Run As* > *Mule Application*.


== Understand Common Throws

Here is a list of common throw messages and how to interpret them:

* MULE:NOT_PERMITTED

 Occurs when there is a security restriction enforced by a filter; for example, when using the authorization filter of the Spring module.

* MULE:SERVER_SECURITY

 Occurs when there is a security error enforced by Mule runtime engine (Mule).

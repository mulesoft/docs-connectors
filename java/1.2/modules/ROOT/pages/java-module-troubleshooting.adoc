= Troubleshooting Java Module - Mule 4

To troubleshoot Java module, become familiar with the information about enabling verbose logging and interpreting commonly thrown messages.

== Enable Verbose Logging

To get a better understanding of why an application's interaction with the Java module is failing, temporarily enable verbose logging for the module. +

Remember to always disable the enhanced verbosity after troubleshooting, because it affects your Mule application performance.

To enable verbose logging in the configuration file:

. In Anypoint Studio, navigate to the *Package Explorer* view.
. Open your application's project name.
. Open the `src/main/resources` path folder.
. Open the `log4j2.xml` file inside the folder.
. Add an `<AsyncLogger>` tag inside the `<Loggers>` tag:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
			<Loggers>
				...
				<AsyncLogger name="org.mule.extensions.java" level="DEBUG"/>
				...
			</Loggers>
----
[start=6]
. Save your application changes.
. In Anypoint Studio, click the project name in *Package Explorer* and then click *Run* > *Run As* > *Mule Application*.
.

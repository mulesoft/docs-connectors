= Anypoint MQ Consume Operation - Mule 4

The Consume operation in the Anypoint MQ connector enables the app consume a single message from a queue at any time of the flow, from any destination, using the acknowledgment strategy that supports your use case.

[NOTE]
====
Anypoint MQ supports consuming from queues, not message exchanges.

If an app attempts to consume from a message exchange,
the Anypoint MQ REST API throws the following error:
`The destination should be a queue.`
====

== Incoming Message Structure

Every incoming message consists of two parts:

* `payload` - Represents the message body
* `attributes` - Contains metadata for the received message, such as its ID or other properties

== Message Consumption

The simplest way to consume a message from a queue is to drag the *Consume* operation from the Mule palette to the canvas and configure the `Queue` parameter with the name of the queue from which to retrieve the message:

image::amq-4x-consume-operation.png[Anypoint MQ Consume Operation]

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<anypoint-mq:consume config-ref="Anypoint_MQ_config" destination="myQueue"/>
----

The Consume operation in this example consumes the first available message in `myQueue` and converts it to a `MuleMessage` instance with this structure:

* The message body as payload.
* The message metadata in the message attributes. Attributes might include `messageId` or `redeliveryCount`.

Use a DataWeave expression in the `Queue` parameter to dynamically change the target queue from which to consume the message.


== Consumed Message Acknowledgment

* *Automatic*
+
By default, `acknowledgementMode` is `IMMEDIATE`, meaning that the message is acknowledged as soon as it is consumed from the queue and before it's delivered to the Mule flow. If the message acknowledgment fails, the Consume operation terminates with an `ANYPOINT-MQ:ACKING` error.
+
For more information, see xref:anypoint-mq-ack.adoc#immediate-acknowledgment[Immediate Acknowledgment].

* *Manual*
+
To manually control the acknowledgment of the message, change `acknowledgementMode` to `MANUAL`. When using the `MANUAL` acknowledgment mode, the app logic decides when to perform the acknowledgment of the message, using the xref:anypoint-mq-ack.adoc[ACK] or xref:anypoint-mq-ack.adoc[NACK] operations.
+
To perform the manual acknowledgment, you need the value of `ackToken` provided as part of the resulting message attributes.
+
For more information, see xref:anypoint-mq-ack.adoc#manual-acknowledgment[Manual Acknowledgment].

For information about acknowledgment timeouts, see xref:anypoint-mq-ack.adoc#acknowledgment-timeout[Acknowledgment Timeout].

== Empty Queue Management

When a queue has messages, the Consume operation returns immediately with one of the messages.

When a queue is empty, the operation behavior depends on the value of the `pollingTime` parameter:

* No value
+
By default, the Consume operation waits for 10000 milliseconds (10 seconds) for a new message to arrive when consuming from an empty queue.
+
If Anypoint MQ receives no messages in that time, Consume fails with an `ANYPOINT-MQ:TIMEOUT` error.

* `0`
+
If the value of `pollingTime` is `0`, the Consume operation waits for the default of 10000 milliseconds (10 seconds).
+
If Anypoint MQ receives no messages in that time, Consume produces a `null` message as the result and doesn't produce an error.

* `1` to `20000`
+
If the value of `pollingTime` is between one and 20000 milliseconds (the maximum value),
Consume waits for the time specified by `pollingTime` for a new message to arrive.
+
If Anypoint MQ receives no messages within the given time window, Consume fails with an `ANYPOINT-MQ:TIMEOUT` error.

* If the value of `pollingTime` is outside the range of 0-20000 milliseconds (20 seconds),
Consume fails with an `ANYPOINT-MQ:CONSUMING` error.

== Output Message Metadata

Each message received consists of two parts: `Payload` and `Attributes`. `Attributes` contains the metadata for the message.

This metadata maps all the information available in an Anypoint MQ message, including:

* Message ID
* Headers Map
* Properties Map

For information about the `attributes` structure, see the Consume operation in the xref:anypoint-mq-connector-reference.adoc#consume[Anypoint MQ Connector Reference - 4.x].

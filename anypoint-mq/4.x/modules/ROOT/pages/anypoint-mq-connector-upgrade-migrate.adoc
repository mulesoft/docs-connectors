== Changes in This Release

Some changes included in version 4.x break backward compatibility with version 3.x.

Anypoint MQ Connector 4.x includes support for these features:

* Cross-Region Failover
+
Anypoint MQ Connector for Mule 4 version 4.0.7 and later provides failover capability for standard queues.
+
When enabled, if a Mule app canâ€™t reach an Anypoint MQ server in a region, the connector switches to the fallback queue in the fallback region to publish and consume messages.
+
For information, see:
+
** xref:mq::mq-failover.adoc[]
** xref:anypoint-mq-failover.adoc[]

* Connected Apps
+
Anypoint MQ Connector for Mule 4 version 4.0.1 and later includes a new format for the *URL* field in the *Global Element Properties* page.
+
--
** In Anypoint MQ Connector 3.x, the URL format was:
+
`+https://mq-us-east-1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v1+`
** In Anypoint MQ Connector 4.x, the URL format includes `{orgID}` and `{envID}`. For example:
+
`+https://mq-us-east-1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v1/organizations/{orgID}/environments/{envID}+`
--
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you configure the connector with the wrong version of the URL,
Anypoint MQ returns the following error:

`Invalid api url provided`
====

To use the failover feature, see xref:anypoint-mq-failover.adoc[].

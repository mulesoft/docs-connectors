:page-aliases: connectors::anypoint-mq/2.x/anypoint-mq-connector.adoc

Support Category: Select

The Anypoint MQ connector provides publish-subscribe messaging to Mule apps using the Anypoint MQ cloud service.

Anypoint MQ supports a wide range of messaging use cases: enterprise messaging patterns, asynchronous communications between microservices, IoT, and more. Anypoint MQ also has a REST API for publishing or consuming messages using any framework such as node.js, Java, Go, and devops bash scripts.

For more information, see the xref:mq::index.adoc[Anypoint MQ documentation set] and additional resources listed in <<See Also>>.

<anypoint-mq:default-subscriber-config name="MQ_Configuration">
    <anypoint-mq:connection url="https://mq-us-east-1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v1"
    clientId="${env.clientId}" clientSecret="${env.clientSecrete}"/>
</anypoint-mq:default-subscriber-config>

<flow name="producerFlow">
  <anypoint-mq:subscriber config="MQ_Configuration" destination="${inbound}"/>

  <http:request config-ref="Invoice_API" method="POST" path="/invoicesProcessing" >
    <http:body>#[output application/json ---
    {
        body : payload,
        origin : attributes.message.properties.orgId,

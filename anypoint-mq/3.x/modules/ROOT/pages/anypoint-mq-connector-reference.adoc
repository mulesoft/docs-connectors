== Configurations
---
[[config]]
=== Config


==== Parameters
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | Specifies the name for this configuration. Connectors refer to the configuration by using this name. | | x
| Connection a| <<config_connection, Connection>>
 | Specifies the connection types to provide to this configuration. | | x
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> | Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for purging. The platform purges expired instances as needed to free resources.  |  |
|===

==== Connection Types
[[config_connection]]
===== Connection


====== Parameters
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| URL a| String |  The region URL for the queue from the *Anypoint Platform > MQ* console |  ++https://mq-us-east-1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v1++ |
| Client App ID a| String |  The Client App ID from *Anypoint Platform > MQ > Client Apps* |  | x
| Client Secret a| String |  The Client Secret field from *Anypoint Platform > MQ > Client Apps*|  | x
| TLS Context a| <<Tls>> |  |  |
| Host a| String |  Destination host for proxy requests |  |
| Port a| Number | Destination port for proxy requests |  |
| Username a| String |  Username to authenticate against the proxy |  |
| Password a| String |  Password to authenticate against the proxy |  |
| Send Buffer Size a| Number |  Size of the buffer (in bytes) used when sending data, set on the socket itself|  |
| Receive Buffer Size a| Number |  Size of the buffer (in bytes) used when receiving data |  |
| Client Timeout a| Number |  SO_TIMEOUT value on sockets. Indicates the amount of time (in milliseconds) that the socket waits in a blocking operation before failing.  A value of 0 (the default) indicates an indefinite wait. |  |
| Send TCP With No Delay a| Boolean |  If set, transmitted data is not grouped but sent immediately.  Defaults to true. |  true |
| Linger a| Number |  SO_LINGER value, which determines how long (in milliseconds) the socket takes to close so that any remaining data is transmitted correctly |  |
| Keep Alive a| Boolean |  SO_KEEPALIVE behavior on open sockets, which automatically checks open socket connections that are unused for long periods, and closes them if the connection becomes unavailable. This is a property on the socket itself and is used by a server socket to control whether connections to the server are kept alive before they are recycled. |  false |
| Connection Timeout a| Number |  Number of milliseconds to wait until an outbound connection to a remote server is successfully created, before failing with a timeout. Defaults to 30 seconds. |  30000 |
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to true, deployment fails if the deployment connectivity test to each connector fails. |  |

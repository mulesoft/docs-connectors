VM Connector v2.0

Anypoint Connector for Virtual Machine (VM) (VM Connector) handles intra-app and inter-app communication through asynchronous queues that can be transient or persistent. The communication is done through asynchronous queues, which can be either transient or persistent. Transient queues are faster, but not reliable in the case of a system crash. Persistent queues, on the other hand are slower but reliable.

When running on a single instance, persistent queues work by serializing and storing the contents on to disk. When running in cluster mode, persistent queues are instead backed by the memory grid. This means that when a flow uses the VM connector to publish content to a queue, the Runtime decides whether to process that message in the same origin node or to send it out to the cluster for another node to pick it up. This is an easy way to distribute load across the cluster. In either way, transactions are always supported.

Each configuration defines its own set of queues. Those queues are only visible to components referencing that config.

== Operations

[[consume]]
=== Consume
`<vm:consume>`

Pull a message from a queue. If a message is not immediately available, the Consume operation waits for up to the configured `queueTimeout` value, after which a VM:QUEUE_TIMEOUT error is thrown.

The flow in which the content is published cannot contain a Listener (`<vm:listener>`) source.

| Queue Name a| String |  The name of the queue. |  | x

[[publishConsume]]
=== Publish Consume

`<vm:publish-consume>`

Publishes the given content into a queue, and then waits up to the queueTimeout for a response to be supplied on a temporal reply-To queue that this operation automatically creates.

The temporal reply queue is automatically disposed after a response is received or the timeout expires.

The flow in which the content is published cannot contain a Listener (`<vm:listener>`) source.

== Sources

[[listener]]

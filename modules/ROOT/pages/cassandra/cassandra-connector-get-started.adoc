Cassandra Connector v3.1.1

The Anypoint CassandraDB connector creates connectivity between Cassandra databases and third-party applications, systems, services such as SAP, PeopleSoft, or Workday, as well as other databases across the enterprise.
Apache Cassandra is an open source distributed NoSQL database intended to manage large amounts of product, customer, and employee data.
The Cassandra connector implements the DataStax Java Driver for Apache Cassandra 3.1.

== About Connectors

Anypoint Connectors are extensions of Mule that let you work with external systems such as Cassandra, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, Twitter, and more to send and receive information from these systems to create something new.
Anypoint Connectors let you connect Mule applications to APIs and resources.
A connector lets you send and receive data over a protocol, or to and from an API.
Use this information to work with Design Center or Anypoint Studio to adjust the UI settings to enable the connector to work with a Mule application.

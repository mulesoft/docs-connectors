Validation Module v1.4

The Validation module can verify that the contents of a message in a Mule flow match specific criteria. The module provides explicit messages about the cause of an exception in a flow. Based on the specific data you are validating, you can customize the exception message that is displayed in the logs.

A module that performs data validations. If the validation fails, an Error is thrown. The error type might vary but it will always be a child of VALIDATION:VALIDATION.

If a message does not meet the defined validation criteria, the validation fails and returns a `VALIDATION` error (such as `VALIDATION:INVALID_URL`), which is a `ValidationException`. By default, this message includes a meaningful message that you can customize.

=== Default Configuration


Default configuration


==== Parameters
[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%,.^20%,^.^5%", options="header"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | |x
| I18n a| <<i18n>> |  Allows to configure I18n for the standard error messages |  |
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform will expire the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime actually purge the instances as it sees fit. |  |

A module which allows to perform data validations. If the validation fails, an Error is thrown. The error type might vary but it will always be a child of VALIDATION:VALIDATION
+++


== Configurations

[[config]]
=== Config

+++
Default configuration

==== Parameters
[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%,.^20%,^.^5%", options="header"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | *x*{nbsp}
| I18n a| <<i18n>> |  +++Allows to configure I18n for the standard error messages+++ |  | {nbsp}
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  +++Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform will expire the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime will actually purge the instances when it sees it fit.+++ |  | {nbsp}

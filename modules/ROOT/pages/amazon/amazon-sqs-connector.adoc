Amazon SQS Connector Version v5.4.1

Anypoint Connector for Amazon SQS (Amazon SQS Connector) provides an easy way to interface with the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) API, enabling Mule users to manage SQS queueing services without having to interact with the API directly.

Amazon SQS offers a reliable, highly scalable hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between computers. By using Amazon SQS, developers can move data between distributed application components and perform different tasks without losing messages or requiring each component to be always available. Amazon SQS makes it easy to build an automated workflow that works closely with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and other AWS infrastructure web services.

The AWS SDK for Java provides a Java API for AWS infrastructure services. Amazon SQS Connector is built using the SDK for Java.

== Queue Support

Amazon SQS Connector provides support for two types of queues:

* Standard Queues
+
Standard queues have high throughput. However, using these queues can occasionally result in having duplicate copies of messages delivered out of order.
+
* FIFO Queues
+
FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues deliver messages in the order in which they are sent. However, these queues have limited throughput.

For information about creating FIFO queues, see xref:amazon/amazon-sqs-connector-config-topics.adoc[Additional Configuration Topics].

Amazon S3 Connector Version 5.3.2.

The Anypoint Amazon S3 connector provides connectivity to the Amazon S3 API, enabling you to interface with Amazon S3 to store objects, download, and use data with other AWS services, and build applications that require internet storage.

Instant access to the Amazon S3 API enables seamless integrations between Amazon S3 and other databases, CMS applications such as Drupal, and CRM applications such as Salesforce. Use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web. You can accomplish these tasks by using the simple and intuitive web interface of the AWS Management Console.

The AWS SDK for Java provides a Java API for AWS infrastructure services.
The Amazon S3 connector is built using the SDK for Java.

* Understand how o create a Mule app using Design Center or Anypoint Studio.

For the Amazon S3 connector operations to work, you need to enable or update the subset of the overall list of Amazon S3 actions in the bucket to specify that the AWS account has access to these actions.

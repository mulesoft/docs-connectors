The Flow Designer feature of Anypoint Design Center enables you to create apps visually. To use Flow Designer, work with your Anypoint Platform administrator to ensure that you have a xref:access-management::environments.adoc#to-create-a-new-environment[Design environment].

To create an app in Flow Designer:

* Configure the input source (trigger) for your app.

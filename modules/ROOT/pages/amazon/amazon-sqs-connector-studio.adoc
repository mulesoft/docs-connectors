To configure a connector in Anypoint Studio:

. Install the connector.
. Configure an input source for the connector.
. Configure the connector.

== Install the Connector

Installing the connector adds it to a Studio project. Anypoint Studio provides two ways to install a connector:

* Use the Exchange application in the Studio taskbar.

* Use the Exchange icon in the Mule Palette view.

=== Install the Connector from the Studio Taskbar

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. Click the Exchange icon *(X)* in the upper left of the Studio task bar.
. In Exchange, click *Login* and supply your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. In Exchange, search for `Amazon SQS`.
. Select *Amazon SQS*.
. Click *Add to project*.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

=== Install the Connector from the Mule Palette View

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. In the Mule Palette view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Modules to Project*, type `Amazon SQS` in the search field.
. Click the connector name in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

== Configure an Input Source

Configure an input source for the connector, such as a connector operation, HTTP Listener, or Schedule.

== Configure the Connector

To use Amazon SQS Connector in your Mule application, configure a global element that can be used by all Amazon SQS Connectors in the application.

. Drag a connector operation onto the Studio canvas.
. To create a global element for the connector, click the *Global Elements* tab at the base of the canvas, and then click *Create*.
. In the *Choose Global Type* window, expand *Connector Configuration* and select *Amazon SQS Configuration*:
+

+
. Click *OK*.
. Specify the global element properties.
+
You can either enter your credentials into the global configuration properties or reference a configuration placed in a file in the `src` folder of your project file that contains these values. For simpler maintenance and better reuse of your project, use a configuration file:
+
image::amazon/amazon-sqs-studio-global-config.png[Configure Global Element]
+
. Configure the parameters as follows:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|Name | Name used to reference the configuration
|Access Key |Alphanumeric text string that uniquely identifies the user who owns the account
|Secret Key |Key that acts as a password
|Try AWS Credentials Provider Chain|Drop-down menu that controls whether temporary credentials should be used
|Region Endpoint |Regional endpoint to process your requests
|Default Global URL |URL of the Amazon SQS queue to act upon
|===
+
When you provide a queue URL in the *Default Global Queue URL* field of the global element, the connector automatically creates the queue and sets the URL of this queue as the provided value. All Amazon SQS message processors that reference the global element perform operations using this queue URL.
+
To reference a different queue URL for a particular message processor in the flow, perform the operation using the `Queue URL` attribute provided by the message processor.
. Leave the default entries for the *Proxy* and *Advanced* tabs.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that the parameters of your global configuration are accurate and that Mule is able to connect successfully to your instance of Amazon SQS.
. Click *OK*.

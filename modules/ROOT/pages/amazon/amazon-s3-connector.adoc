Amazon S3 Connector v5.3.2

The Anypoint Amazon S3 connector provides connectivity to the Amazon S3 API, enabling you to interface with Amazon S3 to store objects, download and use data with other AWS services, and build applications that require internet storage.

Instant access to the Amazon S3 API enables seamless integrations between Amazon S3 and other databases, CMS applications such as Drupal, and CRM applications such as Salesforce. Use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web. You can accomplish these tasks by using the simple and intuitive web interface of the AWS Management Console.

The AWS SDK for Java provides a Java API for AWS infrastructure services.
The Amazon S3 connector is built using the SDK for Java.

== About Connectors

Anypoint connectors are Mule runtime engine extensions that enable you to connect to APIs and resources on external systems, such as Salesforce, Amazon S3, ServiceNow, and Twitter.

== Prerequisites

Before creating an app, you must have access to the Amazon S3 target resource, Amazon Web Services, and Anypoint Platform. You must also understand how to create a Mule app using Design Center or Anypoint Studio, and have AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials.

[NOTE]
For the Amazon S3 operations to work, you need to enable or update the subset of the overall list of actions in the Amazon S3 bucket to specify that the AWS account has access these actions.

To see a list of Amazon S3 operations, see the xref:amazon/amazon-s3-connector-reference.adoc[Amazon S3 Connector Reference].

== Operations

[[abortMultipartUpload]]
=== Abort Multipart Upload
`<s3:abort-multipart-upload>`

Aborts a multipart upload. After a multipart upload is aborted, no additional parts can be uploaded using that upload ID. The storage consumed by any previously uploaded parts will be freed. However, if any part uploads are currently in progress, those part uploads may or may not succeed. As a result, it may be necessary to abort a given multipart upload multiple times to completely free all storage consumed by all parts.

==== Parameters
[%header,cols="20s,20a,35a,20a,5a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Configuration | String | The name of the configuration to use. | | x
| Bucket Name a| String |  The name of the bucket containing the multipart upload to abort. |  | x
| Key a| String |  The key of the multipart upload to abort. |  | x
| Upload Id a| String |  The ID of the upload to abort. |  | x
| Reconnection Strategy a| * <<reconnect>>
* <<reconnect-forever>> |  A retry strategy in case of connectivity errors. |  |

[[copyObject]]
=== Copy Object
`<s3:copy-object>`

Copies a source object to a new destination. To copy an object, the caller's account must have read access to the source object and write access to the destination bucket. By default, all object metadata for the source object is copied to the new destination object, unless new object metadata is specified.

The AccessControlList (ACL) is not copied to the new object, and is set to PRIVATE unless a new ACL is specified.

If no destination bucket is specified, the same bucket as the source bucket is used (local copy). The estimation object's `Content-Type` HTTP header is set with the specified value. If it is passed null, then the default MIME type `application/octet-stream` is set.

[[createBucket]]
=== Create Bucket
`<s3:create-bucket>`

Creates a new bucket. The connector must not be configured as anonymous for this operation to succeed. Bucket names must be unique across all of Amazon S3, that is, among all Amazon S3 users. Bucket ownership is similar to the ownership of Internet domain names. Within Amazon S3, only a single user owns each bucket. Once a uniquely named bucket is created in Amazon S3, you can organize and name the objects within the bucket in any way.

Ownership of the bucket is retained as long as the owner has an Amazon S3 account. To conform with DNS requirements, buckets names must be between 3 and 63 characters long. They must not contain underscores, adjacent periods, dashes next to periods, or uppercase characters. Also they must not end with a dash.

Do not make bucket create or delete calls in the high availability code path of an application. Create or delete buckets in a separate initialization or setup.

[[deleteBucketWebsiteConfiguration]]
=== Delete Bucket Website Configuration
`<s3:delete-bucket-website-configuration>`


Removes the website configuration for a bucket. This operation requires the DeleteBucketWebsite permission. By default, only the bucket owner can delete the website configuration attached to a bucket. However, bucket owners can grant other users permission to delete the website configuration by writing a bucket policy granting them the `S3:DeleteBucketWebsite` permission.

Invoking this operation on a bucket with no website configuration doesn't fail. Invoking this operation for a non-existing bucket fails.


==== Parameters
[%header,cols="20s,20a,35a,20a,5a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Configuration | String | The name of the configuration to use. | | x

[[deleteObject]]
=== Delete Object
`<s3:delete-object>`


Deletes a given object. Only the owner of the bucket containing the version can perform this operation. If a version is specified, versioning must be enabled.

Once deleted, there is no method to restore the version. Otherwise, once deleted, the object can only be restored if versioning was enabled when the object was deleted. If you attempt to delete an object that does not exist, Amazon S3 returns a success message instead of an error message.

| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Configuration | String | The name of the configuration to use. | | x

| Key a| String |  The object's key. |  | x
| Version Id a| String |  The specific version of the object to delete, if versioning is enabled. |  |

=== Get Bucket Website Configuration
`<s3:get-bucket-website-configuration>`

Returns the website of the given bucket. This operation requires the GetBucketWebsite permission. By default, only the bucket owner can read the bucket website configuration. However, bucket owners can allow other users to read the website configuration by writing a bucket policy granting them the GetBucketWebsite permission.

[[getObject]]
=== Get Object
`<s3:get-object>`

Returns the object stored in Amazon S3 under the specified bucket and key. Returns null if the specified constraints weren't met. To get an object from Amazon S3, the caller must have com.amazonaws.services.s3.model.Permission#Read access to the object.

Callers should be very careful when using this method because the returned Amazon S3 object contains a direct stream of data from the HTTP connection. The underlying HTTP connection cannot be closed until the user finishes reading the data and closes the stream. Regarding conditional get constraints, Amazon S3 ignores any future dates.

| Target Variable a| String |  The name of a variable to store the operation's output. |  |
| Target Value a| String |  An expression to evaluate against the operation's output and store the expression outcome in the target variable. |  #[payload] |

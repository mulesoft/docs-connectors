Design Center enables you to create apps visually. To use Design Center, work with your Anypoint Platform administrator to ensure that you have a xref:access-management::environments.adoc#to-create-a-new-environment[Design environment]. For more information, see the xref:design-center::fd-tour.adoc[Flow Designer Tour].

To create an app in Design Center:

* Configure the input source (trigger) for your app.
* Add the connector as a component to process the input for the app.

For information on Design Center field values, see the xref:amazon/amazon-s3-connector-reference.adoc[Amazon S3 Connector Reference].

== Configure the Trigger

. In Design Center, click *Create*.
. Click *Create new application*.
. Specify a value for *Project name*, and click *Create*.
. Exit from *Let's get started* by clicking *Go straight to canvas*.
. Click on the trigger card.
. If you are using your connector as an input source trigger, search for the connector; otherwise, search for HTTP or Scheduler.
. Complete the fields with the values you want to configure for your trigger.

You can use the following Amazon S3 operations as triggers:

* *On Deleted Object* - Initiates access to your app when an Amazon S3 object is deleted.
* *On New Object* - Initiates access to your app when an Amazon S3 object is created.

== Configure the Target Component

. Click “+” next to the trigger card.
. In *Select a component*, search for the connector name.
. Select the connector name.
. Select an operation for the connector.
. Enter the required values in the *General* tab.
. If needed, enter values in the *Advanced* tab.
. Click *Edit* and enter required values:
* To configure the *Basic* connection type, enter these values:

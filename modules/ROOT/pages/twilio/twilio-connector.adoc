Twilio is a cloud communications infrastructure as a service (IaaS).

The Twilio platform serves APIs for text messaging, VoIP, and voice calls. The Anypoint Connector for Twilio provides connectivity to the Twilio text messaging API.

This connector provides an API for sending and receiving text messages. To get started with Twilio, follow the steps below to gain access to their free sandbox service to send SMS text messages. You can configure the Twilio connector in Anypoint Studio with your API credentials.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Twilio, Mule, Anypoint Connectors, Anypoint Studio, Mule concepts, elements in a Mule flow, and Global Elements.

You need login credentials to test your connection to your target resource.

For hardware and software requirements and compatibility
information, see the Connector Release Notes.

To use this connector with Maven, view the pom.xml dependency information in
the Dependency Snippets in Anypoint Exchange.

*Note:* To use the Twilio connector, you must have an active Twilio.com account, either as a Trial or Paid. To create a Twilio account, browse to the Try Twilio web site at the `+https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio+` URL.

== What's New in this Connector

Support for Mule 4 has been added.

== To Create a New Twilio Account

To create a new Twilio account:

. Browse to the Try Twilio web site at the `+https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio+` URL.
. Sign up and click Get Started.
+
With a free developer account, you need to verify your SMS-enabled phone before you can send text messages to it.
+
. When prompted, enter your cell phone number. Follow the instructions provided to validate your number. You receive an automated text message and an authorization code.
. After you enter the authorization code, Twilio takes you to the main screen.
. Note the Account SID and Auth Token values, and copy the credentials for later use in the Twilio connector configuration menu in Anypoint Studio.
+
Tip: As you copy fields from the Twilio website to the Anypoint Studio connector configuration, be sure to not copy in additional leading and trailing characters or spaces. It is a good idea to visually confirm that your copy and paste functions did not capture surrounding characters.
+
. Click Phone Numbers > Manage Numbers
. Click Get Started.
. Click Get Your First Twilio Phone Number. Twilio lists the number for you. Copy this number for later use.

== To Connect in Design Center

. In Design Center, click Create and choose Mule Application.
. Click a trigger such as an HTTP Listener or the Scheduler trigger.
+

For more information about each format, see the See Also section at the end of this document.

== Use Case: Studio

In the following example, a Mule application sends a message to a phone number, and then redacts it.

This example uses variables for field values. You can provide actual values for each variable by using a properties file. Place the file at `/src/main/resources` and use the tag `<configuration-properties>` to point to the file. For more information, see xref:mule-runtime::configuring-properties.adoc#properties-files[Properties Files].

. Create a new Mule application and add the following properties to the properties file:
+
[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Property |Description
|accountSid |Your account SID
|authToken |Your authentication token
|fromNumber |The phone number from which the SMS is to be sent. This is configured inside the Twilio instance.
|===
+
. Add an empty flow, drag an HTTP connector to the inbound part of the flow, and set its path to `/send/{toNumber}`.
. Drag a Transform message component to the flow and prepare the input for the Twilio connector:
+
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/java
---
{
    Body: "You are now subscribed!",
    From: "${fromNumber}",
    To: "+" ++ attributes.uriParams.toNumber default "my default value"
}
----
+
. Add a Twilio Connector after the Transform message component and apply the following settings:
** Select the Send Message operation.
** Set Account Sid to `${accountSid}`, and Entity Reference to `#[payload]`.
+
. Drag a Set Variable component and configure the following parameters:
** Set Name to `messageSid`.
** Set Value to `#[payload.getSid()]`.
+
. Add another Transform message component to create the input for the Redact Message operation:
+
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/java
---
{
    Body: "",
    From: payload.from,
    To: payload.'to'
}
----
+
. Drag a Twilio Connector after the Transform message component and apply the following settings:
** Select the Redact Message operation.
** Set Account Sid to `${accountSid}`.
** Set Message Sid to `#[messageSid]` (this is the variable we stored two steps above).
** Set Entity Reference to `#[payload]`.
+
. Put a Transform message component at the end of the flow.
. Run the application and point your browser to `+http://localhost:8081/send/{toNumber}+`, replacing the `toNumber` with the phone number that you got from Twilio.

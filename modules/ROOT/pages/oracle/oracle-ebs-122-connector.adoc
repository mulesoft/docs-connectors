The Oracle E-Business Suite 12.2 Connector facilitates connections between Mule integration and Oracle E-Business Suite 12.2 applications.

== About the Connector Architecture

Oracle EBS offers different technologies or products to address various types of integrations. The most widely used integrations for enterprise applications are:

* Data-centric integration.
* Integration through Web Services using Integrated SOA gateway.

The following illustration shows the integration architecture of the MuleSoft Oracle EBS connector:

image::oracle/oracle-ebs122-architecture.png[Oracle EBS 12.2 - Connector Architecture]


== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule, Anypoint Connectors, Anypoint Studio, Mule concepts, elements in a Mule flow, and Global Elements.

You need login credentials to test your connection to your target resource.

For hardware and software requirements and compatibility
information, see the Connector Release Notes.

To use this connector with Maven, view the pom.xml dependency information in
the Dependency Snippets in Anypoint Exchange.

== What's New in this Connector

Support for Mule 4 has been added.

== To Connect in Design Center

. In Design Center, click Set Up > Upload, browse for and select the driver for this connector on your file system, and upload it. Alternatively, search for and select a driver that is already uploaded.
. Click a trigger. You can create a global element by selecting this connector as they trigger.
If a global element is not needed, you can use an HTTP Listener or Scheduler trigger.
+
image::oracle/oracle-ebs122-trigger.png[Trigger options]
+
. To create an HTTP global element for the connector, set these fields:
+

== To Connect in Anypoint Studio 7

You can use this connector in Anypoint Studio by adding it as a dependency in your Mule application.

=== Install the Connector in Studio

. Open your Mule project in Anypoint Studio.
. Add the connector as a dependency in the pom.xml file:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.mule.modules</groupId>
  <artifactId>oracle-ebs-122-extension</artifactId>
  <version>2.0.0</version>
  <classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
</dependency>
----

== To Use the Connector

. Deploy the REST Service location so that you can later expose your PL/SQL services for the connector to consume. See the Oracle Developer's Guide Tutorial link in the See Also section.
+
The following steps describe the procedure to deploy the PL/SQL Adjustment API as a REST service. The same guide applies to any PL/SQL.
+
. Log in to the Oracle E-Business Suite as a user who has the Integration Administrator role.
. Select the Integrated SOA Gateway responsibility and the Integration Repository link from the navigation menu.
. In the Integration Repository tab, click Search to access the main Search page.
. Click Show More Search Options to display more search fields.
. Enter the following key search values as the search criteria:
** Category: Interface Subtype
** Category Value: PL/SQL
** Internal Name: FA_ADJUSTMENT_PUB
+
image::oracle/oracle-ebs122-deploy-plsql-1.png[Deploy PL/SQL - Search]
+
. Click Go to execute the search.
. Click the Adjustments API link to see the interface details.
+
image::oracle/oracle-ebs122-deploy-plsql-2.png[Deploy PL/SQL - Adjustment API]
+
. Click the REST Service Locator interface name link to open the interface details page.
. In the REST Web Service tab, enter the following information:
+
image::oracle/oracle-ebs122-deploy-plsql-3.png[Deploy PL/SQL - Adjustment API Configuration]
+
*Important:* The alias of the deployed web service MUST be: +
1) The internal name. +
2) In lowercase. The alias information can be found under the Service Alias label. In this example, it is fa_adjustment_pub.
+
. Click Deploy to deploy the service to an Oracle E-Business Suite WebLogic environment.
+
After the REST service successfully deploys, Deployed appears in the REST Service Status field along with the View WADL link.
+
. Click the View WADL link to view the deployed service WADL description.
+
image::oracle/oracle-ebs122-deploy-plsql-4.png[Deploy PL/SQL - Adjustment API Deployed]


== To Configure in Studio

. Drag and drop the connector to the Anypoint Studio canvas.
. Configure the Global element for the connector.
+
image::oracle/oracle-ebs122-config-studio11.png[config connector]
+

[log-requests-responses]]
== Log Requests and Responses

To log requests and responses when using the connector, configure a logger by adding this line to the `Loggers` element of the `log4j2.xml` configuration file for the Mule app:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<AsyncLogger name="name="org.mule.service.http.impl.service.HttpMessageLogger" level="DEBUG"/>
----

The following example shows the `Loggers` element with the `AsyncLogger` line added:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Configuration status="WARN">
	<Appenders>
	    <Console name="Console" target="SYSTEM_OUT">
	    	<PatternLayout pattern="%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%t] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n"/>
		</Console>
	</Appenders>
	<Loggers>
		<AsyncLogger name="org.mule.service.http.impl.service.HttpMessageLogger" level="DEBUG" additivity="false">
			<appender-ref ref="Console" level="debug"/>
		</AsyncLogger>
	</Loggers>
</Configuration>
----

You can view the app log  as follows:

* If you’re running the app from the Anypoint Platform, the output is visible in the Anypoint Studio console window.

* If you’re running the app using Mule from the command line, the app log is visible in your OS console.

Unless the log file path was customized in the app’s log file (`log4j2.xml`), you can also view the app log in this default location:

`MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`

For more information about the app log, see xref:mule-runtime::logging-in-mule.adoc[Configuring Logging].

== Use Case: Studio

Follow the steps below to create an Oracle EBS 12.2 global element for web services and PL/SQL invocation:

image::oracle/oracle-ebs122-flow.png[flow example]

. Create a new Mule Project in Studio and select an HTTP Listener as a source in the new flow.
. Add a new HTTP Listener Configuration global element:
.. Specify the Host and port parameters with the following values:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Parameter |Value
|Host |0.0.0.0
|Port |8081
|===
+
.. Click the Save button.
. Assign your new  Global configuration to your HTTP Listener.
. Specify the HTTP Listener path as the `/start` value.
. Drag and drop a Transform Message element and add it the following code:
+
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/xml
ns ns0 http://xmlns.oracle.com/apps/per/rest/hr_location_api/create_location/
---
{
  ns0#InputParameters: {
    ns0#P_VALIDATE: 0,
    ns0#P_EFFECTIVE_DATE: now,
    ns0#P_LOCATION_CODE: "HR- MuleSoft Office”,
    ns0#P_DESCRIPTION: "Description Office "
  }
}
----
+
. Drag and drop a new Oracle E-Business Suite 12.2 component in the flow.
. Configure the Oracle E-Business Suite 12.2 connector global element with its environment values under General tab.
. In the properties editor of Oracle E-Business Suite 12.2 connector, set PL/SQL to hr_location_api and the Operation to CREATE_LOCATION:
+
image::oracle/oracle-ebs122-operation1.png[Oracle Create Location]
+
. Copy the following content under the Message > Body section:
+
----
#[payload]
----
+
. Save and run the project as a Mule Application.
. Test the application by navigating to `+http://127.0.0.1:8081/start+`

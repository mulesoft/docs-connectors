Anypoint Connector for Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) provides real-time connectivity to query and update Oracle EBS using web services and message queues. The connector has been developed for the Oracle EBS v12.1.x.

Oracle EBS connector provides integration to the following:

* Financial Management and Order Management Modules: Full API coverage for Financials and Order Management services.
* PL/SQL Integration: Both standard PL/SQL or user-defined PL/SQL can be invoked.
* XML Gateway: Inbound and Outbound, to send and receive message to and from EBS.
* Business Events: The ability to receive messages when an event is fired in EBS, via the `WF_JMS_JMS_OUT` topic.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule, Anypoint Connectors, Anypoint Studio, Mule concepts, elements in a Mule flow, and Global Elements.

You need login credentials to test your connection to your target resource.

To use this connector with Maven, view the pom.xml dependency information in
the Dependency Snippets in Anypoint Exchange.

== Connector Architecture

Oracle EBS offers different technologies or products to address various types of integrations. Listed below are the most widely used for integration with enterprise applications:

. Data-centric integration.
. Event-driven integration using Oracle Business Event System and XML Gateway queues.
. Integration through Web Services using Integrated SOA gateway.

== To Connect in Design Center

. Click a trigger. You can use this connector as the trigger, or an HTTP Listener or Scheduler trigger. For
JMS, you need to supply drivers that come with your Oracle software.
. In Design Center, click Set Up > Upload, browse for and select the driver for this connector on your file system, and upload it. Alternatively, search for and select a driver that is already uploaded.
. Different kinds of set ups can be created, depending on the operations you wish to perform.
+
* OracleEBS JMS
* OracleEBS PL-SQL
* OracleEBS Web Services
+
// image:<missing>config-select.png[Configuration selector]
+
.. For calling PL/SQL operations, create a PL/SQL Configuration:
+
// image:<missing>config-plsql.png[PL/SQL Config]
+
** Username: Username to call PL/SQL web services. Make sure it has the correct grants.
** Password: Password for the username.
** Host: Host of the Oracle EBS instance.
** Port: Port of the Oracle EBS web services.
** SSL: If enabled, will make calls using HTTPS instead of HTTP.
** Responsibility Name: The responsibility name that is needed to execute the operation.
** Responsibility Application Name: The application short name that is needed to execute the operation.
** Security Group Name: The security group key of the Oracle EBS instance (optional). Default value is STANDARD.
** NLS Language: The NLS language of the Oracle EBS instance (optional). Default value is AMERICAN.
** Org ID: The organization ID of the Oracle EBS instance (optional). Default value is 204.
+
.. If you wish to call other types of web services, create a Web Services Configuration:
+
// image:<missing>config-ws.png[Web Services Config]
+
** Username: Username to call PL/SQL web services. Make sure it has the correct grants.
** Password: Password for the username.
** Host: Host of the Oracle EBS instance.
** Port: Port of the Oracle EBS web services.
** SSL: If enabled, will make calls using HTTPS instead of HTTP.
** TrustStore file name: The custom TrustStore file for HTTPS calls (optional).
** TrustStore password: The password for the TrustStore (optional).
** Disable Common Name Checking: Disables Common Name (CN) Checking on SSL certificates (optional).
** Responsibility Name: The responsibility name that is needed to execute the operation.
** Responsibility Application Name: The application short name that is needed to execute the operation.
** Security Group Name: The security group key of the Oracle EBS instance (optional). Default value is STANDARD.
** NLS Language: The NLS language of the Oracle EBS instance (optional). Default value is AMERICAN.
** Org ID: The organization ID of the Oracle EBS instance (optional). Default value is 204.
+
.. If you intent to use the connector to subscribe to Business Events or to the XML Gateway queue, you need to create a JMS Configuration. This one supports two connection types: one where you set the DB URL as a whole, and one to define it as individual parameters.
+
** Username: Username for the Oracle EBS database.
** Password: The password for the username.
** URL: The URL of the Oracle EBS database.
** Read Receive Timeout: The timeout value (in milliseconds) - 30000 in this example.
** Username: Username for the Oracle EBS database.
** Password: The password for the username.
** Host: The host of the Oracle EBS database.
** Port: The port of the Oracle EBS database. This example uses port 1521.
** Database SID: The SID of the database.
+
. Select the plus sign to add a component.
. Select the connector as a component.
+
image::oracle/oracle-ebs-select-connector.png[Select connector as a Design Center Component]
+
. Pick an operation. For example, Get Party Site.
+
. Configure the fields:
.. Id: TCA identifier for the Party Site business object.
.. Orig Sys: Party Site original system name.
.. Orig Sys Ref: Party Site original system reference.

=== Add Libraries for this Connector

If you intent to subsribe to Business Events or to the XML Gateway queue, the JMS Configuration requires two external libraries.

. Go to the connector's JMS Configuration.
. Click Set Up under the message to setup drivers.
. Upload and select your libraries.
.. Oracle AQ API: Can be retrieved from the EBS instance, at `$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/jlib/aqapi.jar`.
.. Oracle Database JDBC Driver: Can also be found in the instance, at `$ORACLE_HOME/jdbc/lib/ojdbc6.jar`.

== Connect in Anypoint Studio 7

You can use this connector in Anypoint Studio by adding it as a dependency in your Mule application.

=== Install Connector in Studio

. Open your Mule project in Anypoint Studio.
. Add the connector as a dependency in the pom.xml file:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.mule.connectors</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-oracle-ebs-connector</artifactId>
  <version>5.0.0</version>
  <classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
</dependency>
----

=== Configure in Studio

. Drag and drop a connector's operation to the Studio Canvas.
. Configure the example Get Party Site:
.. Id: TCA identifier for the Party Site business object.
.. Orig Sys: Party Site original system name.
.. Orig Sys Ref: Party Site original system reference.

image::oracle/oracle-ebs-get-party-site-studio.png[Get Party Site operation configuration]

== Use Case: Studio

This sample flow calls an operation every 30 seconds and logs its output.

. Drag a Scheduler and set the frequency to 30 seconds.
. Select OracleEBS > Get Party Site from the Palette and drag it to the flow.
. Configure its input.
. Drag a Logger and set its message to `#[payload]`.

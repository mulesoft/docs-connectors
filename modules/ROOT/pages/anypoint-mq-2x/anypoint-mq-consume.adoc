The Consume operation in the Anypoint MQ connector provides the ability to consume a message at any time of the flow, from any destination.

== Consume A Message

The syntax to consume a message from a queue is:

[source,console]
----
<anypoint-mq:consume config-ref="MQ_config" destination="#[vars.destination]"/>
----

The operation above consumes the first available message in the queue identified by the destination, and then converts it to a `MuleMessage` resulting in the following structure:

* The message's content as payload.
* The message's metadata in the message attributes.

By default, the ACK mode is `MANUAL`, so the message isn't ACKed. If you want the message to be acknowledged as soon as it is consumed, set the mode to `IMMEDIATE`.
For more information regarding a message ACK, see xref:anypoint-mq/anypoint-mq-ack.adoc[How to Handle Message Acknowledgment].

== Wait for a Message

By default, the maximum wait time is configured in 10 seconds, producing a `null` result if no message is available in that period.
If configuring a timeout that fits better for your use case, customize the `pollingTime` parameter.

== Incoming Message Metadata

As stated before, each message received consists of two parts:

* Payload - Contains the content of a message.
* Attributes - Contains the metadata for a message.

This metadata maps all the information available in a Anypoint MQ message, including:

* Message ID
* Headers
* Properties

See xref:anypoint-mq/anypoint-mq-connector-reference.adoc#consume[Consume] for details regarding the attributes structure.

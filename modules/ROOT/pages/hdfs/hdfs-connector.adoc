Hadoop (HDFS) Connector Version 6.0

Anypoint Connector for Hadoop (HDFS) works as a bidirectional gateway between Mule applications and Apache Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). You can use the Hadoop (HDFS) Connector to poll the content of a file at a configurable rate or interval, or to manipulate data in an HDFS server.

For information about compatibility and fixed issues, see xref:release-notes::connector/hdfs-connector-release-notes-mule-4.adoc[Hadoop (HDFS) Connector Release Notes] 

== Prerequisites

To use this connector, you must be familiar with:

* Anypoint Connectors
* Mule runtime engine (Mule)
* Elements in a Mule flow
* Global elements
* How to create a Mule app using Design Center or Anypoint Studio

Before creating an app, you must have:

* Access to the Hadoop (HDFS) target resource and Anypoint Platform 
* Anypoint Studio version 7.0 or later 
* A running instance of Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)


== Audience

* New user
+
To create your Mule app, see:
** xref:hdfs/hdfs-connector-studio.adoc[Studio Configuration]
** xref:hdfs/hdfs-connector-examples.adoc[Examples], which has use cases for the connector
+
* Power user
+
Read the following topics: 
** xref:hdfs/hdfs-connector-xml-maven.adoc[XML and Maven Support]
** xref:hdfs/hdfs-connector-examples.adoc[Examples]  

== Connection Authentication Types

Hadoop (HDFS) Connector supports the following connection authentication types:

* Kerberos +
This connection type uses the Kerberos principal as the username. The keytab path you specify obtains a ticket-granting ticket (TGT) from the authorization server. 
* Simple +
This connection type passes the name of the node that contains the file system you want to connect to as the default name key.


== Next Step

After you complete the prerequisites and experiment with templates and examples, you are ready to create an app with xref:hdfs/hdfs-connector-studio.adoc[Anypoint Studio].

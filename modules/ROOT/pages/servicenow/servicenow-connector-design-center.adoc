To configure a connector in Design Center:

. Configure the trigger for the connector, which can be an HTTP Listener, or a Scheduler.
. Configure the target component for the connector.

== Configure the Trigger

You can use an HTTP Listener or Scheduler as a trigger to initiate execution of the Mule flow. When changes occur in ServiceNow, the trigger starts the Mule flow to process the change.

. From the Anypoint Platform Design Center, click *Create*, and then click *Create new application* under *Create a Mule Application*.
. Enter a project name and click *Create*.
. Exit the *Let’s Get Started* wizard by clicking *Go straight to canvas*.
. Click the plus sign.
. Select an HTTP Listener or Scheduler as the trigger.

== Configure the Target Component

In Design Center’s Flow Designer, after you specify a trigger, you can add the ServiceNow connector as a component to process the input you received from the trigger. You may also want to add a DataWeave Transform between the trigger and the component to transform the input information to what you want as input to the ServiceNow connector component.

=== Adding a ServiceNow Connector as a Component

To add a ServiceNow connecter as a component:

. After creating a trigger, click the plus sign.
. Optionally click *Transform* to use DataWeave to map fields between your received data and the data to use with your ServiceNow component.
. Select *ServiceNow Connector*, and then select an operation.
. Click *Click here to set it up*.
. Select a connection type and enter the required information:

=== Creating an HTTP Global Element for ServiceNow

To create an HTTP global element for the ServiceNow connector, enter values into these fields:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|*Protocol*| Protocol selected for the HTTP endpoint, it can be HTTP or HTTPS (secure).
|*Host*| IP address where the Mule application listens for requests.
|*Port*| Port address where the Mule application listens for requests.
|*Base Path*| Path where the Mule application listens for requests.
|===

=== Checking Your ServiceNow credentials

To check your ServiceNow credentials, do the following when you create the flow:

. Define an HTTP Request component with Basic Auth credentials.
. Add the ServiceNow Invoke operation.
. From the `Invoke` operation, configure and save a connection to the ServiceNow server.

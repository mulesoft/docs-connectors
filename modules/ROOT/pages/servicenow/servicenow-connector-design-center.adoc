Create applications using the ServiceNow connector. You can use an HTTP Listener or Scheduler as a trigger to initiate execution of the Mule flow. When changes occur in ServiceNow, the trigger starts the Mule flow to process the change. In addition, you can use a ServiceNow operation to process the changes as a component.

. From the Anypoint Platform Design Center, click *Create*, and then click *Create new application*.
. Enter a project name and click *Create*.
. Exit the *Let’s Get Started wizard* by clicking *Go straight to canvas*.
. Select a trigger, such as an HTTP Listener or Scheduler.
. Configure the selected trigger. Accept the default settings for the HTTP Listener or Scheduler and provide any required values.

== Configure a Design Center Component

In Design Center’s Flow Designer, after you specify a trigger, you can add the ServiceNow connector as a component to process the input you received from the trigger. You may also want to add a DataWeave Transform between the trigger and the component to transform the input information to what you want as input to the ServiceNow connector component. The ServiceNow connector doesn’t have to be a component, it depends on what you’re trying to accomplish with your app.

Is the above text _attributes for ServiceNow? What do you do with the connector if it isn't a component? Shouldn't we say something about that here?

To add a ServiceNow connecter as a component

. After creating a trigger, click the plus sign.
. Optionally click *Transform* to use DataWeave to map fields between your received data and the data to use with your ServiceNow component.
. Select the connector as a component.
. Select the operation.
. Configure the connector.

To check your ServiceNow credentials, do the following when you create the flow:

. Define an HTTP Request component with BASIC Auth credentials.
. Add the ServiceNow Invoke operation.
. From the Invoke operation, configure and save a connection to the ServiceNow server.

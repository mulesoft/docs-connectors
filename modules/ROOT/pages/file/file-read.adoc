= To Read a File Using the File Connector

:keywords: file, connector, read



The File connector can read a file at any point in the flow, unlike in Mule 3, where the transport can only read files as a result of inbound endpoint polling.

Here is the syntax for reading a file:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<file:read path="#[path]"
  lock="true|false"
  outputEncoding="UTF-8"
  outputMimeType="application/xml" />
----

The operation above reads the file in the given path. It returns a `MuleMessage` with the following attributes:

* The file's content as payload.
* The file's metadata in the message attributes.
* If the file does not exist, you receive a `FILE:ILLEGAL_PATH` error. Note that the operation does not read directories.

== File Locking

You can set a file system lock on the file when it is being read by setting the `lock` parameter to `true` (defaults to `false`). When enabled, this feature asks the operating system to lock the file, which prevents any other process (or Mule flow) from accessing that file while the lock is held. The lock is automatically released when one of the following things occurs:

* The Mule flow, which locked the file, ends.
* The file content has been fully read.

Note that if the file is already locked by someone else, the connector will not be able to lock it, and you will receive a `FILE:FILE_LOCK` error.

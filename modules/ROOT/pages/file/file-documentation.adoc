File Connector v1.3

The File connector manipulates file systems mounted on a host operation system.

This class serves as both extension definition and configuration. Operations are based on the standard BaseFileSystemOperations

== Configurations

[[config]]
=== Config

+++
Default configuration
+++

==== Parameters
[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%,.^20%,^.^5%", options="header"]

==== Connection Types
[[config_connection]]
===== Local FileSystem Connection

+++
A ConnectionProvider which provides instances of FileSystem from instances of FileConnector.

== Operations

[[copy]]
=== Copy

`<file:copy>`

Copies the file at the sourcePath into the targetPath.

If targetPath doesn't exist, and neither does its parent, then an attempt is made to create depending on the value of the createParentFolder argument. If such an argument occurs, then a FILE:ILLEGAL_PATH is thrown.

If the target file already exists, it's overwritten if the *Overwrite* argument is true. Otherwise, the FILE:FILE_ALREADY_EXISTS error is thrown. 

The sourcePath can either be a file or a directory. If it points to a directory, then it's copied recursively.

[[move]]
=== Move

`<file:move>`

Moves the file at the sourcePath into the targetPath.

If targetPath doesn't exist, and neither does its parent, then an attempt is made to create depending on the value of the createParentFolder argument. If such an argument occurs, then a FILE:ILLEGAL_PATH is thrown. 

If the target file already exists, it's overwritten if the *Overwrite* argument is true. Otherwise, FILE:FILE_ALREADY_EXISTS error is thrown.

The sourcePath can either be a file or a directory. If it points to a directory, then it's moved recursively.

* FILE:RETRY_EXHAUSTED {nbsp}


[[read]]
=== Read

`<file:read>`

Obtains the content and metadata of a file at a given path. The operation itself returns a Message which payload is a InputStream with the file's content, and the metadata is represent as a LocalFileAttributes object that's placed as the message `Message#getAttributes()` attributes. 

If the lock parameter is set to true, then a file system level lock is placed on the file until the input stream this operation returns is closed or fully consumed. Because the lock is actually provided by the host file system, its behavior might change depending on the mounted drive and the operation system on which Mule is running. Take that into consideration before blindly relying on this lock.

This method also makes a best effort to determine the MIME type of the file being read. The file's extension is used to make an educated guess on the file's MIME type. The user also has the chance to force the output encoding and `mimeType` through the `outputEncoding` and `outputMimeType` optional parameters.

[[rename]]
=== Rename

`<file:rename>`


Renames the file pointed by the path to the name provided on the `to` parameter. The `to` argument should not contain any path separator. FILE:ILLEGAL_PATH is thrown if this precondition is not honored.

[[write]]
=== Write

`<file:write>`


Writes the content into the file pointed by path.

If the directory on which the file is attempting to be written doesn't exist, then the operation will either throw FILE:ILLEGAL_PATH error or create such folder depending on the value of the createParentDirectory.

If the file itself already exists, then the behavior depends on the supplied mode. 

This operation also supports locking support depending on the value of the lock argument, but following the same rules and considerations as described in the read operation.

[[listener]]
=== On New or Updated File

`<file:listener>`

Polls a directory looking for files that have been created or updated. One message is generated for each file that is found. 

The key part of this functionality is how to determine that a file is actually new. 

These are the strategies for that:

* Set the `autoDelete` parameter to `true`: This deletes each processed file after it has been processed, causing all files obtained in the next poll to be necessarily new.
* Set `moveToDirectory` parameter: This moves each processed file to a different directory after it has been processed, achieving the same effect as `autoDelete<` but without loosing the file.
* Use the watermarkMode parameter to only pick files that have been created/updated after the last poll was executed. 

A matcher can also be used for additional filtering of files.

=== Time Between Size Check Parameter Behavior

This wait is performed at the moment of retrieving the content of the file.
If the flow never accesses the content of the file, the check will not be done. Also,
because this wait can take place in multiple message processors, this connector has no
control over which thread will be the one performing the wait, thus leaving the possibility
open to block threads not meant for this type of behavior.

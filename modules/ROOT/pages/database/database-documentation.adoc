[[storedProcedure]]
=== Stored Procedure

Invokes a Stored Procedure on the database.  When the stored procedure returns one or more ResultSet instances, streaming is automatically applied to avoid preemptive consumption of such results, which may lead to performance and memory issues.

== Sources

[[listener]]
=== On Table Row
`<db:listener>`


Selects from a table at a regular interval and generates one message per each obtained row.  Optionally, watermark and id columns can be provided. If a watermark column is provided, the values taken from that column will be used to filter the contents of the next poll, so that only rows with a greater watermark value are returned. If an id column is provided, this component will automatically make sure that the same row is not picked twice by concurrent polls

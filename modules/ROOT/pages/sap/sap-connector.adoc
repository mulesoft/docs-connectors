SAP Connector v5.1

Anypoint Connector for SAP (SAP Connector) enables the integration of data to and from external systems based on SAP NetWeaver.

SAP Connector is not available in the Design Center feature of Anypoint Platform.

This connector requires a separate license. Contact MuleSoft to evaluate or use this connector in production.

Mule runtime engine (Mule) supports SAP integration through Anypoint Connector for SAP, an SAP-certified Java connector that leverages the SAP Java Connector (JCo) libraries. SAP JCo facilitates communication between an SAP backend system and a Java application. It allows Java programs to connect to SAP systems and invoke Remote Function Modules. It also allows parsing of IDocs (SAP Intermediate Documents), among other object types. The SAP configuration supports both inbound and outbound communications. 

The SAP JCo libraries enable Mule apps to:

* Execute BAPI functions over the following types of RFC protocols:
** Synchronous Remote Function Call RFC (sRFC)
** Asynchronous Remote Function Call RFC (aRFC)
* Act as a JCo server to be called as a BAPI over sRFC and aRFC
* Send IDocs over tRFC and qRFC
* Receive IDocs over tRFC and qRFC
* Transform SAP objects (JCo function for BAPI and IDocs) to and from XML

See <<SAP Terminology>> to understand SAP acronyms.


== About Connectors

Anypoint Connectors are Mule runtime engine extensions that enable you to connect to APIs 
and resources on external systems, such as Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, and Twitter.

== Prerequisites

To use this information, you should have:

* A working knowledge of the SAP business context and, in particular, the SAP R/3 Business Suite
* A basic understanding of the SAP NetWeaver Platform from an administration point of view.
* Knowledge of the ABAP language
* An SAP ID to download the required SAP libraries
* SAP login credentials to test your connection to your target resource
* Use of the RFC protocol to connect to NetWeaver Application Servers (NWAS) + 
http://www.cipherbsc.com/solutions/sap-erp-central-component-erp-ecc/[ECC] and https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/SAP_CUSTOMER_RELATIONSHIP_MANAGEMENT[CRM] run on top of NWAS, as other SAP solutions do, so any customer using the connector can access those systems.
* Knowledge of how to create a Mule app using Anypoint Studio

Before creating an app:

. You must have access to the SAP target resource and Anypoint Platform. 
. Browse to the SAP web site and download the version 3.0.18 libraries
for IDoc, JCO, and JCO Native to a folder on your computer. +
The library formats are usable by Studio 7 directly without conversion. 

== Audience

* Starting user +
Configure your Mule app in 
xref:sap/sap-connector-studio.adoc[Anypoint Studio]. The xref:sap/sap-connector-config-topics.adoc[Additional Configuration Information] topic helps you extend your understanding of the SAP Connector.
* Power user +
Read the xref:sap/sap-connector-xml-maven.adoc[XML and Maven Support], 
xref:sap/sap-connector-config-topics.adoc[Additional Configuration Information], 
and xref:sap/sap-connector-examples.adoc[Examples] topics.

== SAP Terminology

ABAP (Advanced Business Application Programming)::
SAP proprietary programming language and part of the NetWeaver platform for building business applications.

ALE (Application Link Enabling)::
Sets up distributed applications and integrated installation of SAP systems. This involves business-driven message exchange using consistent data across loosely linked SAP apps. Apps are integrated through synchronous and asynchronous communication, rather than by use of a central database.

BAPI (Business Application Programming Interface)::
The function module that fulfills design criteria, such as:
** Implement a method of a SAP business object.
** Maintain a static interface through different versions of the SAP system.
** Enable remotely.
** Run to completion with or without user interaction.
** Handle errors.

FM (function module)::
Procedures defined in the ABAP language of SAP that allow the encapsulation and reuse of global functions in SAP.

IDoc (intermediate document)::
Standard SAP format for electronic data interchange between SAP systems. Different message types (such as delivery notes or purchase orders) generally correspond to different special formats, known as IDoc types. Multiple message types with related content can, however, be assigned to a single IDoc type.

Java API::
Handles dynamic metadata lookup and caching. The Java API implements the `JCO.Function` container used for parameters and/or tables for the SAP BAPI function module in Java. Java apps are built on top of the Java API.

JNI (Java Native Interface)::
JNI is a layer in the SAP Connector library. JCo wraps the C libraries in Java to provide platform-native access into the SAP system. RFC middleware uses the RFC library through the JNI Layer.

RFC (remote function call)::
Communication with the SAP system is performed over the RFC protocol. RFC means calling BAPI or triggering IDoc processing that runs in another system as a calling program. The RFC interface enables function calls between two SAP systems or between the SAP and external system.

RFC Layer::
SAP component that processes remote function calls.

RFC Library::
Libraries of C language-based functions to access the SAP system. The RFC library is addressed by JNI.

SAP Java IDoc class library::
Provides structured, high-level interpretation and navigation of SAP IDocs in Java that consists of the following add-on packages:
** SAP Java base IDoc class library: a middleware-independent library that provides a set of general base classes and interfaces for middleware dependent Java IDoc class library implementations.
** SAP Java connector IDoc class library: A middleware-independent library for creating, sending, and receiving IDocs.

SAP NetWeaver::
One of the main technologies and application platforms used by SAP solutions. The main component of NetWeaver is the SAP Web Application Server (WebAS), which provides the runtime environment for SAP applications like ERP, CRM, SCM, PLM, SRM, and BI. Other components include the enterprise portal, exchange infrastructure, master data management, and mobile infrastructure. The SAP NetWeaver is an umbrella term for these technical components. SAP NetWeaver runs on both the Java and ABAP stacks.

SNC (Secure Network Communications)::
SNC integrates with the SAP NetWeaver single sign-on, or an external security product that works with SAP systems. SNC provides security functions that are not directly available with SAP systems.
+
NOTE: SNC is not supported for use in apps that deploy SAP Connector in Runtime Manager (CloudHub).

== Exchange Templates and Examples

https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Anypoint Exchange] provides templates and examples 
to simplify your use of the SAP connector. Templates provide a starting point 
that enables you to add additional functionality. Examples provide a complete solution.

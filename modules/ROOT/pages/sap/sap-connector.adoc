SAP Connector v4.1 and v4.2

The SAP connector enables the integration of data to and from SAP NetWeaver-based and external systems.

Note: This connector is only available in Mule 4 and Studio 7, and is not available in the Design Center feature of Anypoint Platform.

This connector requires a separate license. Contact MuleSoft to evaluate or use this connector in production.

Mule runtime supports SAP integration through our Anypoint Connector for SAP, an SAP-certified Java connector that leverages the SAP Java Connector (JCo) libraries, thus allowing Mule applications to:

* Execute BAPI functions over the RFC protocol, supporting the following types:
** Synchronous RFC (sRFC)
** Transactional RFC (tRFC)
** Queued RFC (qRFC)
* Act as a JCo Server to be called as a BAPI over sRFC, tRFC, and qRFC.
* Send IDocs over tRFC and qRFC.
* Receive IDocs over tRFC and qRFC.
* Transform SAP objects (JCo Function/BAPI & IDocs) to and from XML.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes you have:

* A working knowledge of the SAP business context and in particular, the SAP R/3 Business Suite.
* A basic understanding of the SAP NetWeaver Platform from an administration point of view.
* Knowledge of the ABAP language.
* Login credentials to test your connection to your target resource.

For hardware and software requirements and compatibility information, see the 
xref:release-notes::connector/sap-connector-release-notes-mule-4.adoc[SAP Connector Release Notes].

== Configure Studio for the Connector

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio task bar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange and supply your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. Search for the SAP connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

== Create a Global Element in Studio

If needed, you can create a global SAP element if you need more than one SAP connector instance in your Mule project.

The SAP connector object holds the configuration properties that allow you to connect to the SAP server.

To create a configuration for an SAP connector, complete the following steps:

. Go to Global Elements section, and click Create.
. Select either SAP Inbound or SAP Outbound in the Connector Configuration section
. In the General tab pane, enter the required parameters for defining an SAP connection, which your SAP system administrator should supply.

The SAP Global Element Configuration allows you to define connection properties as well as to easily add the required SAP dependencies to your project.

For ease of use, the SAP connector only shows the most common properties as connector parameters. To configure a property that is not listed in the Properties panel, consult the "Extended Properties" section in this guide.

The minimum required attributes to define are:

[[gepparms]]
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|Application Server Host | SAP endpoint
|Username | Username of an authorized SAP user.
|Password | Password credential of an authorized SAP user.
|System Number | System number used to connect to the SAP system.
|Client| The SAP client ID (usually a number) used to connect to the SAP system.
|Login Language | The language to use for the SAP connection. For example, EN for English.
|===

As a best practice, use property placeholder syntax to load the credentials in a more simple and reusable way.

Click the Test button to verify that the connection to the SAP instance succeeded. If the credentials are correct you should receive a Test Connection Successful message.

== Install SAP Libraries

. Browse to the SAP web site and download the version 3.0.18 libraries
for IDOC, JCO, and JCO Native. The library formats are usable by
Studio 7 directly without conversion. You can download them to
a folder on your computer. You must have a SAP ID to download the libraries.
+
*Note:* The file types for each library depend on your operating system:
+
** Windows: sapidoc3.jar, sapjco3.jar, sapjco3.dll
** Mac OS:  sapidoc3.jar, sapjco3.jar, libsapjco3.jnilib
** Linux:   sapidoc3.jar, sapjco3.jar, libsapjco3.so
+
. After installing the SAP connector in Studio and adding the connector to your Mule
project, double click the connector in the flow, and click the plus (*+*) sign
to the right of the Connector Configuration field.
+
This screen appears:
+

|Log trace flag |logTraceFlag |Indicates if the trace should be logged on the Mule server. |false
|Use SAP default format |useSAPFormat |Indicates to use SAP default format when working with BAPI functions over sRFC. |false
|Operation timeout |operationTimeout |Timeout for operations.  A positive value in milliseconds. A value of 0 means indefinite waiting. | 0
|===

== Use Case: Function Source - Return Values to SAP

Create a Mule application that receives a function using the SAP connector's *Function source* operation. The *Function source* operation passes the export parameter back to SAP.

. Create a new *Mule Project* in Anypoint Studio.
. Add the SAP connector to your project.
. Drag the SAP connector's *Function source* operation to the flow.
. Create a new *SAP Inbound* global element configuration and fill with environment values.
. Add a transform message component to the flow and fill the details based on metadata.
+
Example:
+
image::sap/sap-function-return-response.png[]
+
The flow should look like this:
+
image::sap/sap-flow-response.png[]
+
In the SAP Studio interface, you should see:
+
image::sap/sap-result-sap-gui.png[]

=== Send IDoc to SAP

To create a Mule application to send an IDoc to SAP:

. Create a new Mule Project in Anypoint Studio.
. Create a new HTTP Listener global element configuration and leave it with the default values.
. Drag an HTTP Request connector onto the canvas and configure the following parameters:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Parameter |Value
|Connector Configuration | `HTTP_Listener_Configuration`
|Path |`/sendIDoc`
|===
+
. Create a new SAP Outbound global element configuration and fill with environment values.
. Click Test to confirm that Mule can connect with the SAP instance. If the connection is successful, click OK to save the configuration. Otherwise, review or correct any invalid parameters and test again.
. Select the SAP module and add Send IDoc operation next to the HTTP and in the Extension Configuration field select the configuration created in the previous section.
. Configure the operation with the following values:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Parameter|Value
|Display Name |Send IDoc (or any other name you prefer).
|Connector configuration |`SAP_Outbound` - The name of the global element you created.
|Key |MATMAS01
|Content |`#[payload]`
|===
+
. Drag a Transform Message component before the SAP connector, and click the component to open its properties editor. Once metadata has been retrieved, select the respective fields to populate for the Employee. The Transform script should look like:
+
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/xml
---
read('<?xml version="1.0"?>
<MATMAS01>
    <IDOC BEGIN="1">

        </EDI_DC40>
    </IDOC>
</MATMAS01>
',"application/xml")
----
+
. Add a Logger right after the SAP endpoint to see the connector payload in the logs.
. Save and Run as a Mule Application.
. From a web browser, test the application by entering an employee's internal Id, first name, and last name in the form of the following query parameters:
+
[source]
----
http://localhost:8081/sendIDoc
----
+
Mule conducts the query and adds the employee record.

=== SAP JCo Notes

SAP JCo facilitates communication between an SAP backend system and a Java application. SAP JCo allows Java programs to connect to SAP systems and invoke Remote Function Modules. SAP JCo also allows parsing of IDocs (SAP Intermediate Documents), among other object types. Both inbound and outbound communications are supported.

* Java API: Handles dynamic metadata lookup and caching. It implements JCO.Function, which is the container for parameters and/or tables for the SAP Function Module (BAPI) in Java. Java applications are built on top of the Java API.

* JNI (Java Native Interface): Originally, SAP created libraries in C language to allow direct RFC calls to SAP, to manipulate with data. JCo wraps C libraries in Java to provide platform-native access into the SAP system. RFC Middleware uses RFC Library through (JNI) Layer.

* RFC (Remote Function Call): Communication with the SAP system is performed over the RFC protocol. RFC means calling BAPI or triggering IDoc processing that runs in another system as calling program. The RFC interface enables function calls between two SAP systems or between the SAP and external system.

* RFC Library: Libraries of C language-based functions to access the SAP system. RFC library is addressed by JNI.

* RFC Layer: SAP component that processes RFC calls.

* SAP Java IDoc Class Library: Provides structured, high-level interpretation and navigation of SAP IDocs in Java. It consists of the following add-on packages:
** SAP Java Base IDoc Class Library: a middleware-independent library that provides a set of general base classes and interfaces for middleware dependent Java IDoc Class Library implementations.
** SAP Java Connector IDoc Class Library: A middleware-independent library for creating, sending, and receiving IDocs.

* FM (Function Module): Function modules are procedures that are defined in the ABAP language of SAP. It allows the encapsulation and reuse of global functions in the SAP System.

* BAPI (Business Application Programming Interface): The Function Module that fulfills certain design criteria, such as:
** Implements a method of a SAP Business Object.
** Maintains a static interface through different versions of the SAP system.
** Is remote-enabled.
** Runs to completion with or without user interaction.
** Handles errors.

* IDoc (Intermediate Document): Standard SAP format for electronic data interchange between SAP systems. Different messages types (such as delivery notes or purchase orders) generally correspond to different special formats, known as IDoc types. Multiple message types with related content can, however, be assigned to a single IDoc type.

* ALE (Application Link Enabling): Technology for setting up and operating distributed applications. ALE facilitates distributed, yet integrated, installation of SAP systems. This involves business-driven message exchange using consistent data across loosely linked SAP applications. Applications are integrated through synchronous and asynchronous communication, rather than by use of a central database.

* SAP NetWeaver: One of the main technologies and application platforms used by SAP solutions. Its main component is the SAP Web Application Server (WebAS), which provides the runtime environment for SAP applications like ERP, CRM, SCM, PLM, SRM, BI. Other components include enterprise portal, exchange infrastructure, master data management and mobile infrastructure. The SAP NetWeaver is an umbrella term for these technical components.

* SAP NetWeaver runs on both Java and ABAP stacks.

* ABAP (Advanced Business Application Programming): SAP's proprietary programming language and part of the NetWeaver platform for building business applications.

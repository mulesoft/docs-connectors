[[executeQueuedRemoteFunctionCall]]
== Execute BAPI / Function over qRFC

`<sap:execute-queued-remote-function-call>`

Executes a BAPIFunction over an Queued Remote Function Call (qRFC). A queued RFC is an extension of tRFC. It also ensures that individual steps are processed in sequence. To guarantee that multiple LUWs (Logical Unit of Work or Transaction) are processed in the order specified by the application.

tRFC can be serialized using queues (inbound and outbound queues). Hence the name queued RFC (qRFC).

qRFC is best used for: Extension of the Transactional RFC, defined processing sequence, and  Implementation of qRFC. The latter is recommended if you want to guarantee that several transactions are processed in a predefined order.

=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Configuration | String | The name of the configuration to use. | |x

[[executeSynchronousRemoteFunctionCall]]
== Execute BAPI / Function over sRFC
`<sap:execute-synchronous-remote-function-call>`


Executes a BAPIFunction over a Synchronous Remote Function Call (sRFC). A synchronous RFC requires both the systems (client and server) to be available at the time of communication or data transfer. It is the most common type and is required when result is required immediately after the execution of sRFC.

sRFC is a means of communication between systems where acknowledgements are required. The resources of the Source System wait at the target system and ensure that they deliver the message/data with ACKD. The Data is consistent and reliable for communication.  The issue is if the target system is not available, the source system resources wait until target system is available. This may lead to the Processes of source system to go into Sleep/RFC/CPIC Mode at target systems and hence blocks these resources.

sRFC is best used for: Communication between systems, communication between SAP, and Web Application Server to SAP GUI.

[[executeTransactionalRemoteFunctionCall]]
== Execute BAPI and Function over tRFC

`<sap:execute-transactional-remote-function-call>`

Executes a BAPIFunction over a Transactional Remote Function Call (tRFC). A tRFC is a special form of asynchronous Remote Function Call (aRFC). Transactional RFC ensures transaction-like handling of processing steps that were originally autonomous.

tRFC is an asynchronous communication method that executes the called function module in the RFC server only once, even if the data is sent multiple times due to some network issue. The remote system need not be available at the time when the RFC client program is executing a tRFC.

The tRFC component stores the called RFC function, together with the corresponding data, in the SAP database under a unique transaction ID (TID). tRFC is similar to aRFC as it does not wait at the target system (Similar to a registered post). If the system is not available, it will write the Data into aRFC Tables with a transaction ID (SM58) which is picked by the scheduler RSARFCSE (which runs for every 60 seconds).

tRFC is best used for: Extension of Asynchronous RFC, and for secure communication between systems.

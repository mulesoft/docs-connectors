== Default Configuration

=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | |x
| Connection a| OAuth Username Password
 | The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | |x
| Expiration Policy a| ExpirationPolicy |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform expires the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime actually purges the instances when it sees fit. |  |

| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | The number of instances to initially allow in memory to enable the connector to consume the stream and provide random access to its data. If the stream contains more data than can fit in this buffer, the buffer expands according to the bufferSizeIncrement attribute, with an upper limit of maxInMemorySize. Default value is 100 instances.|  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | A numeric increment value by how much the buffer can expand beyond its initial size. To indicate no buffer expansion, set to zero or a negative number. If the buffer is set for no expansion and gets full, any attempts to write to the buffer causes the STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error. Default value is 100 instances. |  |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | The maximum amount of memory to use. If more memory is used, write attempts causes the STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error. To set no limit, set this value to zero or a negative number. |  |

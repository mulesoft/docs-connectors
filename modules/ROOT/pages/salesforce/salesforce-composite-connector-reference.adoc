| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name of this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x
| Connection a| <<composite-config_oauth-user-pass, OAuth Username Password>>
| The connection types to provide to this configuration. | | x
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform expires the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime purges the instances when it sees fit. |  |

| Host a| String |  Hostname of the proxy. If this property is not set, then no proxy is used, otherwise a proxy is used, but a proxy host must be specified. |  | 
| Port a| Number |  Port of the proxy. If host is set then this property must be set and cannot be a negative number. |  |

Default value is 100 instances. |  | 
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This is by how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer should not expand, and that a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised when the buffer gets full. Default value is 100 instances. |  | 
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | The maximum amount of memory to use. If more than that is used then a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised. A value lower than or equal to zero means no limit. |  |

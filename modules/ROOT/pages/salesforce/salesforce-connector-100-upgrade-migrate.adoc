Upgrade Anypoint Connector for Salesforce (Salesforce Connector) to version 10.0.0.

== Supported Upgrade Paths

[%header,cols="50a,50a"]
|===
|From Version | To Version
|9.8.x |10.0.0
|===

== Changes in This Release

This release contains the following changes:

* Removed deprecated connection types
* Made the following changes to some operations:
 ** Merged multiple operations into one
 ** Renamed some operations and parameters
 ** Changed some operation return types
* Redesigned the Replay ID functionality
* Changed the Mule TLS Context usage
* Improved the error types
* Removed the dependency on the Dozer library
* Removed the keep alive feature as a configurable option. The connector now automatically performs one API call every
14 minutes (Salesforce minimum TTL is 15 minutes), so the session no longer expires.

=== Changes in Connection Types

This release contains the following changes to connection types:

* Removed the following connection types:
** Username Password
** Basic Username Password
* Added connection pool functionality to improve multi-threading support. With this functionality, each request sent to the API has its own headers and read timeout, which prevents the operation headers from being overridden with the wrong values when operations are executed simultaneously.
* Added a new *Security* tab for configuring TLS.
* Reordered the parameters in a more intuitive way.
* Moved the `Read timeout` parameter from the provider configuration to the connector configuration.
* Removed the following parameters from the connector configuration:
** `Advanced reconnection params`
** `Allow field truncation support`
** `Assignment rule id`
** `Batch Sobject max depth`
** `Can clear fields by updating field value to null`
** `Client id`
** `Disable session invalidation`
** `Time object store`
** `Use default rule`

== Changed Operations, Parameters, and Return Types

In Salesforce 10.0, all operations contain the following new parameters:

* `Time unit`
* `Read timeout`

== Upgrade Prerequisites

Before you perform the upgrade, you must:

. Create a backup of your files, data, and configuration in case you need to restore to the previous version.
. Install Salesforce Connector v10.0 to replace the Salesforce operations that were previously included in Salesforce Connector v9.8.x.

== Upgrade Steps

Follow these steps to perform the upgrade from Salesforce Connector v9.8.x to Salesforce Connector v10.0:

. In Anypoint Studio, create a Mule project.
. In the Mule Palette view, click *Search in Exchange*.
. In the *Add Dependencies to Project* window, enter `Salesforce 10` in the search field.
. In the *Available modules* section, select *Salesforce Connector 10.0.0* and click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.
. Verify that the `salesforce-connector` dependency version is `10.0.0` in the `pom.xml`.

Studio upgrades the connector automatically.


== Verify the Upgrade

After you install the latest version of the connector, follow these steps to verify the upgrade:

. In Studio, verify that there are no errors in the *Problems* or *Console* views.
. Check the project `pom.xml` and verify that there are no problems.
. Test the connection and verify that the operations work.

== Troubleshooting

If there are problems with caching the parameters and caching the metadata, try restarting Studio.

== Revert the Upgrade

If it is necessary to revert to the previous version of Salesforce Connector, change the `salesforce-connector` dependency version `10.0.0` in the project's `pom.xml` to the previous version.

You must update the project's `pom.xml` in Anypoint Studio.

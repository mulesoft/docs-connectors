[[create]]
=== Create
`+<http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/salesforce:create>+`

+++
Adds one or more new records to your organization's data.
IMPORTANT: When you map your objects to the input of this message processor keep in mind that they need to match the expected type of the object at Salesforce.
Take the CloseDate of an Opportunity as an example, if you set that field to a string of value "2019-12-13" it will be sent to Salesforce as a string and operation will be
rejected on the basis that CloseDate is not of the expected type.
The proper way to actually map it is to generate a Java Date object, you can do so using Groovy expression evaluator as `#[groovy:Date.parse("yyyy-MM-dd",
"2019-12-13")]`.

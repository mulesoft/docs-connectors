== Create

`<salesforce:create>`


Adds one or more new records to your organization's data.

The proper way to actually map it is to generate a Java Date object, you can do so using Groovy expression evaluator as `#[groovy:Date. parse("yyyy-MM-dd", "2019-12-13")]`.

| Contact Id a| String | ID of the Contact into which the lead will be merged (this contact must be associated with the specified accountId, and an accountId must be specified). Required only when updating an existing contact. 

IMPORTANT: If you are converting a lead into a person account, do not specify the contactId or an error will result. Specify only the accountId of the person account. If no contactID is specified, then the API creates a new contact that is implicitly associated with the Account. 

To create a new contact, the client
application must be logged in with sufficient access rights. To merge a lead into an existing contact, the client application must be logged in with read/write access to the
specified contact. The contact name and other existing data are not overwritten (unless overwriteLeadSource is set to true, in which case only the LeadSource field is
overwritten). For information on IDs, see ID Field Type. |  | 
| Account Id a| String | ID of the Account into which the lead will be merged. Required only when updating an existing account, including person accounts. If no accountID is specified, then the API
 creates a new account. To create a new account, the client application must be logged in with sufficient access rights. To merge a lead into an existing account, the client
 application must be logged in with read/write access to the specified account. The account name and other existing data are not overwritten. For information on IDs, see ID
 Field Type. |  | 
| Send Email To Owner a| Boolean | Specifies whether to send a notification email to the owner specified in the ownerId (true) or not (false, the default). | false | 
| Opportunity Name a| String | Name of the opportunity to create. If no name is specified, then this value defaults to the company name of the lead. The maximum length of this field is 80 characters. If
 doNotCreateOpportunity argument is true, then no Opportunity is created and this field must be left blank; otherwise, an error is returned. |  | 
| Do Not Create Opportunity a| Boolean | Specifies whether to create an Opportunity during lead conversion (false, the default) or not (true). Set this flag to true only if you do not want to create an opportunity
 from the lead. An opportunity is created by default. | false | 
| Over Write Lead Source a| Boolean | Specifies whether to overwrite the LeadSource field on the target Contact object with the contents of the LeadSource field in the source Lead object (true), or not (false,
 the default). To set this field to true, the client application must specify a contactId for the target contact. | false | 
| Opportunity Id a| String | The ID of an existing opportunity to relate to a lead during lead conversion. |  |

Support Category: Select

The Anypoint Salesforce Connector lets you connect to the Salesforce APIs. This connector exposes methods for accessing Salesforce, including working with the https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_dev_process_chapter.htm[Salesforce Apex classes].

This connector works with the Salesforce SOAP API, REST API, Bulk API, and Streaming API, depending on the operation you configure. Each API call uses an XML request and response over an HTTPS connection. All required request headers, error handling, and HTTPS connection configurations are built into the connector.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Salesforce, HTTP, SOAP, REST, Bulk and Streaming APIs, Mule runtime engine (Mule), Anypoint Connectors, Anypoint Studio (Studio), Mule concepts, elements in a Mule flow, and Global Elements.

Requirements for using the connector:

* https://developer.salesforce.com[Salesforce developer account].
* https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=user_security_token.htm[Salesforce security token] - You can receive a new security token by email if you run *Reset Security Token* through *My Personal Information* from the Salesforce Setup pages.
* Consumer key and Secret (available in your Salesforce developer account) - Required if you are using the OAuth API.
* Namespace and schema location: If you plan to create the XML for your Mule app, you need to include the correct namespace and schema location in your XML file. Anypoint Studio adds this information to the XML file automatically when you add the Salesforce connector to a flow in a Mule app.

[NOTE]
====

* The Salesforce connector does not expose all possible operations of the Salesforce APIs.
* The Salesforce connector does not provide access to the Chatter REST API or the Tooling API.
* See http://blogs.developerforce.com/tech-pubs/2011/10/salesforce-apis-what-they-are-when-to-use-them.html[Salesforce APIs: What they are and when to use them] and https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=integrate_what_is_api.htm[Which API should I use?].

== Develop an App

Build an app in this order:

. Configure the connector.
. Test the connection.
. Build the rest of your flow.
. Add and configure DataWeave.

When developing an app, the Salesforce connector provides these integration patterns
you can use with the Salesforce APIs:

* Batch Data Synchronization - An external system accesses, changes, deletes, or adds data in Salesforce in batches, and vice versa (Salesforce to external system).
* Remote Call-In - An external system accesses, changes, deletes or adds data in Salesforce, and vice versa (Salesforce to external system).
* Fire and Forget Remote Process Invocation - Salesforce initiates a process in a third-party system and receives an acknowledgment that the process has started. The third-party system continues processing independent of Salesforce.
* Request-Reply Remote Process Invocation - Salesforce kicks off a process in a remote system, waits for the remote system to finish processing, then accepts control back again from the remote system.
* User Interface Update Based on Data Changes - The Salesforce UI updates in response to a change in a third-party system.

The Salesforce connector works with the following APIs.

=== Apex SOAP API

The Salesforce https://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/apexcode/[Apex SOAP API] exposes Apex class methods as custom SOAP Web service calls. This allows an external app to invoke an Apex Web service to perform an action in Salesforce.

=== SOAP API

The Salesforce http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api/index.htm[SOAP API] provides secure access to your organization's information on Salesforce. Most of the operations that the Salesforce connector performs map to this API.

All Salesforce operations performed through the SOAP API have an optional parameter called `Headers` that can take any of the following https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/soap_headers.htm[Salesforce SOAP Headers]:
`AllOrNoneHeader`, `AllowFieldTruncationHeader`, `AssignmentRuleHeader`, `CallOptions`,
`EmailHeader`, `LocaleOptions`, `MruHeader`, `OwnerChangeOptions`, `QueryOptions`,
`UserTerritoryDeleteHeader`, `DuplicateRuleHeader`.

=== Apex REST API

The Salesforce https://developer.salesforce.com/page/Creating_REST_APIs_using_Apex_REST[Apex REST API] creates your own REST-based web services using Apex. The Apex REST API provides all the advantages of REST architecture, the ability to define custom logic, and automatic argument and object mapping.

=== Bulk API

The Salesforce https://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api_asynch/[Bulk API] quickly and securely load batches of your organization's data into Salesforce. See <<Load Data in Batches>>.

=== Streaming API

The Salesforce http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api_streaming/[Streaming API] securely receives notifications for changes to your organization's information in Salesforce. See <<Receive Inbound Data From Salesforce>> for more information on the use of the Streaming API.

=== Metadata API

The Salesforce http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api_meta/[Metadata API] manages customizations and build tools that work with the metadata model, not the data itself.

== Configure in Design Center

. From the Anypoint Platform Design Center, click *Create*, and then click *Create new application* under *Create a Mule Application*.
. Provide a project name and click *Create*.
. Exit the *Let's Get Started* wizard by clicking *Go straight to canvas*.
. For the trigger, if you want a Salesforce event to initiate access to your app (that is, to trigger your app), choose one of the Salesforce operations. Alternatively, you can use an *HTTP Listener* or *Scheduler* trigger.
+
Salesforce trigger operations:
+
* *On Deleted Object* - Initiate your app when a Salesforce user deletes an object. Possible object types are `Contact`, `Lead`, `Account`, `Contracts`, `Opportunity`, or the name of a custom object.
* *On Modified Object* - Initiate your app when a Salesforce user modifies an object. Possible object types are `Contact`, `Lead`, `Account`, `Contracts`, `Opportunity`, or the name of a custom object.
* *On New Object* - Initiate your app when a Salesforce user creates a new object. Possible object types are `Contact`, `Lead`, `Account`, `Contracts`, `Opportunity`, or the name of a custom object. 
* *Replay Channel* - Subscribe to a streaming channel. This trigger provides channel-related notification settings for new events and events stored by Salesforce within the 24-hour retention period. Events that take place in the specified channel trigger the flow.
+
NOTE: Before you can subscribe to a channel or topic, it must first be published to Salesforce.
+
* *Replay Topic* - Subscribe to a topic. This trigger provides topic-related notification settings for new events and events stored by Salesforce within the 24-hour retention period. Events that take place on records in the specified topic trigger the flow.
* *Subscribe Channel* - Subscribe to a streaming channel. This trigger provides channel-related notification settings for new events that take place after you subscribe.
* *Subscribe Topic* - Subscribe to a topic. This trigger provides topic-related notification settings for new events that take place after you subscribe.

IMPORTANT: For the *On New Object* and *On Modified Object* operations, specify a UTC value in the *Since* field. If the server is in a different time zone, you must specify a value for the *Since* field; if the *Since* field is left empty, the connector takes the local timestamp. Servers in datacenters are often located elsewhere, in a different time zone, so specifying a UTC value in the *Since* field is recommended.

== Configure a Salesforce New Object Trigger

. Create a new Mule application in Design Center.
. Set the trigger. For example, you can use Salesforce > *On New Object*.
. Specify an object. Possible object types are `Contact`, `Lead`, `Account`, `Contracts`, `Opportunity`, or the name of a custom object.
. (Optional) Set *Since* value for the range of information you want.
. Click *Click here to set it up*.
. Specify the Connection Type:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Connection Type |Salesforce Information Site
| <<Configure Basic Username Password Authorization, Basic Username Password>> |https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_calls_login.htm[SOAP API Username Password Login]
| <<Configure OAuth JWT Authorization, OAuth JWT>> |https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=remoteaccess_oauth_jwt_flow.htm[OAuth 2.0 JWT Bearer Token Flow]

|===
+
. Specify the parameters as required for each configuration type, and click *Test* to ensure you have a valid connection to Salesforce.
. If needed, configure the *Apex* tab to decide what metadata to fetch and to add Apex class names.
. If you haven't specified a `Connection Type`, and if needed, configure the *Advanced* tab to set the `Max Idle Time` and `Time Units` for how long to hold open a connection before it expires.
. After you specify a connection type, if needed, you can use the *Advanced* tab to change values for the Reconnection Strategy, Pooling Profile, and Expiration Policy.
. If needed, set the `Redelivery Policy` on the main configuration screen. This indicates the maximum number of tries to deliver trigger content.

=== Configure Salesforce as a Component

After creating a trigger, click the plus sign. If needed, click *Transform* to use DataWeave to map fields between your received data and what to use with your Salesforce component.

The following are examples of the operations you can set in the Salesforce component:

*Create*:

* *Type*: Salesforce object type.

=== Connector Property Values

The following are four example operations of the many you can set for the Salesforce connector. 
These are the important fields for these example operations: 

Create:

* *Type*: Salesforce object type.
* *Records*: Function editor expression.

Query:

* *Salesforce query*: Salesforce query to retrieve objects.
* *Parameters*: Values for placeholders in the salesforce query.

Update:

* *Type*:  Salesforce object type.
* *Records*: Function editor expression to produce a collection of Salesforce objects to be updated.

Delete:

* *Records To Delete Ids*: Function editor expression to produce a collection of Salesforce objects to be deleted.

=== Keep a Session Alive

For the Mule 4 Salesforce Connector, you have the option to keep the session alive until it expires by setting the *Disable session invalidation* field to True in the *Global Element Properties* > General > Advanced tab, or by setting  `disableSessionInvalidation="true"` in the XML flow.

The Mule app controls the lifecycle connections. When the app determines that a given connection is not needed anymore, it checks the setting of Disable Session Invalidation. When the setting is False (the default), the connector automatically destroys the connection for the session. To prevent a session from closing in this case, you can set the Disable Session Invalidation field to True or provide a function expression.

Salesforce uses the same session for all your threads, so for example, if your session is active and you log in again, Salesforce uses the existing session instead of creating a new one.

If the *Disable session invalidation* field is set to False, the connector automatically destroys the session after it's no longer needed.

You should keep the session alive when you are working with threads or concurrency in general. Salesforce uses
the same session for all your threads (for example, if you have an active session and you log in again, Salesforce uses the existing session instead of creating a new one). To make sure the connection doesn't close when a thread is finished, you should set the *Disable session invalidation* field to True in the Connection section of the connector's global element properties.

=== Use Mutual TLS

In v9.7.0 and later, all authentication types support Mutual TLS. To use this you need a keystore file in the JKS format, and a password for it. See <<Generate a Keystore File>> for more information.

Simply specify the path to the keystore file and the password in the configuration window (as shown in the image below) and any user that requires Mutual TLS authentication is able to login using the connector.

image::salesforce/salesforce-mutual-tls.png[Mutual TLS]

To set up the Mutual TLS certificate in your Salesforce environment, see https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=security_keys_uploading_mutual_auth_cert.htm&type=5[Set Up a Mutual Authentication Certificate].

=== Configure Apex Settings

You can set Apex REST and SOAP access using Studio or in XML. When you connect to Salesforce, the Salesforce connector gets the names of the Apex classes and methods belonging to them that can be invoked.

All Salesforce connection configurations support these Apex settings:

* *Fetch All Apex SOAP Metadata* - Fetches the metadata of all Apex SOAP classes. Takes precedence over Apex Class Name settings. 
* *Fetch All Apex REST Metadata* - Fetches the metadata of all Apex REST classes. Takes precedence over Apex Class Name settings.
* *Apex Class Names* - List of Apex class names to use for limiting the set of classes you fetch along with the methods they expose. This setting can speed the fetch process if there are a lot of classes that you do not need to fetch.

You can provide Apex settings in Design Center and in Anypoint Studio 7.

Click the *Apex* tab to choose the settings.

Apex settings values:

* *Fetch All Apex SOAP Metadata* - Fetches the metadata of all Apex SOAP classes.
* *Fetch All Apex REST Metadata* - Fetches the metadata of all Apex REST classes.

Apex Class Names:

The *Expression*, *Edit inline*, or *Bean reference* choices provide these options:

* *None* - No Apex class name is listed for DataSense to acquire.
* *From a message* - Lets you specify a class name using an expression.
* *Create object manually* - DataSense acquires only those classes and methods that you put in a list.

[NOTE]
====
The *Fetch All Apex SOAP Metadata* and *Fetch All Apex REST Metadata* check boxes take precedence over the *Apex Class Names* setting. If these boxes are selected, they fetch all the Apex SOAP metadata or Apex REST metadata regardless of your selection in the Apex Class Names section.
====

=== Apex XML Settings

* To fetch all SOAP metadata, add the `fetchAllApexSoapMetadata="true"` attribute to the `<salesforce:sfdc-config` statement.
* To fetch all REST metadata, add the `fetchAllApexRestMetadata="true"` attribute to the `<salesforce:sfdc-config` statement.
* To add Apex class names, set them in the `<salesforce:apex-class-names >` block.

For example:

[source,example,linenums]
----

== Create a Consumer Key

A consumer key is required when setting up OAuth 2.0 configurations for the Salesforce connector. It is used by the OAuth JWT and SAML bearer configurations and by the OAuth Username Password configuration.

This procedure provides guidance on using Salesforce to create a consumer key, and explains how to create a connected app in Salesforce. However, the steps might differ somewhat in your Salesforce instance.

Prerequisite:

This procedure assumes that you already have a certification file (such as `salesforce-cert.crt`). If not, you can produce one by generating a Java KeyStore and Public Key.

[[create-consumer-key]]
. Log into Salesforce, and go to *Setup* > *Build* > *Create* > *Apps*.
. Under the Connected App section, click *New*.
. To create a new connected app, enter:
+
* A name for the connected app.
* The API name.
* Contact email.
+
. Under API (Enable OAuth Settings), select *Enable OAuth Settings*:
+
* Enter the *Callback URL*.
* Select the *Use Digital Signatures* checkbox.
* Click *Browse* (or *Choose File*), and load your Salesforce certificate (for example, `salesforce-cert.crt`), which contains your public key.
+
In Studio, you typically store this in the workspace that contains your Mule application.
+
. Add and Save these OAuth scopes to Selected OAuth Scopes:
+
*Full Access* (`full`) and *Perform Requests On Your Behalf At Any Time* (`refresh_token`, `offline_access`)
+
. Configure the Authorization Settings for the app.
. Click *Manage*. In the OAuth Policies section, expand the *Permitted Users* dropdown, and select *Admin Approved Users are Pre-Authorized*. Then click *Save*.
. Under the Profiles section, click *Manage Profiles*.
. Select your user profile and click *Save*.
. Go back to the list of Connected Apps: *Build* > *Create* > *Apps*.
. Under the Connected Apps section, select the connected app you created.

You can see the Consumer Key that you need to provide in your connector's configuration.

== Generate a Keystore File

The Keystore is the path to the keystore used to sign data during authentication. Only the Java keystore (JKS) format is allowed.

To generate a keystore file:

. Go to your Mule workspace and open the command prompt (for Windows) or Terminal (for Mac).
. Type this command and press enter:
+
[source]
----
keytool -genkeypair -alias salesforce-cert -keyalg RSA -keystore salesforce-cert.jks
----
+
. Enter the following:
+
** Password for the keystore.
** Your first name and last name.
** Your organization unit.
** Name of your city, state, and the two letters code of your country.
+
The system generates a Java keystore file containing a private or public key pair in your workspace. 
The generated keystore file is in JKS format.
+
. Provide the file path for the keystore in your connector configuration.
+
Type this command and press enter:
+
[source]
----
keytool -exportcert -alias salesforce-cert -file salesforce-cert.crt -keystore salesforce-cert.jks
----
+
The system exports the public key from the keystore into the workspace. This is the public key that you need to enter in your Salesforce instance.
+
. Make sure that you have both the keystore (salesforce-cert.jks) and the public key (salesforce-cert.crt) files in your workspace.

== Specify the Lead ID in LeadConvertRequest

To specify the “Lead Id” in the LeadConvertRequest, use a DataWeave transform message. 
To transform a message before the operation, add the `leadId` field. 
The metadata for the operation doesn't specify the `leadId` field.

For example:

[source,example,linenums]
----
<ee:transform doc:name="Transform Message" >
            <ee:message >
                <ee:set-payload ><![CDATA[%dw 2.0
output application/java
---
{
    leadId: "LEAD_ID",
    accountId: "ACCOUNT_ID",
    convertedStatus: "Closed - Converted",
    doNotCreateOpportunity: true
} as Object {
    class : "org.mule.extension.salesforce.api.core.LeadConvertRequest"
}]]></ee:set-payload>
            </ee:message>
</ee:transform>
----

== Handle Events and Topics

Your application can receive events by subscribing to a Salesforce topic.

Each event that travels through your flows contains information about the Salesforce data that has changed, how it changes, and when. The connector parses this information and sends you information that a flow can work with.

Inbound properties of events:

* `payload`
* `createdDate`
* `replayId`

Salesforce stores events for 24 hours, so you can retrieve stored events during that retention window. A subscriber (to a topic or channel) can retrieve events at any time and is not restricted to listening to events at the time they are sent.

Each broadcast event is assigned a numeric ID. IDs are incremented and not guaranteed to be contiguous for consecutive events. Each ID is guaranteed to be higher than the ID of the previous event. For example, the event following the event with ID 999 can have an ID of 1025. The ID is unique for the organization and the channel. The IDs of deleted events are not reused.

See also <<Receive Inbound Data From Salesforce>> for event processing
when streaming data to an application from Salesforce.

Sections:

* <<Receive Events for a Topic>>
* <<Subscribe Topic>>
* <<Replay Topic>>
* <<Receive Custom Event Notifications>>

=== Receive Events for a Topic

Before you can receive events for Salesforce changes that are associated with a topic, you must first create a topic (a PushTopic). A PushTopic is a special object in Salesforce that binds a name (the topic's name) and Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) query together. Once a PushTopic is created, you can subscribe to it by using its name.

In Design Center, you can either use the Create (`create`) or Publish Topic (`publish-topic`) operations to create a topic. Example of the required fields for these operations:

* *Topic Name*: `AccountUpdates`
* *Query*: `SELECT Id, Name FROM Account`

Example in XML for `publish-topic`:

`<sfdc:publish-topic name="AccountUpdates" query="SELECT Id, Name FROM Account"/>`

Alternatively, in Salesforce you might create a topic by executing code like this from an Enter Apex Code window, accessible through your system logs:

[source,text,linenums]
----
PushTopic pushTopic = new PushTopic();
pushTopic.ApiVersion = 23.0;
pushTopic.Name = 'AllAccounts';
pushTopic.Description = 'All records for the Account object';
pushTopic.Query = 'SELECT Id, Name FROM Account';
insert pushTopic;
System.debug('Created new PushTopic: '+ pushTopic.Id);
----

== Subscribe Topic

After you create a topic, you can start receiving events by subscribing to the topic. To do so, add the Subscribe Topic (`subscribe-topic`) or a Replay Topic (`replay-topic`) trigger to your flow. The trigger acts as an inbound endpoint. Every time the subscription receives an event, the trigger executes the rest of the flow in your Mule app. In the XML example below, it prints a message to the log at INFO level.

In Design Center, use `Subscribe Topic` or `Replay Topic` operations for the Salesforce connector as the trigger. 
In Studio 7, use the `Subscribe topic` or `Replay topic` operations as a message processor (add the operation in the
source area of the canvas to have the operation process incoming messages).

In XML, you use `subscribe-topic` or `replay-topic` as the trigger:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="accountUpdatesSubscription">
    <!-- INBOUND ENDPOINT -->
    <sfdc:subscribe-topic topic="AccountUpdates"/>
    <!-- REST OF YOUR FLOW -->
    <logger level="INFO" message="Received an event for Salesforce Object ID #[map-payload:Id]"/>
</flow>
----

NOTE: When subscribing to a topic that was not previously published in Salesforce, the subscription is marked as successful; however, when the topic is later published, the user who subscribes to it does not receive notifications regarding that topic. The user has to resubscribe after the topic is created.

=== Replay Topic

A subscriber can specify which events to receive, such as all events within the retention window or those that start after a particular event. The default is to receive only new events sent after subscribing. Events outside the 24-hour retention period are discarded.

The Replay Topic provides these options:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Design Center Option | XML Value |Description
| `All` | `ALL` | Subscriber receives all events, including past events that are within the 24-hour retention period and new events sent after subscribing.
| `Only New` | `ONLY_NEW` | Subscriber receives new events that are broadcast after the client subscribes.
| `From Replay Id` | `FROM_REPLAY_ID` | Subscriber receives all events after the specified event `replayId`. 
|===

In Studio, the *Resume from the Last Replay Id* check box lets you specify an automatic replay of stored events, based on the Replay ID of the last event processed by the connector. This functionality can be useful in cases when the connector stopped listening for some reason, such as a server shutdown or dropped connection. If the stored Replay ID is outside the 24-hour retention period, your replay option determines what events to replay.

In this XML example, the Replay Topic acts like an inbound endpoint for the Logger message:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="accountUpdatesReplay">
    <!-- INBOUND ENDPOINT -->
    <sfdc:replay-topic topic="AccountUpdates" replayId="1" replayOption="ALL" autoReplay="true"/>
    <!-- REST OF YOUR FLOW -->
    <logger level="INFO" message="Replayed events: #[payload]"/>
</flow>
----

If the `ALL` or `ONLY_NEW` replay option is selected, then the `replayId` value is ignored.

=== Receive Custom Event Notifications

The Salesforce connector provides two operations that are useful for getting custom event notifications. These notifications pertain to general events that are not tied to Salesforce data changes.

. Create a streaming channel with the `Publish Streaming Channel` operation.
+
A `StreamingChannel` is a special Salesforce object that represents a channel used for notifying listeners of generic Streaming API events.
+
You can also create a streaming channel through the Salesforce or through Workbench.
+
. Subscribe to the channel through the Subscribe Channel operation.
+
The Salesforce connector converts the custom events in your streaming channel to Mule events and dispatches them to your flows.

== Push Data to Salesforce

Use as an outbound connector in your flow to push data to Salesforce. To use the connector in this capacity, simply place the connector in your flow at any point after an inbound endpoint.

== Receive Inbound Data From Salesforce

You can use the Salesforce connector as an inbound connector without wrapping the connector in a poll scope to stream data from Salesforce into your application. To use the connector in this capacity, place a Salesforce connector at the start of your flow.

[NOTE]
Studio automatically converts the connector to Salesforce (Streaming) mode. Technically, this is still the same connector, but Studio accesses the Salesforce Streaming API. In this API, the only operation the converted connector can perform is Subscribe to topic (that is, subscribe to PushTopic).

image::salesforce/salesforce-studio-subscribe-streaming-channel.png[subscribe streaming channel]

Salesforce connector: Listens to notifications on a topic and feeds the data into the flow.

See also: https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_streaming.meta/api_streaming/intro_stream.htm[Streaming API]

Streaming channels provide notifications to subscribers that are not limited to record-based events. You can use the Salesforce Connector to work with Salesforce streaming channels.

=== Create a Streaming Channel to Receive Data From Salesforce

You must have the proper Streaming API permissions enabled in your organization.

. Log into your Salesforce Developer Edition organization.
. Under All Tabs (+), select Streaming Channels.
. On the Streaming Channels tab, select New to create a new Streaming Channel.
. Enter /u/notifications/ExampleUserChannel in Streaming Channel Name, and an optional description.

You can either use the `create` operation or the exclusive `publish-streaming-channel` operation as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<sfdc:publish-streaming-channel name="/u/Notifications" description="General notifications"/>
----

=== Subscribe to a Streaming Channel

After you create a streaming channel, you can start receiving events by subscribing to the channel. The `subscribe-streaming-channel` acts like an inbound endpoint and is used as follows:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="notificationsChannelSubscription">
	<!-- INBOUND ENDPOINT -->
	<sfdc:subscribe-streaming-channel streamingChannel="/u/TestStreaming"/>
	<!-- REST OF YOUR FLOW -->
	<logger level="INFO" message="Received an event: #[payload]"/>
</flow>
----

A Mule flow is divided in two. The first portion is usually an inbound endpoint (or an HTTP connector) and a message source. The Mule flow is an entity that receives and generates events that later are processed by the rest of the flow. The other portion is a collection of message processors that processes the messages (also known as events) that are received and generated by the inbound endpoint.

Every time a subscription to `/u/TestStreaming` receives an event, it executes the rest of the flow. In this example, it prints a message to the log at INFO level.

=== Stream Channel Inbound Properties

This information gets passed along as inbound properties:

* `channel` - Maps to the Channel JSON property.
* `type` - Maps to the Type JSON property in data.
* `createdDate` - Maps to the createdDate JSON property in data.

Except for `channel`, each property inside an event is available as an inbound property.

=== Replay Events from a Streaming Channel

A streaming channel can replay notifications, much like topic replay.

The `replay-streaming-channel` acts like an inbound endpoint and can be used like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="flowStreamingChannelReplay">
    <!-- INBOUND ENDPOINT -->
    <sfdc:replay-streaming-channel streamingChannel="/u/Notifications" replayId="1" replayOption="ALL"/>
    <!-- REST OF YOUR FLOW -->
    <logger level="INFO" message="Replayed events: #[payload]"/>
</flow>
----

If the `ALL` or `ONLY_NEW` replay options are selected, then the `replayId` value is ignored.

=== Push Events to a Streaming Channel

Salesforce lets you push custom events to a specific streaming channel through the REST API. You can use the Salesforce https://workbench.developerforce.com/about.php[Workbench] or this connector.

To use `push-generic-event` operation:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="flowPushGenericEvent">
    <!-- INBOUND ENDPOINT -->
    <sfdc:push-generic-event channelId="0M6j0000000KyjBCAS">
    	<sfdc:events>
            <sfdc:event payload="Notification message text"/>
        </sfdc:events>
	</sfdc:push-generic-event>
    <logger level="INFO" message="Replayed events: #[payload]"/>
</flow>
----

The channel ID can be retrieved from the response map of the `publish-streaming-channel` operation.

Another way to retrieve the ID of the channel is from the Salesforce page:

. Log into your Developer Edition organization.
. Under All Tabs (+), select Streaming Channels.

If the channel ID field is not visible in the channel list:

. Click Create New View.
. Type a name for the view in the Name input field.
. In the Available Fields list, select Streaming Channel ID, and click Add.
. Add any other fields you want.
. Click Save.

Now you should see the channel ID for each streaming channel in the list.

The JSON received as response from the push event operation looks like this:

[source,json,linenums]
----
[
	{
	"userOnlineStatus": {
	},
	"fanoutCount": 0
	}
]
----

== Load Data in Batches

The Salesforce Bulk API loads batches of your organization's data into Salesforce.

The Salesforce connector provides the Create and Create Bulk operations for working
with the Bulk API.

For all bulk operations, Salesforce handles the creation process in the background, so the connector does not reply with a collection of SaveResults because it does not have them yet. Instead, the connector replies with a BatchInfo object, which contains the ID of the batch and the ID of the job it creates to upload those objects.

=== Track the Status of Bulk Data

You can monitor a Bulk API batch in Salesforce through the Job ID for the Bulk Data Load Jobs.

The job detail page in Salesforce includes a related list of all the batches for the job. The related list provides View Request and View Response links for each batch. If a batch is a CSV file, the links return the request or response in CSV format. If a batch is an XML file, the links return the request or response in XML format.

In Salesforce, you can track the status of bulk data load jobs and their associated batches:

. Click YOUR_NAME > *Setup* > *Monitoring* > *Bulk Data Load Jobs*. 
. Click the Job ID to view the job detail page.

The job detail page includes a related list of all the batches for the job. The related list provides View Request and View Response links for each batch. If the batch is a CSV file, the links return the request or response in CSV format. If the batch is an XML file, the links return the request or response in XML format. These links are available for batches created in Salesforce API version 19.0 and later.

== Usage Notes

=== Get Updated Objects

In Mule 3, you can call the *Get Updated Objects* operation with an `initialTimeWindow` value, for example, 10 minutes. The connector fetches the objects that were updated in the last 10 minutes. After that if you use the operation again, the operation retrieves the objects that were updated after the last object in the previous call. In Mule 3, you can reset the timestamp and be able to use the `initialTimeWindow` parameter again, call the `resetUpdatedObjectsTimestamp` operation. 

In Mule 4, to achieve the same result:

. Call the *Get Updated Objects* operation, which has the `duration` parameter - exactly the same behavior as `initialTimeWindow` and returns the updated object IDs.
. Call the *Retrieve* operation to specify the IDs obtained at step 1.

The *Get Updated Objects* operation stores its results persistently by the timestamp of the latest objects.

=== Fields To Null

* If you set the *Can Clear Fields by Updating Field Value to Null* checkbox, all fields in a request that have a Null value are added to the `fieldsToNull` field and sent to Salesforce. This checkbox appears on the General > Advanced tab in the Global Element Properties screen.

* You can decide which fields to set to Null without being forced to use the `fieldsToNull` field.

=== Upsert

* Unless you configure the External ID Field Name for the SObject (Salesforce object) to which you are trying to upsert, every use of the upsert fails.
* The upsert operation does not work with the SObject `priceBookentry2`.
* While you can't change the `contentType` for bulk upsert, you can use the `Create Job` operation to set the contentType to either CSV or zipped CSV (if you're near the character limit). Follow up with the `Create Batch` operation.

=== Query

* Even though you can see the fields of an SObject and its corresponding types via DataSense, the `Query` operation returns all fields as `String`.

* If you want to use the actual type of the field, you must convert that field to the desired type using a Transform (or Transform Message) component.

* Although `CreatedDate` field appears as `dateTime`, the query returns a `String` representing the date.

* To actually use the field as a `dateTime`, you can configure it using Transform Message.

* To store `Date` and `dateTime` fields, you can use DataWeave expressions to create `Date` and `Calendar` Java objects.

=== Insert values into a Salesforce Drop-down

* Be aware that inserting dependent values into an existing drop-down list field in Salesforce does not always work. Test to confirm functionality.

=== Evaluate Values in a Salesforce Drop-down

* If you are evaluating against a value in an existing drop-down list field in Salesforce, be sure to use the exact value in the dropdown. For example, if you use the value `US` to evaluate against the contents of a drop-down list that contains the value `USA`, the evaluation works, but you end up with two values in the dropdown: one for `US` and one for `USA`.

=== Currency

* Currency values cannot exceed 18 characters in length.
* When working with multiple currencies, be aware of which currency your SObject uses so that you avoid inaccurate entries. The default currency matches the location at the organization level.

=== Limits on API Calls

* You need to know the rate limiting policy that applies to your account so that you do not exceed the number of allotted API calls per day.

=== Opportunity Object

When extracting data from an `Opportunity`, be aware that a "quarter" is not relative to a calendar year. A "quarter" in this context is relative to the financial year of the organization.

== Example: Accept and Transform Data

image::salesforce/salesforce-outbound.png[]

* HTTP connector: Accepts data from HTTP requests.
* Transform Message: Transforms a data structure and its format to produce output that the Salesforce connector expects.
* Salesforce connector: (Outbound) Connects with Salesforce and performs an operation to push data to Salesforce.

=== Inbound Scenario

image::salesforce/salesforce-inbound.png[]

. Scheduler connector: Triggers a flow as configured.
. Salesforce connector: Connects with Salesforce, and returns an InputStream with the query results.
. Transform Message: Transforms a data structure and its format to produce output that the File connector expects.
. File connector: Records data in a file, such as a CSV file, and saves it in a user-defined directory or location.

=== Example: XML

Paste this XML code into Anypoint Studio to experiment with the two flows described in the previous section.

== Example: Create or Update an Object With Parent Child Relationships

A Salesforce object can have standard or custom relationships between objects.

The relationships between the objects are usually one-to-many parent child relationships,
but can be any link between two objects residing in Salesforce.

Creating or altering objects with relationships is challenging. This section shows how to perform an upsert for an object using the Salesforce connector.

Create a structure in Salesforce for this relationship.

This example assumes two custom types: `MyCustomObject` and `MyOtherCustomObject`.

MyCustomObject must hold a relationship to a MyOtherCustomObject. When upserting a `MyCustomObject`, the POJO sent as input to the Salesforce connector looks like this:

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
	...
	// MyCustomObject's fields ...
	OtherObject__r:
	{
		CustomField__c : 'ABC123',
		type: 'MyOtherCustomObject__c'
	}
}
----

`OtherObject` is the name of `MyCustomObject` field whose value must be a reference to a `MyOtherCustomObject` object. `OtherObject__r` indicates the name of the field that is set and that its a relationship to another object.

The value of this field must be an object with two fields.

A field named type with the referenced object type name as value. In this case a custom `MyOtherCustomObject` type.

A field with value and name appropriate to identify the right instance
of `MyOtherCustomObject` to reference. In this case is the one with a value of `ABC123` for the field named `CustomField`.

The following XML example shows how to update these objects:

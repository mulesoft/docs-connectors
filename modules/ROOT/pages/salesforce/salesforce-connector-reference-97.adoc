| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform expires the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime purges the instances when it sees fit. |  |

[[create]]
=== Create
`<salesforce:create>`

Adds one or more new records to your organization's data. 

IMPORTANT: When you map your objects to the input of this message processor, keep in mind that they need to match the expected type of the object at Salesforce. Take the CloseDate of an Opportunity as an example, if you set that field to a string of value "2019-12-13" it is sent to Salesforce as a string and operation is rejected on the basis that CloseDate is not of the expected type. The proper way to actually map it is to generate a Java Date object, you can do so using Groovy expression evaluator as `#[groovy:Date.parse("yyyy-MM-dd", "2019-12-13")]`. 


==== Parameters
[%header%autowidth.spread]

[[getUpdatedObjects]]
=== Get Updated Objects

`<salesforce:get-updated-objects>`

Retrieves a list of records that have been updated between the last time this method was called and the current server's timestamp. 

The Salesforce API ignores the seconds portion of dates, so subsequent calls of this operation take place at a rate of at least one minute. Subsequent calls within a minute do not return results.

For example, if a request is sent at `12:14:05` and the *Initial Time Window* field is set to 3 minutes, the *Get Updated Object* operation sends the Salesforce API this interval: `12:11:00 - 12:14:00`. Thereafter, the next request is `12:14:00 - 12:15:00` if the operation is invoked after one minute.

==== Parameters

| Type a| String |  Object type. The specified value must be a valid object for your organization. |  | x
| Initial Time Window a| Number |  Time window in minutes used to calculate the start time (in a time range) the first time this operation is called. 

For example, if *Initial Time Window* is `2`, the start time is the current time (now) minus 2 minutes. The range to retrieve the updated object then becomes `now - 2 minutes; now`. After the first call, the start time is calculated from the object store value that provides the last time this operation executed. |  | x
| Fields a| Array of String |  The fields to retrieve for the updated objects. |  | x
| Update Headers a| <<RequestHeaders>> |  http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api/Content/soap_headers.htm[Salesforce Headers] |  |
| Target Variable a| String |  The name of a variable in which the operation's output is placed. |  |
| Target Value a| String |  An expression to evaluate against the operation's output and the outcome of that expression is stored in the target variable. |  `#[payload]` |

 updating an existing contact.

IMPORTANT: if you are converting a lead into a person account, do not specify the contactId or an error will result. Specify only the accountId of the person account. If no contactID is specified, then the API creates a new contact that is implicitly associated with the Account. To create a new contact, the client application must be logged in with sufficient access rights. To merge a lead into an existing contact, the client application must be logged in with read/write access to the specified contact. The contact name and other existing data are not overwritten (unless overwriteLeadSource is set to true, in which case only the LeadSource field is overwritten). For information on IDs, see ID Field Type. |  | 
| Account Id a| String | ID of the Account into which the lead is merged. Required only when updating an existing account, including person accounts. If no accountID is specified, then the API
 creates a new account. To create a new account, the client application must be logged in with sufficient access rights. To merge a lead into an existing account, the client
 application must be logged in with read/write access to the specified account. The account name and other existing data are not overwritten. For information on IDs, see ID.

| Send Email To Owner a| Boolean | Specifies whether to send a notification email to the owner specified in the ownerId (true) or not (false, the default). | false | 
| Opportunity Name a| String | Name of the opportunity to create. If no name is specified, then this value defaults to the company name of the lead. The maximum length of this field is 80 characters. If
 doNotCreateOpportunity argument is true, then no Opportunity is created and this field must be left blank; otherwise, an error is returned. |  | 
| Do Not Create Opportunity a| Boolean | Specifies whether to create an Opportunity during lead conversion (false, the default) or not (true). Set this flag to true only if you do not want to create an opportunity
 from the lead. An opportunity is created by default. | false | 
| Over Write Lead Source a| Boolean | Specifies whether to overwrite the LeadSource field on the target Contact object with the contents of the LeadSource field in the source Lead object (true), or not (false,
 the default). To set this field to true, the client application must specify a contactId for the target contact. | false | 
| Opportunity Id a| String | The ID of an existing opportunity to relate to a lead during lead conversion. |  |

[[repeatable-in-memory-iterable]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Iterable

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | The number of instances to initially keep in memory to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can fit into this buffer, then the buffer expands according to the bufferSizeIncrement attribute, with an upper limit of maxInMemorySize. Default value is 100 instances. |  | 
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This is by how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer should not expand, meaning that a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised when the buffer gets full. Default value is 100 instances. |  | 
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | The maximum amount of memory to use. If more than that is used then a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised. A value lower than or equal to zero means no limit. |  |

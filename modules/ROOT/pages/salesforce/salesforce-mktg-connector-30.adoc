The Salesforce Marketing Cloud connector lets you connect to the Marketing Cloud API web services (now known as the Marketing Cloud API), which is also known as the Salesforce Marketing Cloud. This connector exposes convenient operations for exploiting the capabilities of Salesforce Marketing Cloud.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Salesforce Marketing, Mule, Anypoint Connectors, Anypoint Studio, Mule concepts, elements in a Mule flow, and Global Elements.

You need login credentials to test your connection to your target resource.

For hardware and software requirements and compatibility
information, see the Connector Release Notes.

To use this connector with Maven, view the pom.xml dependency information in
the Dependency Snippets in Anypoint Exchange.

== What's New in this Connector

This connector version has the same operations as the 2.x versions only that some of them were grouped differently and the connector does not use the FuelSDK anymore but instead performs the SOAP requests itself.

The operations are grouped as follows:

. Configure Create, Configure Update, Configure Delete operations were grouped in a single operation called Configure and the Action(Create, Update, Delete) will be specified as a parameter.
. Perform Start, perform Stop and Perform Get Max Count operations were grouped in one operation called Perform and the Action(Start, Stop, Get Max Count) will be specified as a parameter

OAuth Username and Password connection provider was removed since this authentication type was deprecated by the Marketing Could system and a new connection provider was added to leverage the OAuth Client Credentials authentication flow. Details about this type of authentication and its required parameters will be found in the following sections.

+
image::salesforce/salesforce-mktg-3-http-listener-config.png[HTTP Listener component]
+
. Click the image:salesforce/salesforce-mktg-as-plus-button.png[plus Button] next to Connector configuration.
. Specify the Host as localhost and Port as 8081, then click OK.
. Specify the Path as /create.
. Double-click Create (Salesforce Marketing Cloud).
+
image::salesforce/salesforce-mktg-3-smc-create-config.png[SMC Create config]
+
. Click the image:salesforce/salesforce-mktg-as-plus-button.png[plus Button] next to Connector configuration.
+
image::salesforce/salesforce-mktg-3-user-pass-config.png[SMC user-pass config]
+
. Specify the required fields with the credentials for your organization, then click OK.
. From the Object type drop down choose List.
. Double-click Transform Message (the one before Create) and configure it as below:
+
image::salesforce/salesforce-mktg-3-transform-before-config.png[Transform message before]
+
. Double-click Transform Message (the one after Create) and configure it as below:
+
image::salesforce/salesforce-mktg-3-transform-after-config.png[Transform message after]
+
. Once you are done with the Mule app, you can deploy it.
. Once deployed, use your favorite REST client and make a POST request to `+x-www-form-urlencoded to localhost:8081/create+` and the following parameter payload listName=testlist (such as `+curl -d listName=MyName-Test localhost:8081/create+`).
. You should get a successful result and once you get it, go to your instance and check that the list was created.

Note: For other entities you can use a similar flow but you have to change the Object Type in the Salesforce Marketing Cloud to the name of the object that you are going to create, and remap fields on the Transform Message component as needed. Upload and Delete could be configured in exactly the same way.

== Known Issues and Limitations

The Salesforce Marketing Cloud connector comes with a few caveats. If you are working with subclasses inside complex fields, trying to retrieve fields from a hierarchy or attempting to return an Automation object, see
the next section.

=== Workaround to Provide a Subclass Type to a Complex Field

Some objects in Salesforce Marketing Cloud have complex fields belonging to a base class (for example, a Recurrence field)
In this particular case, DataSense is only able to bring up fields specific to a base class, but you might want to use additional fields that belong to a subclass of that base class.

Note: You can achieve this behavior by manually adding the desired fields inside the Transform Message component. Also, for Salesforce Marketing Cloud to know that you want to work with a subclass and recognize the fields you added, you must also add an extra field called concreteClassType of type String whose value is the name of the subclass.

See the Providing a Subclass as a Type to a Complex Field section for an example detailing how to achieve this.

=== Retrieving Fields From a Hierarchy is Not Possible

The Retrieve operation allows you to retrieve records in a SQL query-like fashion.

Note: The Salesforce Marketing Cloud has a limitation preventing retrieval of fields that are part of a hierarchy.

To better illustrate this issue, consider this example. The Subscriber object has a complex structure:

image::salesforce/salesforce-mktg-as-subscriber-structure.png[subscriber structure]

The API only allows us to query fields on the first level, like EmailAddress or SubscriberKey but not fields like Attributes.Name

=== Server Results Containing an Automation Object Cause Exception to be Thrown

When performing an operation on an Automation object (like Create or Delete), the returned result also contains the structure of the Automation object you acted upon.

Note: The problem is that the server also returns an additional field in the Automation called isPlatformObject that is not recognized by the WSDL.

To bypass this issue, make all operations that directly use an Automation object asynchronous. If the operation is asynchronous, the immediate response of the operation is Operation Queued.

See the Asynchronous Operations section for more information on how to make operations asynchronous.

== Common Use Cases

The following are the common use cases for the Salesforce Marketing Cloud connector:

* Configure action - Calls the Configure command with the action(Create, Delete, Update) attribute when connected to the Marketing Cloud API SOAP web service.
* Create entities - Creates new objects on the Marketing Cloud API web server.
* Delete objects - Deletes a existing objects on the Marketing Cloud API web server.
* Perform action - Calls the Perform command with the action(GetMaxCount, Start, Stop) attribute when connected to the Marketing Cloud API SOAP web service.
* Retrieve entities - Retrieves objects from the Marketing Cloud API web server in a SQL query-like fashion.
* Schedule start - Calls the Schedule command with Start as the action attribute when connected to the Marketing Cloud API SOAP web service.
* Update entities - Updates a existing objects on the Marketing Cloud API web server.
* Upsert entities - Creates objects if the objects do not already exist, or deletes existing objects on the Marketing Cloud API web server This operation is achieved by using Create method of the Salesforce Marketing Cloud SOAP API.

=== Add a Proxy

To use a proxy server the following configuration properties can be set on the advanced tab of your configuration:

image::salesforce/salesforce-mktg-3-proxy.png[Schedule Start Automation]


=== Providing a Subclass as a Type to a Complex Field

Let's say we want to schedule an existing Automation to send emails to a list of subscribers once per minute.

To do this, we would input a Schedule Reference into the connector through a flow variable for example, to provide details about the schedule. +

image::salesforce/salesforce-mktg-3-schedule-start-automation.png[Schedule Start Automation]

Details such as how much time should pass between emails sent should go into a field called Recurrence.
The field Recurrence found in ScheduleDefinition, for example, is a complex field that has no structure.

To specify that we want to work with a MinutelyRecurrence, and not a Recurrence, we must manually
add the fields belonging to the MinutelyRecurrence class, and add an
extra field called concreteClassType of type String whose value is the name of the subclass.

Here is how the mapping for the ScheduleDefinition would look in the Variables (vars) for our example:

image::salesforce/salesforce-mktg-3-schedule-definition-transform-config.png[Schedule Definition]

Notice that the recurrence map has a field called minuteInterval that actually belongs to a subclass of Recurrence,
called MinutelyRecurrence.

For the connector to know that it is dealing with a MinutelyRecurrence object, we must also
add the extra concreteClassType field with MinutelyRecurrence as the value.

=== Asynchronous Operations

Most operations are synchronous by default, meaning that the connector waits for the result of the operation. For more details regarding the operations from Marketing Cloud API, access the Salesforce Marketing Cloud Methods documentation listed in the See Also section of this document.

To specify that you want an operation to behave asynchronously, you must use the Options parameter from the operation. We show in an example
how this behavior can be achieved for the Create operation. This can also be done in a similar fashion for the other operations.

In this example we create a list of Automation objects to provide in the payload.
Because Automation objects present an issue where the result of any
operation that directly works with this type of object throws an exception caused
by the presence of an unknown field, we make the
operation asynchronous; this allows us to bypass this issue.

The CreateOptions parameter is responsible with making the call asynchronous. In our example, the CreateOptions is provided in a Variables(vars).

image::salesforce/salesforce-mktg-3-create-automation-config.png[Create Automation]

This is how the mapping for CreateOptions looks in the Variables (vars). The field requestType determines the type of call (SYNCHRONOUS or ASYNCHORONOUS). The conversationID field assigns an unique identifier
to the asynchronous call.

Asynchronous calls can be grouped together using the conversationID, callsInConversation and sequenceCode fields (for example, if we want to make 5 asynchronous calls to the server, but we want them to execute together and we want to specify in which order to execute, we put the same conversationID to all of them, we put to callsInConversation the value 5, meaning that our group has 5 calls, and sequenceCode is the order of the call in the group).

For this example, because we have a single call, we pass a value of 1 to callsInConversation and sequenceCode.

image::salesforce/salesforce-mktg-3-create-automation-options.png[CreateOptions]

The Options parameter has more functionality that shown in this example. For further studying the capabilities of this
parameter, visit the Salesforce Marketing Cloud Objects documentation and look for the Option objects(such as for CreateOptions or DeleteOptions).

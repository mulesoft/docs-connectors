== Configure in Design Center

. In Anypoint Platform > *Design Center*, click *Create* > *Mule Application*.
. Provide a project name and click *Create*.
. Exit the *Let’s Get Started* wizard by clicking *Go straight to canvas*.
. For the trigger, if you want a Salesforce event to initiate access to your app (that is, to trigger your app), choose one of the Salesforce operations. Alternatively, you can use an *HTTP Listener* or *Scheduler* trigger.
+
Salesforce trigger operations:
+
* *On Deleted Object* - Delete an object.
* *On Modified Object* - Modify an object.
* *On New Object* - Create a new object. Possible object types are `Contact`, `Lead`, `Account`, `Contracts`, `Opportunity`, or the name of a custom object. The object types correspond to the Salesforce object you want to create, modify, or delete.
* *Replay Channel* - Subscribe to a streaming channel. This trigger provides channel-related notification settings for new events and events stored by Salesforce within the 24-hour retention period. Events that take place in the specified channel trigger the flow.
+
NOTE: Before you can subscribe to a channel or topic, it must first be published to Salesforce.
+
* *Replay Topic* - Subscribe to a topic. This trigger provides topic-related notification settings for new events and events stored by Salesforce within the 24-hour retention period. Events that take place on records in the specified topic trigger the flow.
* *Subscribe Channel* - Subscribe to a streaming channel. This trigger provides channel-related notification settings for new events that take place after you subscribe.
* *Subscribe Topic* - Subscribe to a topic. This trigger provides topic-related notification settings for new events that take place after you subscribe.

== Example: Configure a New Object Trigger

. Create a New Mule Application in Design Center.
. Set the trigger. For example, you can use *Salesforce* > *New Object*.
. Click *Set up*.

. Specify the parameters as required for each configuration type, and click *Test* to ensure you have a valid connection to Salesforce.
. If needed, configure the *Apex* tab to decide what metadata to fetch and to add Apex class names.
. If you haven't specified a `Connection Type`, and if needed, configure the *Advanced* tab to set the `Max Idle Time` and `Time Units` for how long to hold open a connection before it expires.
. After you specify a connection type, if needed, you can use the *Advanced* tab to change values for the Reconnection Strategy, Pooling Profile, and Expiration Policy.
. If needed, set the `Redelivery Policy` on the main configuration screen. This indicates the maximum number of tries to deliver trigger content.

== Configure a Design Center Component

After creating a trigger, click the plus sign. If needed, click *Transform* to use DataWeave to map fields between your received data and what to use with your Salesforce component.

The following are examples of the operations you can set in the Salesforce component:

*Create*:

* *Type*: Salesforce object type.
* *Records*: xref:design-center::function-editor-concept.adoc#to-use-the-function-editor[Function editor expression].

*Query*:

* *Salesforce query*: Salesforce query to retrieve objects.
* *Parameters*: Values for placeholders in the Salesforce query.

*Update*:

* *Type*: Salesforce object type.
* *Records*: xref:design-center::function-editor-concept.adoc[Function editor expression] to produce a collection of Salesforce objects to be updated.

*Delete*:

* *Records To Delete Ids*: xref:design-center::function-editor-concept.adoc[Function editor expression] to produce a collection of Salesforce objects to be deleted.

After completing the trigger, proceed to <<Configure Salesforce as a Component>>.

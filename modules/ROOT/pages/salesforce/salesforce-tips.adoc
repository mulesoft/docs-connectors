* Fields To Null: The configurations have a checkbox called Can Clear Fields by Updating Field Value to Null. If checked, all the fields in a request that have a Null value will be added to the `fieldsToNull` field and sent to Salesforce.
+
Using this feature, you can decide which fields to set to Null without being forced to use the `fieldsToNull` field.
+
* Upsert:
** Unless you configure the External ID Field Name for the sObject to which you are trying to Upsert, every use of the upsert will fail.
** The Upsert operation does not work with the sObject `priceBookentry2`.
* Query: Even though you can see the fields of an SObject and their corresponding types via DataSense, the Query operation returns _all_ fields as `String`.
+
If you want to use the actual type of the field, you must convert that field to the desired type using a Transform (or Transform Message) component.
+
In this example, although `CreatedDate` field appears as `dateTime`, the query returns a String representing the date.
+
In order to actually use the field as a dateTime, you can configure it using Transform Message, like in the example.
+
* Inserting values into a Salesforce drop-down: Be aware that inserting dependent values into an existing drop-down list field in Salesforce does not always work. Test to confirm functionality.
* Evaluating Values in Salesforce drop-down: If you are evaluating against a value in an existing drop-down list field in Salesforce, be sure to use the _exact value_ in the dropdown. For example, if you use the value "US" to evaluate against the contents of a drop-down list that contains the value "USA", the evaluation will work, but you end up with two values in the dropdown: one for US and one for USA.
* Currency:
** Currency values cannot exceed 18 characters in length.
** When working with multiple currencies, be aware of which currency your sObject uses so that you avoid inaccurate entries. The default currency matches the location at the organization level.
* Limits on API Calls: You need to know the rate limiting policy that applies to your account so that you do not exceed the number of allotted API calls per day.
* Opportunity `sObject`: When extracting data from an `Opportunity`, be aware that a "quarter" is not relative to a calendar year. A "quarter" in this context is relative to the financial year of the organization.

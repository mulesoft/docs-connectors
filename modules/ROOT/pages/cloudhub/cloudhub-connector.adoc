providing the following capabilities.

Exchange: https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange/com.mulesoft.connectors/mule-cloudhub-connector/[CloudHub Connector]

== Create the CloudHub Configuration

The basic CloudHub configuration has the following properties:

* Username: The user of the Anypoint Platform Account.
* Password: The password of the given user.
* Enviroment: Optional. Indicates which CloudHub environment to use. By default
it's the one defined as the default in Anypoint Platform.

.Minimum CloudHub Configuration
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<cloudhub:config name="CloudHub_Config" >
  <cloudhub:connection username="${ch.username}" password="${ch.password}" />
</cloudhub:config>
----

== POM File Information

If you create your app outside of Studio, update your POM file as follows:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.mulesoft.connectors</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-cloudhub-connector</artifactId>
  <version>RELEASE</version>
  <classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
</dependency>
----

Mule converts RELEASE to the latest version of the connector.

== Choose an Environment

=== List Available Environments

Once the username and password are configured correctly, users can
retrieve the available environments for an easier configuration.

image::cloudhub/cloudhub-environment-value-provider.gif[Available Environments]

=== Use the CloudHub Environment

If the application is going to be used on CloudHub sometimes is desired to
use the environment where the application is going to be deployed, for this case
the user can use the <<environment.id-sysprop,`environment.id`>> system property.

.Using the deployment environment
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<cloudhub:config name="CloudHub_Config" >
  <cloudhub:connection
  username="${ch.username}"
  password="${ch.password}"
  environment="${environment.id}"/>
</cloudhub:config>
----

[[creating-notifications]]
== Creating a Notification

Creating a notification is required to use the Create Notification operation.
This operation requires the message of the notification and the associated domain, that is, the application name.
<<domain-sysprop,The domain can be also be configured using the domain system property>>.

Optionally can be configured:

* Custom properties, an open object to provide additional information in the created notification.
* Transaction ID, the transaction id associated to the created notification.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="cloudhub-connector-flows" >
  <cloudhub:create-notification domain="some-application-name" config-ref="CloudHub_Config"
  transactionId="#[uuid()]" priority="WARN">
   <cloudhub:message >
     <![CDATA[#["Problem occurred trying to process customer data"]]]>
   </cloudhub:message>
   <cloudhub:custom-properties >
     <![CDATA[#[output application/java
---
{
 "customer-id" : "ASD-123",
 "date" : now()
}]]]></cloudhub:custom-properties>
  </cloudhub:create-notification>
 </flow>
----

.Configuring on Studio

[[listing-notifications]]
== List Notifications

When using notifications, the issue is the consumption of notifications.
For this purpose, use the List Notifications operation.

This operation requires only that you define the domain from where the notifications
are going to be retrieved. <<domain-sysprop,The domain can be also be configured using the domain system property>>.

Optionally can be configured:

* Limit - The number of notifications to retrieve, by default it's -1, which means all available.
* Status - Filters the notifications to only retrieve those that are unread, read, or all. By default only retrieves the ones marked as unread.
* Search - Only retrieves the ones that contains the given text.

[source,xml]
----
<cloudhub:list-notifications config-ref="CloudHub_Config" domain="some-application-name"/>
----

.Configuring on Studio
image::cloudhub/cloudhub-list-notifications.png[Listing Notifications]

This operation returns a list of notifications with the following structure.

[[notification-object]]
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
  Notification:
    type: object
    properties:
      id: string
      domain: string
      priority?: string
      read: boolean
      readOn?: datetime
      createdAt: datetime
      href: string
      properties: object
----

[[marking-notification]]
== Mark Notification as Read

Once a notification is consumed, marks the notification as Read
so that the next time notifications are read, only the unread ones are retrieved.

The operation Mark Notification only requires of the Notification ID, this can
be obtained from the `id` property of a <<notification-object,Notification object>>.

.Example of Marking notifications as Read
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<cloudhub:list-notifications config-ref="CloudHub_Config" domain="some-application-name"/>
<foreach>
  <cloudhub:mark-notification markAs="READ" config-ref="CloudHub_Config" notificationId="#[payload.id]"/>
</foreach>
----

[[listing-applications]]
== List Applications

With the connector you can retrieve all the available applications in the given environment.

There is nothing required to configure and works out of the box.

[source,xml]
----
<cloudhub:list-applications config-ref="CloudHub_Config"/>
----

There are several optional configurations to customize how to retrieve the information to have
a more lightweight response or to have more information about the applications.

[[retrieving-app-info]]
== Retrieve an Application

The connector retrieves information about an application's deployment. The only required
configuration is to define the domain and the application name.
<<domain-sysprop,The domain can be also be configured using the domain system property>>.

[source,xml]
----
<cloudhub:get-application domain="some-application-name" config-ref="CloudHub_Config"/>
----

Returns all information about the application deployment.

== Useful CloudHub System Properties

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Information |Usage
|[[domain-sysprop]] Domain |The name of the domain where the application is deployed in CloudHub. | ${domain}
|[[environment.id-sysprop]] Environment |The name of the environment where the application is deployed. | ${environment.id}

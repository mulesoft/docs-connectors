Blend stands for Better Lending. It is a platform designed to facilitate the various aspects of consumer lending. While Blend already leverages digitized, source-verified data wherever possible, in reality, the lending process is heavily dependent on paper documents.

Instead of relying on error-prone stare-and-compare techniques to condition a loan, loan teams can unlock data from uploaded documents through computer visioning and take advantage of Blend's automated follow-up workflow, which allows borrowers to satisfy conditions with 50 percent fewer interactions. This intelligent and efficient experience is one-way. Blend helps lenders keep origination costs down. Automated data validation constantly ensures that the data lifted from uploaded documents are well-formed and complete. If data doesn't pass the validation check, then these fields will not be used. Real-Time monitoring allows Blend to track trends in computer visioning success rate.

MuleSoft Blend connector offers simplified access to Blend's APIs to support workflows related to:

* Loans
* Borrowers
* Realtors
* Documents & Disclosures


== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Blend, Mule concepts, Anypoint connectors,
Anypoint Studio, the elements in a Mule flow, and global elements. 

The APIs use basic authentication, with the username and password are encoded in base64 using the following schema: `Basic base65(username, password)`. So, you need a Blend account and credentials to use the connector. For more information, see https://developers.blend.com/blend/docs/api-technical-standards-and-formats#section-authentication[Authentication] information in Blend's documentation.

For hardware and software requirements and compatibility, see the Connector Release Notes.

To use the Blend connector with Maven, find dependency information on the *Dependency Snippets* tab of Blend connector's page on the Anypoint Exchange.

== Configure Blend Connector in the Design Center

. In the Design Center, create a Mule application.
. On the canvas, configure HTTP Listener or Scheduler as a *trigger*.
. Click the *+* icon to add a component.
. Select the *Blend Connector*.
. Select an operation from the list.
. Configure the connector's global element.
** *Address*: URL to access Blend API
** *Username*: The user name to access Blend API
** *Password*: Password to access Blend API, which also serves as an Auth Token.
** *x-blend-deployment*: Your Blend deployment name
** *x-blend-special-instance-id*: Your special deployment instance ID, if required.
. Enter the parameters that are required for the operation.

== Install Blend Connector in Anypoint Studio

. In Anypoint Studio, click the *Exchange* icon in the Studio taskbar.
. Click *Login* in Anypoint Exchange.
. Search for the Blend connector, and click *Install*.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

== Connector Namespace and Schema

When designing your application in the Anypoint Studio, drag the connector from the palette to the canvas.
This action automatically populates the XML code with the connector namespace and schema location.

* Namespace: `+http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/blend+`
* Schema Location: `+http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/blend/current/mule-blend.xsd+`

== Configure Blend Connector in Anypoint Studio

. In Anypoint Studio, create a new Mule project. Ensure that you have *HTTP Listener* configured.
. Drag the connector to the Studio Canvas.
. Configure the connector's global element. You can either enter your credentials as global configuration properties or reference a configuration file that contains these values.
For simpler maintenance and better reuse of your project, MuleSoft recommends that you use a configuration file.
** *Address*: URL to access Blend API
** *Username*: The user name to access Blend API
** *Password*: Password to access Blend API, which also serves as an Auth Token.
** *x-blend-deployment*: Your Blend deployment name
** *x-blend-special-instance-id*: Your special deployment instance ID, if required.
+
TIP: An example configuration file for Blend
is available at `src/main/resources/configuration.yaml`. You can add this file in the Configuration Properties of the Global Configuration Elements.
+
. To ensure that your connection is successful, Click *Test Connection*.
. Select a connector operation.

== Use Case: Create a Blend Loan User and update Loan Properties

The following use case demonstrates how you can use the Blend connector along with Salesforce connector to:

* Create a loan in Blend for a Salesforce contact
* Update the loan properties in Blend and fetch the loan details

image::blend/blend-create-loan-get-data.png[Create User and Loan Application Flow]

To test this use case, 

. Create a Mule application and set the connector configuration properties in the configuration file in the `src/main/resources`. For example,
+
[source, yaml, linenums]
----
blend:
  baseurl: "<url-to-access-blend-api>"
  username: "<username-to-access-blend-api>"
  password: "<password-to-access-blend-api>"
  x-blend-special-instance-id: "<ID-of-your-special-deployment>"
  x-blend-deployment: "<ID-of-your-deployment>"
----
+
. Add the configuration file for the Blend connector to the *Configuration Properties* of the *Global Configuration Elements*.

To create the new Mule application flow:

. Drag an HTTP Listener to the canvas and configure it.
. From the *Palette*, search for the Salesforce connector and drag *Query* operation. To configure Salesforce operation, 
.. Add your query in the *Salesforce query*. For the purpose of this demo, use the following query to get the contact from Salesforce. 
+
[source, sql, linenums]
----
SELECT email,firstname, lastname,Id from Contact where id = ':id'
----
+
.. In the *Parameters* section, create a parameter with `id` as *Name* and the contact ID as *Value*.
. Select and drag Transform Message at the flow on the canvas to prepare the input for the Blend connector. Here's an example of the output payload in the transform message.
+

.. Set the *Target Value* in the *Advanced* section to `#[payload]`.
. From the *Mule Palette*, search and drag *Set Variable* operation after the Blend operation, to capture the loan ID returned from Blend into a variable. In the *Settings* section of the *Set Variable* operation, set the following:
.. *Name*: `loanId`
.. *Value*: `#[payload.id]`
. From Blend operations, drag *Update Loan Properties* operation. In the configuration options,
.. Use the following example payload in the *Patch loan body* of the *General* section:

Support Category: Premium

Mule supports the AS2 protocol through the AS2 Connector. The AS2 connector enables trading partners to transmit and receive AS2 messages with EDI-X12, EDIFACT, XML or binary payloads.

This connector leverages the AS2 protocol, allowing Mule applications to:

* Send messages, signed or unsigned, over HTTP or HTTPS, following the AS2 protocol.
* Receive messages, also over HTTP or HTTPS, following the protocol.

This document assumes that you are familiar with AS2, Mule, Anypoint Connectors, and Anypoint Studio.

For hardware and software requirements, see the Connector Release Notes.

NOTE: This connector requires http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html[Java Cryptography Extension (JCE)] installed on your Java runtime.


== How to Install

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio task bar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange and supply your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. Search for the connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

== About the Connector Namespace and Schema

In Anypoint Studio, when you drag the connector from the palette onto the Anypoint Studio canvas, Studio automatically populates the XML code with the connector namespace and schema location.

Namespace: `+http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/as2+` +
Schema Location `+http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/as2/current/mule-as2.xsd+`

If you are manually coding the Mule application in Studio's XML editor or another text editor, define the namespace and schema location in the header of your Configuration XML, inside the `<mule>` tag.

NOTE: Use `current` in the schema path to use the current Mule version.


== Configure the Connector Global Element

Place the connector in your flow as applicable for your use case.

To use the AS2 connector in your Mule application, create a global AS2 element for use by the AS2 connector. The AS2 connector provides the following global configuration parameters:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Key| Description
|Partner From - Name| Sender partner's name.
|Partner From - AS2 id| Sender partner's ID.
|Partner From - x509 alias| Sender alias as defined in the certificate file.
|Partner From - Email| Sender partner's email.
|Partner To - Name| Receiver partner's name.
|Partner To - AS2 id| Receiver partner's ID.
|Partner To - x509 alias| Receiver alias as defined in the certificate.
|Partner To - Email| Receiver partner's email.
|Partnership - Sender| The sender's name.
|Partnership - Receiver| The receiver's name.

|Receive Module Ports - Secure Receiver Keystore Path|The path of the keystore with the SSL certificate for the receiver source.
|Receive Module Ports - Secure Receiver Keystore Password|The password of the keystore.
|MDN Receiver Module Ports - Receiver Port|The port for the MDN receiver.
|MDN Receiver Module Ports - Secure Receiver Port|The secure port (SSL) for the MDN receiver.
|MDN Receiver Module Ports - Secure Receiver Keystore Path|The path of the keystore with the SSL certificate for the MDN receiver.

== Operations

. Send: Sends a message through HTTP or HTTPS using the AS2 protocol.
. Receive: Source that receives messages via HTTP or HTTPS using the AS2 protocol.

// == Using the Connector

// * <<use-case-1,Working example of send use case>>
// * <<use-case-2,Working example of receive source use case>>

// To configure the connector you have to complete the connector's global element properties with the required elements as // described above.

// You can set placeholders in each property and define them in the `mule-app.properties` file.

// [use-case-1]
// == Example of a Send Use Case

// NOTE: It is not possible to specify both receiver and secured receiver module ports.

// [use-case-2]

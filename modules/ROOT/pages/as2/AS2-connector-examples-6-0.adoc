== Example: Configure a Send AS2 Message

. Place the connector in your flow as applicable.
. To send an AS2 message with request for MDN in your Mule application, create a global `AS2 Connector Send config` element for use by the AS2 send operations.
The `AS2 Connector Send config`  provides the following global configuration parameters:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Key| Description
|Self config - AS2 Partner Name| Sender’s AS2 system identifier. Used for AS2-From and AS2-To headers.
|Self config - x509 alias| Sender’s certificate and/or private key alias in the keystore. Required if using signing or encryption.
|Self config - Email| Sender partner’s email.
|Partner config - AS2 ID| Receiver’s AS2 system identifier. Used for AS2-From and AS2-To headers.
|Partner config - x509 alias| Receiver’s Certificate and/or private key alias in the keystore. Required if using signing or encryption.
|Partner config - Email| Receiver partner’s email.
|Requester config - Subject| Free-form text for MIME subject header. Can include references to self or partner `simpleName` values along with the message `fileName`, for example, sending the `file example.txt` to partner via AS2.
|Requester config - MDN MIC Signature Algorithm| The algorithm with which MIC is calculated for the MDN signature. The message is `UNSIGNED` by default.
|Requester config - Request a receipt| Option to request a receipt from the partner. `SIGNED_OPTIONAL` by default.
|Requester config - Request delivery URL| Asynchronous receipt delivery URL that points to the MDN listener endpoint.
|Requester config - Encryption Algorithm| The encryption algorithm for encrypting the message. `UNENCRYPTED` by default.
|Requester config - MIC Signature Algorithm| The algorithm with which MIC is calculated for the message signature.  The message is `UNSIGNED` by default.
|Requester config - Content transfer encoding| The content transfer encoding. `BINARY` by default.
|Requester config - Compression type| ZLIB is the only supported compression and decompression type. `NONE` by default.
|Keystore config - Keystore Path| The path of the keystore where certificates and keys are provided.
|Keystore config - Keystore Password| The password for the keystore.
|Keystore config - Private key Password| The private key password, if required.
|===

. Configure a connection to the partner AS2 endpoint by providing the `Partner Base URL`.
. If you want to configure other connection details (such as TLS, proxy, basic authentication, and timeouts) do so now.
. Send the file or message by either using `Send with sync mdn` or `Send with async mdn`:

** The payload is the message content to be sent.

** Filename is the file name of the message being sent.

** The Boolean required to configure if the process should fail or if the receipt status is not processed.

. If you choose to request an asynchronous receipt, you must configure the `MDN Listener`.

=== Configure an MDN Listener

Place the connector’s `MDN Listener` as a source in your flow as applicable and reference the global config defined here.

|Self config - Email| Sender partner’s email.
|Partner config - AS2 ID| Receiver partner’s OID.
|Partner config - x509 alias| Receiver’s Certificate and/or private key alias in the keystore.
|Partner config - Email| Receiver partner’s email.
|HTTP Listener config| Reference to HTTP Listener global config.
|Keystore config - Keystore Path| The path of the keystore where certificates and keys are provided.
|Keystore config - Keystore Password| The password for the keystore.
|Keystore config - Private key Password| The private key password if required.

. Configure a connection to the partner if the MDN request is to be sent asynchronously.
. If you want to configure other connection details (such as TLS, proxy, and timeouts) do that now.

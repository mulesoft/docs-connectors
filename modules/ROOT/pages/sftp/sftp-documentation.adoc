SFTP Connector v1.2

Allows manipulating files through the FTP and SFTP.


== Configurations
---
[[config]]
=== Config


Default configuration.


==== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x
| Connection a| <<config_connection, SFTP Connection>>
 | The connection types to provide to this configuration. | | x
| Default write encoding (Deprecated) a| String |  This parameter is deprecated and is not taken into account. |  | 
| Time Between Size Check a| Number |  Wait time between size checks to determine if a file is ready to be read. This allows a file write to complete before processing. If no value is provided, the check is not performed. When enabled, Mule performs two size checks waiting the specified time between calls. If both checks return the same value, the file is ready to be read. This attribute works in tandem with the *Time Between Size Check Unit* field. |  | 
| Time Between Size Check Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  A TimeUnit that qualifies the *Time Between Size Check* attribute.  Defaults to MILLISECONDS. |  MILLISECONDS | 
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform expires the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime purges the instances when it sees fit. |  | 
|===

== Operations

[[copy]]
=== Copy

`<sftp:copy>`

Copies the file at the sourcePath into the targetPath.  If targetPath doesn't exist, and neither does its parent, then an attempt is made to create the file depending on the value of the createParentFolder argument. If such an argument occurs, then a SFTP:ILLEGAL_PATH is thrown.

If the target file already exists, then it is overwritten if the *Overwrite* field is set to `true`. Otherwise, the SFTP:FILE_ALREADY_EXISTS error is thrown. The source path can be either a file or a directory. If the source path points to a directory, then the file is copied recursively.

| Configuration | String | The name of the configuration to use. | | x
| Source Path a| String |  The path to the file to be copied. |  | x

[[move]]
=== Move

`<sftp:move>`

Moves the file at the *Source Path* into the *Target Path*.

If *Target Path* doesn't exist, and neither does its parent, then an attempt is made to create depending on the value of the *Create Parent Directories* argument. If *Create Parent Directories* is `false`, then SFTP:ILLEGAL_PATH is thrown.

If the target file exists, it is overwritten if  *Overwrite* is `true`. If *Overwrite* is `false`, SFTP:FILE_ALREADY_EXISTS error is thrown.  

The *Source Path* can either be a file or a directory. If a directory, then it is moved recursively.

* SFTP:ILLEGAL_PATH 
* SFTP:RETRY_EXHAUSTED 


[[read]]
=== Read

`<sftp:read>`

Obtains the content and metadata of a file at a given path. 

The operation returns a message with a payload that is an InputStream with the file's content, and the metadata is represented as a SftpFileAttributes object that's placed as the message Message#getAttributes() attributes.

If *Lock* is `true`, then a file system level lock is placed on the file until the input stream this operation returns is closed or fully consumed. Because the lock is actually provided by the host file system, its behavior might change depending on the mounted drive and the operation system on which Mule is running. Consider this before relying on this lock. 

This method also makes a best effort to determine the MIME type of the file being read. The file's extension is used to make an educated guess on the file's MIME type. The user also has the chance to force the output encoding and MIME type through the *Output Mime Type* and *Output Encoding* optional fields.


==== Parameters

| Configuration | String | The name of the configuration to use. | | x

[[rename]]

`<sftp:rename>`


Renames the file pointed to by the Path to the name provided in the *New Name* field. The *New Name* should not contain any path separator. SFTP:ILLEGAL_PATH is thrown if this precondition is not honored.

* SFTP:ILLEGAL_PATH 
* SFTP:RETRY_EXHAUSTED 


[[write]]
=== Write

`<sftp:write>`

Writes the content into the file pointed to by the path.

If the directory in which the file is attempting to be written doesn't exist, then the operation either throws SFTP:ILLEGAL_PATH error or creates the folder depending on the value of *Create Parent Directories*.  If the file itself already exists, then the behavior depends on the supplied mode.  This operation also provides locking support depending on the value of *Lock*, but follows the same rules and considerations as described in the Read operation.

== Sources

[[listener]]
=== On New or Updated File

`<sftp:listener>`


Polls a directory looking for files that have been created on it. One message is generated for each file that is found. 

The key part of this functionality is determining if a file is actually new: 

* Set the `autoDelete` parameter to `true` - This deletes each processed file after it has been processed, causing all files obtained in the next poll to be necessarily new.
* Set `moveToDirectory` parameter - This moves each processed file to a different directory after it has been processed, achieving the same effect as `autoDelete` but without loosing the file.
* Use the `watermarkMode` parameter to only pick files that have been created or updated after the last poll was executed. A matcher can also be used for additional filtering of files.


==== Parameters

|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Configuration | String | The name of the configuration to use. | | x
| Directory a| String |  The directory on which polled files are contained. |  |

| Time Between Size Check a| Number |  Wait time in milliseconds between size checks to determine if a file is ready to be read. This allows a file write to complete before processing. You can disable this feature by omitting a value. When enabled, Mule performs two size checks waiting the specified time between calls. If both checks return the same value, the file is ready to be read. |  | 
| Time Between Size Check Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS

| Output Encoding a| String |  The encoding of the payload that this operation outputs. |  | 
| Primary Node Only a| Boolean |  Whether this source should only be executed on the primary node when running in Cluster. |  | 
| Scheduling Strategy a| scheduling-strategy |  Configures the scheduler that triggers the polling. |  | x
| Streaming Strategy a| * <<repeatable-in-memory-stream>>
* <<repeatable-file-store-stream>>
* non-repeatable-stream |  Configure to use repeatable streams. |  | 
| Redelivery Policy a| <<RedeliveryPolicy>> |  Defines a policy for processing the redelivery of the same message. |  | 
| Reconnection Strategy a| * <<reconnect>>
* <<reconnect-forever>> |  A retry strategy in case of connectivity errors. |  | 
| Auto Delete a| Boolean |  Whether each file should be deleted after processing or not. |  false | 
| Move To Directory a| String |  If provided, each processed file is moved to a directory pointed by this path. |  | 
| Rename To a| String |  This parameter works in tandem with moveToDirectory. Use this parameter to enter the name under which the file should be moved. Do not set this parameter if moveToDirectory hasn't been set as well. |  | 
| Apply Post Action When Failed a| Boolean |  Whether any of the post actions (autoDelete and moveToDirectory) should also be applied in case the file failed to be processed. If set to false, no failed files are moved nor deleted. |  true |

If the stream contains more data than can fit into this buffer, then the buffer expands according to the bufferSizeIncrement attribute, with an upper limit of maxInMemorySize. Default value is 100 instances. |  | 
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This is by how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer should not expand, meaning that a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised when the buffer gets full. Default value is 100 instances. |  | 
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | The maximum amount of memory to use. If more than that is used then a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised. A value lower than or equal to zero means no limit. |  |

== Operations

[[copy]]
=== Copy
`<sftp:copy>`

Copies the file at the sourcePath into the targetPath. If targetPath doesn't exist, and neither does its parent, then an attempt is made to create depending on the value of the createParentFolder argument. If such an argument exists, then a SFTP:ILLEGAL_PATH is thrown. 

If the target file already exists, then it is overwritten if the overwrite argument is true. Otherwise, SFTP:FILE_ALREADY_EXISTS error is thrown. As for the sourcePath, it can either be a file or a directory. If it points to a directory, then it is copied recursively.

If targetPath doesn't exist, and neither does its parent, then an attempt is made to create depending on the value of the createParentFolder argument. If such an argument exists, then a SFTP:ILLEGAL_PATH is thrown. If the target file already exists, then it is overwritten if the overwrite argument is true.

[[read]]
=== Read
`<sftp:read>`

Obtains the content and metadata of a file at a given path. The operation itself returns a Message which payload is a InputStream with the file's content, and the metadata is represent as a SftpFileAttributes object that's placed as the message Message#getAttributes() attributes. 

If the lock parameter is set to true, then a file system level lock is placed on the file until the input stream this operation returns is closed or fully consumed. Because the lock is actually provided by the host file system, its behavior might change depending on the mounted drive and the operation system on which mule is running. 

Take that into consideration before blindly relying on this lock. This method also makes a best effort to determine the MIME type of the file being read. The file's extension is used to make an educated guess on the file's MIME type. The user also has the chance to force the output encoding and mimeType through the outputEncoding and outputMimeType optional parameters.

[[write]]
=== Write
`<sftp:write>`

Writes the content into the file pointed by path. If the directory on which the file is attempting to be written doesn't exist, then the operation will either throw SFTP:ILLEGAL_PATH error or create such folder depending on the value of the createParentDirectory. 

If the file itself already exists, then the behavior depends on the supplied mode. This operation also supports locking support depending on the value of the lock argument, but following the same rules and considerations as described in the read operation.

[[listener]]
=== On New File
`<sftp:listener>`

Polls a directory looking for files that have been created on it. One message is generated for each file that is found. The key part of this functionality is how to determine that a file is actually new. 

Possible polling strategies: 

* Set the autoDelete parameter to true: This deletes each processed file after it has been processed, causing all files obtained in the next poll to be necessarily new.
* Set moveToDirectory parameter: This moves each processed file to a different directory after it has been processed, achieving the same effect as autoDelete but without loosing the file.
* Use the watermarkMode parameter to only pick files that have been created/updated after the last poll was executed.

A matcher can also be used for additional filtering of files.

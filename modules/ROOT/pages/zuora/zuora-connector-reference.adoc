| Sort a| String a| This parameter restricts the order of the data returned in the response. You can use this parameter to supply a dimension you want to sort on.  

A sortable field uses the following form:

`operator field_name`

You can use at most two sortable fields in one URL path. Use a comma to separate sortable fields. 

For example:  `operator field_name, operator field_name`

`operator` is used to mark the order of sequencing. The operator is optional. If you only specify the sortable field without any operator, the response data is sorted in descending order by this field.

* The `-` operator indicates an ascending order.
* The `+` operator indicates a descending order.  By default, the response data displays in descending order by payment number.  `field_name` indicates the name of a sortable field. 

The supported sortable fields for this operation are:

* `accountId`
* `amount`
* `appliedAmount`
* `createdById`
* `createdDate`
* `creditBalanceAmount`
* `effectiveDate`
* `number`
* `refundAmount`
* `unappliedAmount`

| Configuration | String | The name of the configuration to use. | | x
| Created By Id a| String |  This parameter filters the response based on the `createdById` field. |  | 
| Created Date a| Date |  This parameter filters the response based on the `createdDate` field. |  | 
| Status a| String |  This parameter filters the response based on the `status` field. |  | 
| Target Date a| Date |  This parameter filters the response based on the `targetDate` field. |  | 
| Updated By Id a| String |  This parameter filters the response based on the `updatedById` field. |  | 
| Updated Date a| Date |  This parameter filters the response based on the `updatedDate` field. |  | 
| Sort a| String a| This parameter restricts the order of the data returned in the response. You can use this parameter to supply a dimension you want to sort on.

A sortable field uses the form: `operator field_name`

You can use at most two sortable fields in one URL path. Use a comma to separate sortable fields. 

For example:  `operator field_name, operator field_name`

`operator` marks the order of sequencing. The operator is optional. If you only specify the sortable field without any operator, the response data is sorted in descending order by this field.

* The `-` operator indicates an ascending order.
* The `+` operator indicates a descending order.  By default, the response data is displayed in descending order by refund number.  `field_name` indicates the name of a sortable field. 

The supported sortable fields for this operation are:

* `createdById`
* `createdDate`
* `status`
* `targetDate`
* `updatedById`
* `updatedDate`

Examples:

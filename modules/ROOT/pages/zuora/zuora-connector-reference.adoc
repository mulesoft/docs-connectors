| Configuration | String | The name of the configuration to use. | |x
| Fields Filterable a| String |  This parameter restricts the data returned in the response. You can use this parameter to supply a dimension you want to filter on.   A single filter uses the following form:  *fieldsFilterable* `=` *field_value*  Filters can be combined by using `&`. For example: *fieldsFilterable* `=` *field_value* & *fieldsFilterable* `=` *field_value*  *fieldsFilterable* indicates the name of a supported field that you can use to filter the response data. The supported filterable fields of this operation are as below:    - number   - status   - type   - accountId   - amount   - appliedAmount   - unappliedAmount   - refundAmount   - creditBalanceAmount   - currency   - effectiveDate   - createdDate   - createdById   - updatedDate   - updatedById   *field_value* indicates a valid value of the filterable field. If the type of the field value is string, you can set the field to `null` value for filtering. Then, you can get the response data with this field value being 'null'. For more information about these fields, see the field descriptions in the **Responses** section.  Examples:  - /payments?status=Processed  - /payments?currency=USD&status=Processed  - /payments?status=Processed&type=External&sort=+number |  |
| Sort a| String |  This parameter restricts the order of the data returned in the response. You can use this parameter to supply a dimension you want to sort on.  A sortable field uses the following form:  *operator* *field_name*  You can use at most two sortable fields in one URL path. Use a comma to separate sortable fields. For example:  *operator* *field_name*, *operator* *field_name*  *operator* is used to mark the order of sequencing. The operator is optional. If you only specify the sortable field without any operator, the response data is sorted in descending order by this field.    - The `-` operator indicates an ascending order.   - The `+` operator indicates a descending order.  By default, the response data is displayed in descending order by payment number.  *field_name* indicates the name of a sortable field. The supported sortable fields of this operation are as below:    - number   - accountId   - amount   - appliedAmount   - unappliedAmount   - refundAmount   - creditBalanceAmount   - effectiveDate   - createdDate   - createdById   - updatedDate   - updatedById  Examples:  - /payments?sort=+number  - /payments?status=Processed&sort=-number,+amount |  |

| Configuration | String | The name of the configuration to use. | |x
| Fields Filterable a| String |  This parameter restricts the data returned in the response. You can use this parameter to supply a dimension you want to filter on.   A single filter uses the following form:  *fieldsFilterable* `=` *field_value*  Filters can be combined by using `&`. For example: *fieldsFilterable* `=` *field_value* `&` *fieldsFilterable* `=` *field_value*  *fieldsFilterable* indicates the name of a supported field that you can use to filter the response data. The supported filterable fields of this operation are as below:    - id   - amount   - appliedAmount   - refundAmount   - sku   - skuName   - serviceStartDate   - serviceEndDate   - sourceItemId   - createdDate   - createdById   - updatedDate   - updatedById   - subscriptionId   *field_value* indicates a valid value of the filterable field. If the type of the field value is string, you can set the field to `null` value for filtering. Then, you can get the response data with this field value being 'null'. For more information about these fields, see the field descriptions in the **Responses** section.  Examples:  - /creditmemos/402890245c7ca371015c7cb40ac30015/items?amount=100  - /creditmemos/402890245c7ca371015c7cb40ac30015/items?amount=100&sort=createdDate |  |
| Sort a| String |  This parameter restricts the order of the data returned in the response. You can use this parameter to supply a dimension you want to sort on.  A sortable field uses the following form:  *operator* *field_name*  You can use at most two sortable fields in one URL path. Use a comma to separate sortable fields. For example:  *operator* *field_name*, *operator* *field_name*  *operator* is used to mark the order of sequencing. The operator is optional. If you only specify the sortable field without any operator, the response data is sorted in descending order by this field.    - The `-` operator indicates an ascending order.   - The `+` operator indicates a descending order.  By default, the response data is displayed in descending order by updated date.  *field_name* indicates the name of a sortable field. The supported sortable fields of this operation are as below:    - id   - amount   - appliedAmount   - refundAmount   - sku   - skuName   - serviceStartDate   - serviceEndDate   - sourceItemId   - createdDate   - createdById   - updatedDate   - updatedById   - subscriptionId  Examples:  - /creditmemos/402890245c7ca371015c7cb40ac30015/items?sort=createdDate  - /creditmemos/402890245c7ca371015c7cb40ac30015/items?amount=100&sort=createdDate |  |

| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Configuration | String | The name of the configuration to use. | |x
| Fields Filterable a| String |  This parameter restricts the data returned in the response. You can use this parameter to supply a dimension you want to filter on.  A single filter uses the following form:  *fieldsFilterable* `=` *field_value*  Filters can be combined by using `&`. For example: *fieldsFilterable* `=` *field_value* `&` *fieldsFilterable* `=` *field_value*  *fieldsFilterable* indicates the name of a supported field that you can use to filter the response data. The supported filterable fields of this operation are as below:    - targetDate   - status   - createdDate   - createdById   - updatedDate   - updatedById   *field_value* indicates a valid value of the filterable field. If the type of the field value is string, you can set the field to `null` value for filtering. Then, you can get the response data with this field value being `null`. For more information about these fields, see the field descriptions in the **Responses** section.  Examples:  - /payment-runs?status=Processed  - /payment-runs?targetDate=2017-10-10&status=Pending  - /payment-runs?status=Completed&sort=+updatedDate |  |
| Sort a| String |  This parameter restricts the order of the data returned in the response. You can use this parameter to supply a dimension you want to sort on.  A sortable field uses the following form:  *operator* *field_name*  You can use at most two sortable fields in one URL path. Use a comma to separate sortable fields. For example:  *operator* *field_name*, *operator* *field_name*  *operator* is used to mark the order of sequencing. The operator is optional. If you only specify the sortable field without any operator, the response data is sorted in descending order by this field.    - The `-` operator indicates an ascending order.   - The `+` operator indicates a descending order.  By default, the response data is displayed in descending order by payment run number.  *field_name* indicates the name of a sortable field. The supported sortable fields of this operation are as below:    - targetDate   - status   - createdDate   - createdById   - updatedDate   - updatedById  Examples:  - /payment-runs?sort=+createdDate  - /payment-runs?status=Processing&sort=-createdById,+targetDate |  |
| Page Size a| Number |  Number of rows returned per page. |  20 |
| Zuora Entity Ids a| String |  An entity ID.

Design Center enables you to create apps visually. To use Design Center, work with your Anypoint Platform administrator to ensure that you have a xref:access-management::environments.adoc#to-create-a-new-environment[Design environment]. For more information, see the xref:design-center::fd-tour.adoc[Flow Designer Tour].

To create an app in Design Center:

* Configure the input source (trigger) for your app.
* Add the connector as a component to process the input for the app.

== Configure the Trigger

. In Design Center, click *Create*.
. Click *Create new application*.
. Specify a value for *Project name*, and click *Create*.
. Exit from *Let's get started* by clicking *Go straight to canvas*.
. Click on the Trigger card.
. Search for and select *HTTP Listener* or *Scheduler*.
. Complete the fields with the values you want to configure for your trigger. For more information on field values, see the xref:zuora/zuora-connector-reference.adoc[Zuora Connector Reference].

== Configure the Zuora Target Component

To add a Zuora connector as a component:

. Click “+” next to the trigger card.
. In *Select a component*, search for the connector name.
. Select the Zuora, and then select an operation.
. Enter the required values in the *General* tab.
. If needed, enter values for other tabs.
. Click *Click here to set it up*.
. Specify access information to the connector resource. For this connector, you can use only Basic Authentication, as described below.
. If a *Test* button is available, click it to test the connection.

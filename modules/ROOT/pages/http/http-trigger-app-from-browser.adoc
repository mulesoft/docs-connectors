. Create a new project. In New Flow, in Trigger, select the HTTP Listener.
. In a Connector configuration, accept or change the existing CloudHub HTTP configuration. For example, accept the default CloudHub HTTP configuration:
+
* Protocol: HTTP
* Host: *0.0.0.0*
* Port: 8081
+
. In General, set Path to the path of the URL you plan to use to start the app from the browser. For example, set Path to */trigger*.
. In Advanced, set Allowed Methods to GET. Accept the other default settings and close the configuration.
. Click + and select Logger.
. In Logger, in Message, type "Hello"
. Click Deploy, and the execute the flow:
+
* Select Copy Link.
* Paste the link in a browser or client and type */trigger* at the end.
+
. In Design Center, click image:http/left-angle-bracket.png[logs].

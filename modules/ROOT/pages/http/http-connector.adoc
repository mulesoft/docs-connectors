Release Notes: xref:release-notes::connector/connector-http.adoc[HTTP Connector Release Notes]

The HTTP connector enables you to declare HTTP servers that listen to
requests and trigger flows, as well as HTTP clients that can communicate with any
HTTP service. This means that the HTTP connector effectively allows you to both
expose and consume HTTP based APIs. For example, APIkit and RESTConnect both use
the HTTP connector internally to work with APIs.

The HTTP connector also supports HTTPS (TLS) connectivity, provides easy ways to serve static
resources and secure servers, and handles a number of client authentication schemes.

=== About HTTP Servers

HTTP servers expose services for users or applications to consume. They
receive data in the form of requests and return a response. For the connector,
this means triggering flows when a request is received and responding once the
flow finishes. This is all handled by the HTTP Listener, a source the connector provides.

HTTP servers are declared by first defining an HTTP Listener connection, which defines the
host and port where requests are received.

For example:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<http:listener-config name="serverConfig">
  <http:listener-connection host="localhost" port="8081"/>
</http:listener-config>
----

In this example, the HTTP Listener configuration is named `serverConfig`. It listens on a computer's localhost address
(IP address `127.0.0.1`) and on port `8081`. After you set up a server in Anypoint Studio or Design Center,
you can access this server at the `+http://localhost:8081+` URL.

To fully configure your server, you can choose specific resource paths to execute a flow, so that when a request
matching that path is received, Mule runs your flow.

Consider the following example:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="hello">
    <http:listener path="greet" config-ref="serverConfig"/>
    <set-payload value="Hello, world!"/>
</flow>

<flow name="bye">
    <http:listener path="exit" config-ref="serverConfig"/>
    <set-payload value="Goodbye, world!"/>
</flow>
----

In these examples, two HTTP listeners are set up to use the previous configuration `serverConfig` that created
an HTTP server on the `localhost` and port `8081`. Depending on which path is triggered, different flows
will execute.

Thus, calling `+http://localhost:8081/greet+` returns `Hello, world!` while calling `+http://localhost:8081/exit+`
returns `Goodbye, world!`.

The received request data is shared with the flow when executed, and the responses
can be customized.

The next example uses the incoming HTTP request query parameters and customizes the body of its HTTP responses:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="hello">
  <http:listener path="greet" config-ref="serverConfig">
    <http:response>
      <http:body>
        #[payload ++ ' I am an HTTP server.']
      </http:body>
    </http:response>
  </http:listener>
  <set-payload value="#['Hello, ' ++ (attributes.queryParams.name default 'world') ++ '!']" />
</flow>
----

Considering the example above, now calling `+http://localhost:8081/greet?name=Ana+`
returns `Hello, Ana! I am an HTTP server.`, while calling `+http://localhost:8081/greet+`
returns `Hello, world! I am an HTTP server.`.

You can find a complete overview of the HTTP listener features in the xref:http/http-listener-ref.adoc[HTTP Listener Configuration Reference].

== About HTTP Clients

HTTP clients enable you to send requests to HTTP services and handle their responses. For
the connector, this means executing a request and returning the answer. This is
handled by the HTTP request, an operation that the connector provides.

HTTP clients don't necessarily need to be declared, though declaring them is recommended so you
can reuse configurations. If you don't declare an HTTP client, you need to specify the entire
URL each time you want to send a request. Although this configuration
is useful for quick requests, if you do several requests on different
API resources, it is best to declare the client specifying the host to connect to.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<http:request-config name="clientConfig">
  <http:request-connection host="localhost" port="8081"/>
</http:request-config>
----

In this example, the HTTP request configuration is named `clientConfig`. It sends requests to
`localhost` and port `8081`, the previously configured server.

To perform requests, each operation you use only needs to feature the path where it should go.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="helloAndBye">
  <http:request method="GET" path="greet" config-ref="clientConfig"/>
  <logger level="INFO" message="#[payload]"/>
  <http:request method="GET" path="exit" config-ref="clientConfig"/>
  <logger level="INFO" message="#[payload]"/>
</flow>
----

The previous examples consume the service exposed previously by sending requests to `greet` and `exit`. When the flow
executes, it displays:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
Hello, world! I am an HTTP server.
Goodbye, world!
----

The requests can be customized, and the response data is shared with the flow.

The next example customizes the request sent with query parameters and uses the received HTTP response status:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="fullHello">
  <http:request method="GET" path="greet" config-ref="clientConfig">
    <http:query-params>
      #[{"name" : "HTTP client"}]
    </http:query-params>
  </http:request>
  <logger level="INFO"
   message="#['Received a ' ++ attributes.status code ++ ' response with body: {' ++ payload ++ '}']"/>
</flow>
----

When this flow executes, it displays:

[source,xml]
----
Received a 200 response with body: {Hello, HTTP client! I am an HTTP server.}
----

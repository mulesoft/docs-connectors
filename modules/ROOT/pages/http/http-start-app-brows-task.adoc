In this procedure, you configure an HTTP Listener. You set an HTTP URL consisting of a host name, a port, and a path. To listen on a specific port for every network interface on the server, you set host to `0.0.0.0`. Using `localhost` listens for incoming requests generated inside the server. When the Listener hears the request in the browser, it initiates the app.

. Create a new project.
. From Mule Palette, drag an HTTP Listener to a new flow.
. Configure the Listener:
* Click + and set the default host, port and base path. For example, host = 0.0.0.0, port = 8081, and no base path.
* In General, set Path to the URL you plan to use to start the app from the browser. For example, set Path to */trigger*.
* Accept the other default Listener settings, and save the configuration.
+
. From the Mule Palette, drag Core > Logger to the flow.
. In Logger, in Message, type *"Hello"*.
+
. Deploy the app, open a browser, and go to `+http://0.0.0.0:8081/trigger+`.
+
The Listener hears the request on port 8081, and starts the app.
+
. In Console, scroll through the logs and you see Hello.

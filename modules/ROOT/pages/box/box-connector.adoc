Box Connector v4.0.1

== About Connectors

Anypoint connectors are Mule runtime engine extensions that enable you to connect to APIs and resources on external systems such as Box, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, and so forth.

Box is an online file sharing and content management service for businesses. The Anypoint Connector for Box is a RAML-based connector that provides synchronization of data and automation of processes between Box
and third party CRMs, CMS, mobile, and social applications. Because this is a RAML-based connector, it only uses REST calls to interact with the Box 2.0 API and supports only a subset of available API services.

== Prerequisites

Before creating an app, you must have access to the Box target resource and Anypoint Platform.
You must also understand how to create a Mule app using Anypoint Studio.

You should be familiar with the use of the Box 2.0 API, Mule, Anypoint Connectors, Anypoint Studio, Mule concepts, elements in a Mule flow, and global elements.

To use this connector you need the following:

* A developer account or other valid Box instance.
* MuleSoft Enterprise License and necessary entitlements.

== Audience

* Starting user -- To create your Mule app, see xref:box/box-connector-studio.adoc[Anypoint Studio].

The xref:box/box-connector-config-topics.adoc[Configuration Topics] topic helps extend your understanding of the Box connector.

Box is an online file sharing and content management service for businesses.
The Anypoint Connector for Box is a RAML based connector that provides synchronization of data and automation of processes between Box
and third party CRM, CMS, mobile, and social applications.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Box 2.0 API, Mule, Anypoint Connectors, Anypoint Studio, Mule concepts, elements in a Mule flow, and Global Elements.

To use this connector you need the following:

* A developer account or other valid Box instance.
* MuleSoft Enterprise License.

For hardware and software requirements and compatibility information, see the Connector Release Notes.


== What's New in this Connector

This version of the connector drops support for Mule 3.x and adds support for Mule 4.x.

This is a RAML based connector and only uses REST calls to interact with Box 2.0 API and only supports a subset of services available in it.

+
[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|Parameter|Description
|clientId|The client identifier as assigned by the authorization server when the client application was registered
|clientSecret|The client application's client secret
|host|The host where Box exposes its API
|port|The port at which Box services listen for incoming requests. Default: 443
|basePath|The base path of the Box services' base URI
|protocol|The protocol which Box services follow. Default: HTTPS
|localCallbackPath|The local callback path. Default: /callback
|localCallbackConfig|The HTTP Listener configuration that is used to configure the local authorization URL

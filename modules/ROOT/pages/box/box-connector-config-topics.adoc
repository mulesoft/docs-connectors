== Configure the Box Connector Global Element

To use the Box connector in a Mule application, configure a global Box configuration element that can be used by as many Box connectors as
needed for your application.

. Click the **Global Elements** tab at the base of the canvas.
. In the Global Configuration Elements screen, click **Create**.
. In the Choose Global Type wizard, expand Connector Configuration and select **Mule-box-connector Config** and click **Ok**.
The configuration screen for `OAUTH 2.0` with Authorization Code, grant type displays. This is the only configuration that Box connector supports.
. Configure the properties as described here.

|Parameter|Description
|clientId|The client identifier as assigned by the authorization server when the client application was registered.
|clientSecret|The client application's client secret.
|host|The host where Box exposes its API.
|port|The port at which Box services listen for incoming requests. Default: 443
|basePath|The base path of the Box services' base URI.
|protocol|The protocol which Box services follow. Default: HTTPS
|localCallbackPath|The local callback path. Default: /callback
|localCallbackConfig|The HTTP Listener configuration that is used to configure the local authorization URL.
|externalCallbackUrl|The redirect URL that is configured in the client application.
|localAuthorizationUrl|Local authorization URL that is used to initiate an `OAuth2` dance.
|authorizationUrl|The authorization URL to request for an authorization code.
|accessTokenUrl|The access token URL to request for an access token.
|===
+
In the `OAUTH 2.0` configuration screen, the placeholder values refer to a configuration file `mule-artifact.properties` placed in the
`src/main/resources` folder of your project.
+
You can either enter your credentials into the global configuration properties, or reference a configuration file that contains these values.
For simpler maintenance and better re-usability of your project, Mule recommends that you use a configuration file.
Keeping these values in a separate file is useful if you need to deploy to different environments, such as production, development, and QA, where your access credentials differ.
+
. Click **OK** to save the global connector configurations.

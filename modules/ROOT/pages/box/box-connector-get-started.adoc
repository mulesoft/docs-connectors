== About Connectors

Anypoint Connectors are extensions of Mule that let you work with external systems such as Box, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, Twitter, and more to send and receive information from these systems to create something new.
Anypoint Connectors let you connect Mule applications to APIs and resources.
A connector lets you send and receive data over a protocol, or to and from an API.
Use this information to work with Design Center or Anypoint Studio to adjust the UI settings to enable the connector to work with a Mule application.

Box is an online file sharing and content management service for businesses. The Anypoint Connector for Box is a RAML based connector that provides synchronization of data and automation of processes between Box

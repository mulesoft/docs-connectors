IBM MQ, previously known as WebSphere MQ, is messaging middleware that
allows communication between different components of a distributed application
to be loosely coupled, reliable, and asynchronous.
This connector makes usage of the JMS API provided by IBM MQ.

IBM MQ supports two models for messaging:

* Queues - Point-to-point

* Topics - Publish-subscribe

The IBM MQ connector lets you send and receive messages to queues and topics for
any message service that implements the JMS specification.

== Queues - Point-to-Point

In the point-to-point or queueing model, a sender posts messages to a
queue and a receiver reads messages from the queue. Here, the sender knows the
destination of the message and posts the message directly to the receiver’s queue.

In point-to-point:

* Only one consumer gets the message.

* The sender does not have to be running when the consumer consumes the
message, nor does the consumer need to be running when the message is sent.

* Every message successfully processed is acknowledged by the consumer.

== Topics - Publish-Subscribe

In the publish-subscribe model, a sender publishes messages to a message
topic. Subscribers may register interest in receiving messages on a
message topic. In this model, neither the publisher nor the subscriber know about
each other. A good analogy for this is an anonymous bulletin board.

In publish-subscribe:

* Multiple consumers (or none) receive the message.

* There is a timing dependency between publishers and subscribers. The publisher
has to create a message topic for clients to subscribe.

* The subscriber has to remain continuously active to receive messages, unless
it has established a durable subscription. In that case, messages published while
the subscriber is not connected, redistribute when it reconnects.

Request and reply is a widespread pattern between applications, thus the new IBM MQ
connector provides an operation for that, called `publish-consume`.
The publish-consume operation allows you to publish a message to any destination,
and then wait for a reply on a different destination.

When using the publish-consume operation, the JMSReplyTo header of the outgoing message
contains the ID of the destination at which an application waits for a
response. This destination may be a well-known destination, or it may be a
temporary destination created on the fly with the only purpose of receiving a
single response message.

The result of the operation is the message received as a response,
with the same structure as if a consume operation was invoked.

== Waiting For A Reply On A Temporary Queue

Using a temporary queue to wait for a response is very simple, just configure the
message being sent and the operation automatically waits for a response in a
temporary queue:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<ibm-mq:publish-consume
     config-ref="config"
     destination="targetDestination"
     maximumWait="20"
     maximumWaitUnit="SECONDS"/>
----

In this example, the operation publishes a message with the current payload
as its body and the JMSReplyTo header configured to a temporary destination,
to the `targetDestination`.
Then, it automatically tries to consume the response from that temporary
queue until a message is consumed or the maximumWait is reached (in which case
the operation fails with a IBM-MQ:TIMEOUT error).

== Receiving The Reply On A Known Queue

In many cases, reply queues do not need to be created for each request,
but instead a well-known queue is used for replies.
For this cases, all you have to do is to configure the `reply-to` parameter on
the outgoing message:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<ibm-mq:publish-consume config-ref="config"
     destination="targetDestination">
    <ibm-mq:message>
        <ibm-mq:reply-to destination="replyToDestination"/>
    </ibm-mq:message>
</ibm-mq:publish-consume>
----

The operation publishes a message to the `targetDestination` with the
current payload as its body and the JMSReplyTo header configured with
the `replyToDestination`.

The operation automatically tries to consume the response from the
replyToDestination queue until a message is consumed or the maximumWait
is reached (in which case tthe operation fails with a IBM-MQ:TIMEOUT error).

Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Connector v2.0

Release Notes: xref:release-notes::connector/ms-dynamics-ax-connector-release-notes-mule-4.adoc[Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Connector Release Notes]

== Default Configuration

=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | |x
| Connection a| Gateway Username Password
| The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | |x
| Expiration Policy a| ExpirationPolicy |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform expires the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime actually purges the instances as it sees fit. |  |
|===

== Gateway Username Password Connection Type

=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required

= Microsoft Dynamics AX Connector
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

endif::[]

The Microsoft Dynamics AX connector lets Mule applications interact with Microsoft Dynamics AX Query Service.

This connector supports the following operations:

* Run a query against an AOT table.
* Run an AOT static query.
* Call an AIF Document Service.

The connector supports Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule, Anypoint Connectors, Anypoint Studio, Mule concepts, elements in a Mule flow, and Global Elements.

You need login credentials to test your connection to your target resource.

For hardware and software requirements and compatibility
information, see the Connector Release Notes.

To use this connector with Maven, view the pom.xml dependency information in
the Dependency Snippets in Anypoint Exchange.

Install the Windows Gateway Services for Anypoint Platform.

=== Windows Gateway Services for Anypoint Platform

The Windows Gateway Services agent performs protocol translation when calling the Dynamics AX System Services.
The Dynamics AX System Services (Metadata Service, Query Service) use the net.tcp protocol which is not implemented in Java.
To execute requests, the connector routes the requests through the Windows Gateway Services as described below.

image::ms-dynamics/ms-dynamics-ax-protocol-translation.png[]

. The connector sends an HTTP request to the Windows Gateway Services.
. The Windows Gateway Services receives the HTTP request.
. The Windows Gateway Services executes the request against the Dynamics AX System Services using the netTcp protocol.
. The Windows Gateway Services receives the response from the Dynamics AX System Services.
. The Windows Gateway Services sends the response to the connector over HTTP.
. The connector receives the response.

All communication between the Anypoint Platform and Windows Gateway Services is authenticated and secured by SSL.

== What's New in this Connector

First Mule 4 release.

== To Connect in Design Center

. Click a trigger such as HTTP Listener or Scheduler.
+

+
. Click the plus sign and search for Dynamics Ax Connector and select Query Table Operation.
. Click Edit to configure the connector.
. For general settings, complete these fields:
+
** Company: Sets the company to use within all calls.
** Language: Sets the language to use within all calls.
** Log on as user: Sets the user to use within all calls.
** Message id: Sets the message ID to use within all calls.

+
Connection parameters:
+
[cols="2,7", options="header"]
|===
|Parameter
|Description

|Username
|The username to connect to Dynamics AX.

|Password
|The password to connect to Dynamics AX.

|AOS Server Name
|The name or IP of the server where the Application Object Server is running on.

|AOS Services WSDL Port
|The port number that the Services WSDL run on. Default is `8101`.

|Gateway Router Service Url
|The address (host and port) of the Windows Gateway Services. This address is usually similar to `+https://myserver.com:9333/router+`
|===
+
. For advanced connection complete these fields:
+
** AOS Endpoint Port (Optional) - Use this configuration to override the service endpoint that is in the services' WSDL document.
** Connection timeout - Used to set connection timeout for connector requests. This optional value is in milliseconds (0 for unlimited timeout).
** Receive timeout - Use to set reception timeout for connector requests. This optional value is in milliseconds.
+
. Complete the Query with: `dsql:SELECT Name,Type FROM ProjTable`
. Complete Fetch Size with: `20`

. Set Host to localhost and Port to 8080.
. Click OK.
. Add Query Table operation from Microsoft Dynamics AX pallette.
. Configure connection by clicking on the green plus sign
. Set the above mentioned fields
. Complete the Query parameter with `dsql:Select Name from ProjTable`
. Add a Transform Message and set it with following:
+
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/json
payload
----
+
. Perform a curl to `localhost:8080`

== Use Case XML

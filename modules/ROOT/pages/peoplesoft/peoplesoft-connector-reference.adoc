The PeopleSoft Connector provides real-time connectivity to query and update all PeopleSoft modules, using a common integration interface known as the Component Interface.

== Default Configuration

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
| Field |Description
|Name | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name.

Type: String +
Default: None +
Required: Yes
| Connection | The connection types that can be provided to this configuration.

Type: Connection +
Default: None +
Required: Yes
| Enable Edit History Items |

Type: Boolean +
Default: false +
Required: No
| Enable Get History Items |

Type: Boolean +
Default: false +
Required: No
| Enable Interactive Mode |

Type: Boolean +
Default: false +
Required: No
| Date format for the conversion| Format the connector uses to convert DateTime values to PeopleSoft. By default, the connector uses "MM/dd/yyyy K:mm:ssa" where MM : month , dd : day , yyyy : calendar year , K : hour , mm : minutes , ss : seconds , a : AM/PM . This format depends  on the Peoplesoft instance .

Type: String +
Default: "MM/dd/yyyy K:mm:ssa" +
Required: No
| Expiration Policy | Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform expires the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime purges the instances as needed.

Type: ExpirationPolicy +
Default: false +
Required: No

=== Associated Operation

* Invoke Operation


== Invoke Operation

`<peoplesoft:invoke-operation>`

Invokes a PeopleSoft operation depending on the type selected. DataSense discovers the structure of the entities in the system during design time and run time and uses the structure to perform the operation for the type selected. This varies for Find, Get, Create, and so on.

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
| Field |Description
| Configuration |The name of the configuration to use.

Type: String +
Default: None +
Required: Yes
| Content | A Map with the parameters to be used in the operation.

Type: Binary +
Default: #[payload] +
Required: No
| Streaming Strategy | Configure if repeatable streams should be used and their behavior.

Type: One of:

* repeatable-in-memory-stream
* repeatable-file-store-stream
* non-repeatable-stream

Default: #[payload] +
Required: No
| Component Name |

Type: String +
Default: None +
Required: Yes
| Operation |

Type: String +
Default: None +
Required: Yes
| Target Variable | The name of a variable in which the operation's output is placed.

Type: String +
Default: None +
Required: No
| Target Value | An expression to evaluate against the operation's output and the outcome of that expression is stored in the target variable.

Type: String +
Default: #[payload] +
Required: No
| Reconnection Strategy | A retry strategy in case of connectivity errors.

Type: One of:

* reconnect
* reconnect-forever

Default: None +
Required: No

== Types

=== Reconnection

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
| Field |Description
| Fails Deployment | When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to true, deployment fails if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy.

Type: Boolean +
Default: None +
Required: No
| Reconnection Strategy | The reconnection strategy to use.

Type: One of:

* reconnect
* reconnect-forever

Default: None +
Required: No
|===

[[reconnect]]
=== Reconnect

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
| Field |Description
| Frequency | How often (in ms) to reconnect.

Type: Number +
Default: None +
Required: No
| Count | How many reconnection attempts to make.

Type: Number +
Default: None +
Required: No
|===

[[reconnect-forever]]
=== Reconnect Forever

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
| Field |Description
| Frequency | How often (in ms) to reconnect.

Type: Number +
Default: None +
Required: No
|===

[[ExpirationPolicy]]
=== Expiration Policy

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
| Field | Description
| Max Idle Time | A scalar time value for the maximum amount of time a dynamic configuration instance should be allowed to be idle before it's considered eligible for expiration.

Type: Number +
Default: None +
Required: No
| Time Unit | A time unit that qualifies the maxIdleTime attribute.

Possible values:

* NANOSECONDS
* MICROSECONDS
* MILLISECONDS
* SECONDS
* MINUTES
* HOURS
* DAYS

Type: Enumeration +
Default: None +
Required: No
|===

[[repeatable-in-memory-stream]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Stream

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
| Field |Description
| Initial Buffer Size | This is the amount of memory to allocate to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can be fit into this buffer, then the buffer expands according to the bufferSizeIncrement attribute, with an upper limit of maxInMemorySize.

Type: Number +
Default: None +
Required: No
| Buffer Size Increment | This is by how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower  means that the buffer should not expand, meaning that a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised when the buffer gets full.

Type: Number +
Default: None +
Required: No
| Max Buffer Size | This is the maximum amount of memory to use. If more than that is used, then a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised. A value lower or equal to zero means no limit.

Type: Number +
Default: None +
Required: No
| Buffer Unit | The unit in which maxInMemorySize is expressed.

Possible values:

* BYTE
* KB
* MB
* GB

Type: Enumeration +
Default: None +
Required: No
|===

[[repeatable-file-store-stream]]
=== Repeatable File Store Stream

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
| Field |Description
| Max In Memory Size | Defines the maximum memory that the stream should use to keep data in memory. If more than that is consumed, it starts to buffer the content on disk.

Type: Number +
Default: None +
Required: No
| Buffer Unit | The unit in which maxInMemorySize is expressed.

Possible values:

* BYTE
* KB
* MB
* GB

Type: Enumeration +

A *Global Element* is a reusable object containing parameters that any number of elements in a flow can share. You typically reference a global element from Anypoint Connectors in your Mule app project.

Use the global element to apply configuration details to multiple _local_ elements in flows. Create one _global_ element that details your connection, configuration or transport details. Simply reference the global element from any flow element that should use those same parameters. That way you can ensure consistency across flow elements.

When the parameters of the applicable flow elements must change, just change the details from the global element they reference.

Before venturing further into this topic, review the features of the xref:studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio] to learn more about developing Mule applications using the Anypoint Studio graphical user interface and to understand the context in which global elements are used.

[[advantages]]
== Advantages

Global elements provide a number of benefits to you as a Mule application developer.

=== Reusability

You can configure a global element just once, and share that configuration among processors of the same type. This is particularly useful when you have to define the connection details and login credentials for an external source, such as a SaaS application or database.

=== Efficiency

Rather than changing the same configuration multiple times within many like processors (for example, multiple connectors that hook into the same service, using one set of credentials) throughout the Mule flow, you can change the configuration once in the global element, and the changes apply to all Mule flow elements that reference the global element.

=== Flexibility

An element in a Mule flow can apply a global element’s configuration exactly as defined, or complement the global configuration properties.

== How to Create a Global Element

Some components require that their properties be stored in a global element.
In any case, you can use global elements for the <<advantages,Advantages>> listed in the previous section.

// I don't know about including all of the below. This is probably documented in Studio?

=== Anypoint Studio Visual Editor

. In the Anypoint Studio Visual Editor, click the *Global Elements* tab at the base of the canvas to access a list of all global elements in an application.
+
image::global-element-create-annot.png[GEtab]
+
. Click *Create* to add a new global element.
. In the *Choose Global Type* wizard, navigate the directories or use the filter to select the _type_ of global element you wish to create, then click *OK*.
. Define the configurable parameters of your global element in the *Global Element Properties* window that appears, then click *OK* to save.
+
[TIP]
====
*_To create a new global element from within a local element you placed in your flow:_*

. Click one of the pieces of your flow whose global element you want to create/configure. A box should appear around the element in the flow -- take for instance, an IMAP connector that has been clicked on:
+
image::global-elements-be086.png[imap example selected]
+
. In the properties pane that appears below the canvas, click the plus icon next to the *Connector Configuration* or similar reference field dropdown menu. (Click the Edit icon to edit an existing global element you may have already created.)
+
image::connector-configuration.png[connectorconfiguration]
. Fill in the required fields for the type of global element you set out to create.

=== XML Editor or Standalone

. In the XML Editor in Studio, or other text editor, open your XML configuration file for your Mule application.
. Create a global element for your Mule flow element _above and outside_ any <flow> you may have defined already in your application.
. Define the attribute values that your local element will reference, within the global element you create.
. To configure a _local_ element in the flow to reference a _global_ element, add a `config-ref` or `connector-ref` attribute inside the _local_ element, which appears inside the `<flow>`. The example below has a global element for the Salesforce connector (`sfdc:config`)
. The flow includes a Salesforce connector (`sfdc:create`) that references the global Salesforce element, named "Salesforce1":
`<sfdc:create config-ref="Salesforce1" type="" doc:name="Salesforce Connector">`

== Name Attribute for Security Manager Global Element

Although not required by the Mule runtime, the `name` attribute for the security manager global element is now required in Anypoint Studio as of version 6.0.0.
If you are coding by hand in Anypoint Studio, be sure to define the `name` attribute  on the security-manager element to suppress errors that may be reported by Studio.


== Global Element Examples

=== Example 1 - Global Element to Append a String

[TIP]
If you find that you need to append the same string multiple times at various points in a flow, you might store such a piece of functionality inside a global element for a *Transformer* of type *Append String*, where the *Message* field would be where you store your string to append.

=== Example 2 - Global Element for an HTTP Listener

Let's see how to configure a global element for a typical HTTP listener you might test in an app you run locally in Studio, using its embedded Mule runtime engine.

. Drag the HTTP listener onto the Anypoint Studio canvas to begin creating its global element. Select it with your mouse.
+
image::global-elements-1692e.png[http listener snapshot]
+
. After clicking the HTTP listener in the flow, you see the HTTP listener pane at bottom. From there, focus in and click the plus sign.
+
image::connector-configuration.png[connectorconfiguration]
+
. Configure the HTTP listener to listen for HTTP requests; in this case, `localhost`, port `8081`
+
image::global-elements-c1536.png[]
+
. Returning to the main HTTP listener pane, we see our HTTP listener references the global element by name in the *Connector Configuration* dropdown.
+
image::global-elements-1259f.png[]

[NOTE]
In reality an app would not suffice with only an HTTP listener, however it is a widely used piece of functionality in Mule applications that you will naturally get used to setting up.

=== XML View

Global element XML structure for the HTTP listener is as follows. The required fields for this connector's global element are `name`, `host` and `port`.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<http:listener-config name="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" host="localhost" port="8081" doc:name="HTTP Listener Configuration">
----

[IMPORTANT]
If you are coding by hand, notice the global element is defined _outside and above_ the `<flow>` that references it.

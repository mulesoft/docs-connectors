[[default-subscriber]]
== Default Subscriber Configuration

=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | |x
| Connection a| <<default-subscriber_connection, Connection>>
| The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | |x
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform expires the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime only purges the instances when needed. |  |
| Acknowledgment Mode a| Enumeration, one of:

** IMMEDIATE
** AUTO
** MANUAL |  Acknowledgment mode to use for the messages retrieved from the subscribers. |  AUTO |
| Acknowledgment Timeout a| Number |  Duration that a message is held by a broker waiting for an Acknowledgment or Not Acknowledgment. After that duration elapses, the message is again available to any subscriber. |  0 |
| Polling Time a| Number |  How much time in milliseconds to wait when requested messages are not ready to be consumed. |  10000 |
| Max Redelivery a| Number |  Number of redeliveries to try in case message processing fails. To avoid a poison message, the default value is set to -1 (infinite). |  -1 |
| Fetch Size a| Number |  Number of messages to receive when asking for messages. The response can contain fewer messages than this number depending on the poolingTime set. |  10 |
| Fetch Timeout a| Number |  Maximum duration in milliseconds to wait for the required amount of messages. If this duration elapses, the response is sent with as many messages as received during the period. |  1000 |
| Frequency a| Number |  Duration in milliseconds to execute the retrieve operation when the prefetch queue is not empty. | 5000 |

| TCP Client Socket Properties a| <<TcpClientSocketParameterGroup>> |  |  |
| TLS Context a| <<TLS, Tls>> |  |  |
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to true, deployment fails if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy. |  |

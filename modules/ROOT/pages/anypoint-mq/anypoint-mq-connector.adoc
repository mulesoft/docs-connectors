The Anypoint MQ connector provides publish-subscribe messaging to Mule applications using the Anypoint MQ cloud service.

Anypoint MQ supports a wide range of messaging use cases: enterprise messaging patterns, asynchronous communications between microservices, IoT, and more. Anypoint MQ also has a REST API for publishing or consuming messages using any framework such as node.js, Java, Go, and devops bash scripts.

For more information, see the xref:mq::index.adoc[Anypoint MQ documentation set] and additional resources listed in <<See Also>>.

== Prerequisites

To use this connector, you should be familiar with Anypoint Studio, Anypoint connectors, and Mule flows. The Anypoint MQ connector is free, but connecting to the service in Anypoint Platform requires a license. Free trial software is available.

. In Anypoint Platform, click MQ > Client Apps. If needed, create a client app.
. Copy the Anypoint Platform > MQ > Client App > Client App ID value to the Studio Client ID field.
. Copy the Client App > Client Secret value to the Studio Client Secret field. You can ignore the other settings to test your  connector.
. Click OK.
. Click the Operation field and specify an operation such as Publish or Consume.
. If using the Publish or Consume operations, specify the *Destination* as the name of the queue or message exchange that you set in Anypoint Platform.
. For the Publish operation, you can leave the Message ID field empty, or specify a message ID if you want to publish a specific message ID. If a message ID is not set, MQ auto generates a unique message ID for each message thatâ€™s sent to a queue. When publishing to FIFO queues, if you specify a Message ID and the Message ID is the same on multiple messages, the messages with the same Message ID are not redelivered.

Possible operations are:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Operation |Description
|xref:anypoint-mq/anypoint-mq-publish.adoc[Publish] |Publishes messages
to a queue or message exchange.
|xref:anypoint-mq/anypoint-mq-consume.adoc[Consume] |Consumes messages from a queue.
|xref:anypoint-mq/anypoint-mq-listener.adoc[Subscribe] |Waits for messages from a queue.
|xref:anypoint-mq/anypoint-mq-ack.adoc[Ack] |Indicates that the message has been consumed correctly and deletes the message from in-flight status.
|xref:anypoint-mq/anypoint-mq-ack.adoc[Nack] |Changes the status of the message from in-flight to in-queue to be consumed again by a subscriber.

== Example: MQ Bridge with DataWeave

The following example illustrates the use of the Anypoint MQ connector with DataWeave to transform
a message to JSON:

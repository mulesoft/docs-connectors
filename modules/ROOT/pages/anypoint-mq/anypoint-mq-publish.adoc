= Publish Messages

The Publish operation in the Anypoint MQ connector lets you create a new Anypoint MQ message and send it to the specified destination, be it a queue, FIFO queue, or a message exchange. With it, you can configure not only the content of the message, but also all the headers and properties you need.

== Send a Message

When used in its default form, the connector publishes whatever is in its message payload:

[source,xml]
----
<anypoint-mq:publish destination="invoiceQueue" config-ref="MQ_config"/>
----

But what happens if the payload is not in the correct format, and you actually need to make a transformation? You can place a DataWeave transformation before the `publish` operation, but that would cause the message payload to change and impact the operation placed after the `publish` operation.

To avoid this undesired impact, you can now place the transformation inside the `publish` operation:

[source,console,linenums]
----
<anypoint-mq:publish destination="invoiceQueue" config-ref="MQ_config">
  <anypoint-mq:body>#[%dw 2.0
   output application/json
   ---
   payload.payments
   ]</anypoint-mq:body>
</anypoint-mq:publish>
----

The transformation can be used for generating the content that is published, without producing a side effect on the message in transit.

== Configure User Properties

Every Anypoint MQ message can have a set of properties, which can be used in many different ways, such as to provide compatibility with other messaging systems or to communicate the content-type of a message.
The `publish` operation allows you to configure these properties directly in the message.

When you need to set a property for an outgoing message, you can use the `properties` element in the message:

[source,console,linenums]
----
<anypoint-mq:publish config-ref="MQ_config" destination="${bridgeDestination}" 
                     properties="#[{AUTH_TYPE: 'jwt', AUTH_TOKEN: attributes.queryParams.token}]">
    <anypoint-mq:body>#["bridged_" ++ payload]</anypoint-mq:body>
</anypoint-mq:publish>
----

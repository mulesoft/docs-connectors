For more information, see the xref:design-center::fd-tour.adoc[Flow Designer Tour].

To create an app in Design Center:

* Configure the input source (trigger) for your app.
* Add the connector as a component to process the input for the app.

. In Design Center, click a trigger. You can create an input source by selecting this connector as the trigger.
If a global element is not needed, you can use an HTTP Listener or Scheduler trigger.

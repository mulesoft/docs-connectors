Design Center enables you to create apps visually. To use Design Center, 
work with your Anypoint Platform administrator to ensure that you have 
a xref:access-management::environments.adoc#to-create-a-new-environment[Design environment]. 
For more information, see the xref:design-center::fd-tour.adoc[Flow Designer Tour].

To create an app in Design Center:

* Configure the input source (trigger) for your app.
* Add the connector as a component to process the input for the app.

For information on Design Center field values, see 
the xref:workday/workday-connector-reference.adoc[Workday Connector Reference]. 

// Ensure that the connector reference xref and title are correct.

== Configure the Input Source Trigger

. In Design Center, click *Create*.
. Click *Create new application*.
. Specify a value for *Project name*, and click *Create*.
. Click *Go straight to canvas* to exit from *Let's get started*. 
. Click the trigger card.
. If you are using your connector as an input source trigger, search for the connector; 
otherwise, you can use HTTP or Scheduler.
. Complete these fields when using *New objects trigger* as an input source trigger: 
// If <connector> has one or more source operations, list the 
// important and required fields and their values in a table.

= File Locking

File system level locks are not possible in FTP or SFTP, so the the operation uses a Mule lock that only protects the file from other flows in the same Mule app. It does not protect the file from external processes. However, if the Mule app is running on a cluster, the lock will be distributed.

The lock is automatically released when one of the following  occurs:

* The Mule flow that locked the file ends.
* The file content has been fully read.

Note that if the file is already locked by someone else, the connector will not be able to lock it, and you will receive a `FTP:FILE_LOCK` error.

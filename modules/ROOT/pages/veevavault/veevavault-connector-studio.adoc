= VeevaVault Connector Studio Configuration - Mule 4
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]


Add VeevaVault Connector to a Mule project in Anypoint Studio, configure an input source for the Mule flow, and configure the connector. Anypoint Studio provides two ways to add the connector to your Studio project: 

* From the Exchange button in the Studio taskbar
* From the Mule Palette view  

To configure a connector in Anypoint Studio:

. Add the connector to your Studio project
. Configure an input source for the flow
. Configure the connector


== Installing AnyPoint Studio

Before installing Studio, install the following components:

* https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Java]
* https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Apache Maven]

. Download https://docs.mulesoft.com/studio/7.3/to-download-and-install-studio[Anypoint Studio] and install it.
. Configure Maven:
[loweralpha]
.. Under the *Anypoint Studio* (Mac or Linux) or *Window* (Windows) menu, click *Preferences > Anypoint Studio > Maven*.
.. Click *Browse* to locate the folder where you installed Maven.
.. Click *Test Maven Configuration*. 
.. When the green checkmark appears, click *OK*.

== Add the Connector Using Exchange

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. Click the Exchange icon *(X)* in the upper-left of the Studio task bar.
. In Exchange, click *Login* and supply your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. In Exchange, search for "VeevaVault".
. Select VeevaVault Connector and click *Add to project*.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

== Add the Connector in Studio

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. In the Mule Palette view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Modules to Project*, type "VeevaVault" in the search field.
. In *Available modules*, click *VeevaVault Connector* and click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

== Configure an Input Source for the Flow

Configure an input source for the flow, such as HTTP Connector - *HTTP Listener*, or *Scheduler*.

== Configure the Connector

To use VeevaVault Connector in your Mule app, configure a global VeevaVault element that can be used by all VeevaVault Connector operations in the application.

. To create a global element for the connector, click the *Global Elements* tab at the base of the canvas, and then click *Create*.
+
. In the *Choose Global Type* window, expand *Connector Configuration*, click *Veeva Vault Config*, and click *OK*.
+
. In the Veeva Vault Config window, in the *General* tab, enter the configuration values:
+

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|*Field* |*Description*
|*Name* |Enter a name for this configuration to reference it later.
|*Vault URL* |Enter the Veeva Vault instance URL.
|*Username* |Enter the Veeva Vault instance username.
|*Password* |Enter the password that corresponds to the username.
|*Version* |Enter the Veeva Vault instance version.
|*Client Id* |Enter the client ID to send with each request in the header for tracking purposes, in the format: `\{organisation}-{company\|team}`. +
The client ID is prefixed with "mulesoft" and has a suffix with "client-vaultconnector" internally, for example: `mulesoft-abcpharma-clinicalprod-client-vaultconnector`. 
|===
+
In the previous image, the placeholder values refer to a configuration file placed in the folder (`src/main/resources`) of your project. You can either hardcode your credentials into the global configuration properties or reference a configuration file that contains these values. +
For simpler maintenance and better reusability of your project, using a configuration file is recommended. Keeping these values in a separate file is useful if you need to deploy to different environments, such as production, development, and QA, where your access credentials differ. +
The following is an example snippet of the `configuration.yaml` file under the `src/main/resources/config` folder:
+
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
	#Veeva Vault details
	veeva:
		vaultURL: "https://xxxx-xxxx.veevavault.com"
		username: "someone@example.com"
		password: "xxxxxxx"
		version : "v19.1"
		clientId: "mulesoft-abcpharma-clinicalprod-client-vaultconnector"
----
+
The connection configuration performs basic authentication, which accepts the required Vault URL, username, and password parameters to connect to the Veeva Vault instance to retrieve the session. The retrieved session is used for each operation configured in the Mule application for sending requests.
. In the Veeva Vault Config window, *Advanced* tab, configure the burst API limit.
+
image::veevavault/veevavault-connector-basic-authentication-advanced.png[]
+
*Burst API Limit Profile*
+
The burst API limit profile configuration to act upon if the specified burst API limit of the Veeva Vault API reaches the threshold of the configured value or is exceeded.
+
If *Burst API Limit Exceed Profile* is enabled (default), then the connector evaluates the Veeva Vault API's response header (`X-VaultAPI-BurstLimitRemaining`) value with the specified API Limit threshold value. If the remaining burst API limit reaches or exceeds this threshold value, the connector waits for the specified wait time to roll over the Burst Limit Remaining in five-minute windows.
+
The following is an example from the application logs showing a warning message at `2019-06-06 10:34:45,096` and subsequently waiting for five minutes before rerunning as shown in the next message at `2019-06-06 10:39:45,098`:

|*Field* |*Description*
|*API Limit Threshold* |Enter the VeevaVault API threshold limit. When this threshold is reached or exceeded, the connector waits the specified time. The default is `200`.
|*Wait Time* |Enter the amount of time the connector should wait if the API limit threshold is reached or exceeded. The default is `5`.
|*Time Unit* |Select the time unit for the wait time. The default is `MINUTES`.

*Daily API Limit Exceed Profile:*
+
The daily API limit exceed profile configuration (*Connector Configuration > Advanced Tab*) to act upon if the daily API limit of the Veeva Vault API reaches or exceeded or the configured threshold. The daily limit is the total number of API calls within any 24-hour window on a daily rolling basis.
+
If the *Daily API Limit Exceed Profile* is enabled (default), then the connector evaluates the Veeva Vault API's response header (*X-VaultAPI-DailyLimitRemaining*) for the specified value of the threshold, and throws an exception indicating the daily API limit is exceeded. The exception continues to be thrown for each and every job or request created until the daily limit is reset or rolled over the next day.
+
Below is an example log recorded which shows warning at *2019-06-06 10:47:31,698*, then an error is thrown at *2019-06-06 10:47:31,699*.

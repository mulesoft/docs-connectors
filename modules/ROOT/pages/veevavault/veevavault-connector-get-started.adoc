Veeva Vault Connector Version 1.1.0

Anypoint Connector for Veeva Vault (VeevaVault Connector) enables you to connect Mule flows to the Veeva Vault platform using the Veeva Vault REST API.

This connector works with the https://developer.veevavault.com/api/19.1/#authentication[Veeva Vault REST, Bulk, and Streaming API], depending on the operations you configure. Each API call uses a JSON/CSV request and returns JSON input stream responses over an HTTPS connection. All required request headers, error handling, and HTTPS connection configurations are built into the connector.

You can use VeevaVault Connector in Mule applications as an outbound connector with CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete), Query, Export, and Spark Validator operations on the following Veeva Vault objects:

* Documents: Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete, Export
* Document Renditions: Create, Retrieve, Delete
* Vault Object: Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete
* Picklists: Retrieve
* Audit Trail: Retrieve
* Query: VQL Query to query on Documents, Vault Object, Workflows
* Spark Validator: Validates and verifies the Spark message with signature that is triggered from Veeva Vault

You can configure VeevaVault Connector using Basic Authentication with credentials to connect to a Veeva Vault instance and perform operations.

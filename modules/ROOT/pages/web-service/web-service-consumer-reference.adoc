Web Service Consumer Connector Version 1.4

Web Service Consumer extension used to consume SOAP web services.


== Configurations
---
[[config]]
=== Default Configuration


Default configuration.


==== Parameters
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x
| Connection a| <<config_connection, Connection>>
 | The connection types to provide to this configuration. | | x
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform expires the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime purges the instances when it sees fit. |  | 
|===

==== Connection Types

===== Connection


`ConnectionProvider` that returns instances of `SoapClient`.

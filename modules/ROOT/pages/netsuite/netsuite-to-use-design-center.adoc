== To Connect in Design Center

. In Design Center, click Set Up > Upload, browse for and select the driver for this connector on your file system, and upload it. Alternatively, search for and select a driver that is already uploaded.
. Click a trigger. You can create a global element by selecting this connector as they trigger.
If a global element is not needed, you can use an HTTP Listener or Scheduler trigger.

+
. To create an HTTP global element for the connector, set these fields:
+
image::netsuite/netsuite-http-listener.png[HTTP Listener configuration]
+
.. Protocol: Protocol selected for the HTTP endpoint, it can be HTTP or HTTPS (secure).
.. Host: IP address where this Mule Application listens requests.
.. Port: Port address where this Mule Application listens requests.
.. Base Path: path where this Mule Application listens requests.
. Select the plus sign to add a component.
+

+
. Select the connector as a component.
. Select an authentication mechanism listed on the Global connector configuration. It can be one of the following:
+
[%header,cols="40%,60%"]
|===
|Configuration |Description
|Login Authentication |Makes use of the SuiteTalk's login API call on the first request sent by the connector to establish a session with NetSuite.
|Request Based Authentication |Using this strategy, you can send user credentials in the SOAP header of each request instead of authenticating to NetSuite by invoking login.
|Single Sign-On Authentication |This is a token based authentication system that avoids the use of environment username and password. Here you supply a privateKey together with other information. The connector is then responsible for generating an authentication token and establishing a session with NetSuite via the `ssoLogin` API call on the first request.
|Token Authentication |Similar to Single Sign-On Login Authentication, this is a token based authentication system. However, instead of using a privateKey generated via OpenSSL, this uses a consumer and token key/secret pairs which are established within the NetSuite environment.

. Configure the fields according your selection.

=== Login Authentication

[%header,cols="30%,70%"]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|Name |Enter a name for the configuration with which to reference later.
|Email |Enter the login email of the NetSuite user interface.
|Password |Enter the corresponding password to log in the NetSuite user interface.
|Account |Enter the account ID of the SuiteTalk NetSuite web services. This is usually found within NetSuite sandbox UI under Setup > Integration > Web Service Preferences.
|Role Id |Enter the role ID for the user in SuiteTalk, which determines the Processor privileges.
|Application Id |Enter the application ID corresponding to the Integration record to be used.
|===

=== Request Based Authentication

[%header,cols="30%,70%"]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|Name |Enter a name for the configuration with which to reference it later.
|Email |Enter the login email of the NetSuite user interface.
|Password |Enter the corresponding password to log into the NetSuite user interface.
|Account |Enter the account ID of the SuiteTalk NetSuite web services. This is usually found within NetSuite sandbox user interface under Setup > Integration > Web Service Preferences.
|Role Id |Enter the role ID for the user in SuiteTalk, which determines the Processor privileges.
|Application Id |Enter the application ID corresponding to the integration record to use.
|===

=== SSO Authentication

[%header,cols="30%,70%"]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|Name |Enter a name for the configuration so it can be referenced later.
|Partner Id |Enter the partner ID used in the mapping process.
|Partner Account |Enter the account ID of the SuiteTalk NetSuite web services.
|Company ID |Enter the company ID used in the mapping process for the connector to generate a token.
|User ID |Enter the user ID used in the mapping process for the connector to generate a token.
|Key File |Enter the privateKey file name to pick up from the project. This file should be the DER file generated as per NetSuite’s specifications. This is used to encrypt the company ID and user ID into a token for ssoLogin.
|Application Id |Enter the application ID corresponding to the Integration record to be used.
|===

=== Token Authentication

[%header,cols="30%,70%"]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|Consumer Key |Enter the consumer key value for the token based authentication enabled integration record being used.
|Consumer Secret |Enter the consumer secret value for the token based authentication enabled integration record being used.
|Token ID |Enter the token ID representing the unique combination of a user and integration generated within the NetSuite environment.
|Token Secret |Enter the respective token secret for the user/integration pair.
|Account |Enter the account ID of the SuiteTalk NetSuite web services. This is usually found within the NetSuite sandbox user interface under Setup > Integration > Web Service Preferences.
|Signature algorithm | Type of HMAC signature algorithm

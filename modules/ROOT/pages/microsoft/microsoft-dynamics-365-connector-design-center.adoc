The Flow Designer feature of Design Center enables you to create apps visually. To use Flow Designer, 
work with your Anypoint Platform administrator to ensure that you have 
a xref:access-management::environments.adoc#to-create-a-new-environment[Design environment]. 
For more information, see the xref:design-center::fd-tour.adoc[Flow Designer Tour].

To create an app in Flow Designer:

* Configure the input source (trigger) for your app.
* Add the connector as a component to process the input for the app.

For information on Flow Designer field values, see 
the xref:microsoft-dynamics-365/microsoft-dynamics-365-connector-reference.adoc[Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connector Reference]. 

// Ensure that the connector reference xref and title are correct.

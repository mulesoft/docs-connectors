= Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations Connector
:imagesdir: _images

The Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations Connector for Anypoint platform enables integration with Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations Web API.

This connector lets you perform these operations:
Authorize or unauthorize access to a Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations server.
Create a recurring job on Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations server.
Retrieve multiple entities.
Retrieve multiple entities using the DataSense Query Language.
Execute operations.

Release Notes:Â link:/release-notes/microsoft-dynamics-365-operations-release-notes[Microsoft Dynamics 365 Operations Connector Release Notes]

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule, Anypoint Connectors, Anypoint Studio, Mule concepts, elements in a Mule flow, and Global Elements.

You need login credentials to test your connection to your target resource.

For hardware and software requirements and compatibility information, see the Connector Release Notes.

To use this connector with Maven, view the pom.xml dependency information in the Dependency Snippets in Anypoint Exchange.

Before starting, you need access to a Microsoft Dynamics 365 instance (online or on-premise) managed by Azure Active Directory.

== What's New in this Connector

Microsoft Dynamics 365 For Operations 2.1.0

=== New and improved error types
. TIMEOUT - This error code will be thrown when either Connection Timeout or Read Timeout parameters have reached their threshold.
. INVALID_INPUT - This error code will be thrown in case of a malformed request. (e.g. Trying to execute Retrieve Multiple By Query with an invalid column name.)
. NOT_FOUND - This error code may be thrown from any operation. (e.g. Trying to use Execute Operation with an invalid service name.)

=== Refresh token mechanism

A refresh token mechanism was added for the OAuth Password Grant Type Connection that will refresh the token automatically when it expires, without the user being required to configure the reconnection parameters in the connector configuration. This implies that when the token expires it will be automatically refreshed by the connector but when there is a connection issue(for example the internet connection was lost), if the reconnection strategy is configured, reconnection will be handled by the runtime and the strategy must be configured by the user.

== Connect in Design Center
. In Design Center, click Set Up > Upload, browse for and select the driver for this connector on your file system, and upload it.
Alternatively, search for and select a driver that is already uploaded.
. Click a trigger. You can create a global element by selecting this connector as they trigger.
If a global element is not needed, you can use an HTTP Listener or Scheduler trigger.
. To create an optional global element for the connector, you can choose from the following options:
+

. Select the plus sign to add a component.
. Select the connector as a component.
. Configure these fields for Retrieve multiple operation:
... Data Query URL - Dynamics for Operations query to be used for retrieving data.

=== Required Parameters for the OAuth 2.0 Configuration
For information regarding required configuration, visit: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-protocols-oauth-code
In order to find the authorization url and the access token url you can go to the Azure portal, App registrations section and select the Endpoints menu.

. Consumer Key - The application ID assigned to your app when you registered it with Azure Active Directory. You can find this in the Azure Portal (portal.azure.com). Click Active Directory, click the directory, choose the application, and click Configure.
. Consumer Secret - The application secret that you created in the app registration portal for your app. This should not be used in a native app, because client secrets cannot be reliably stored on devices. This is required for web apps and web APIs, which have the ability to store the client secret securely on the server side. You can find this in the Azure Portal (portal.azure.com).
. Authorization url - Tenant specific OAuth2.0 endpoint; format: https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/authorize (follow instructions presented in the above link for specific information on how to obtain the endpoint)
. Access token url - Tenant specific endpoint for requesting the access token; format: https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/token (follow instructions presented in the above link for specific information on how to obtain the endpoint)
. Listener config - Name of the http listener instance created in studio flow
. Callback path - The url of your app, where authentication responses can be sent and received by your app. (follow instructions presented in the above link for specific information on how to obtain the endpoint)
. Authorize path - The url which triggers the OAuth mechanism
. External callback url - Optional: configure this if the callback url is not accesible directly (example: when using proxies) example format: http://localhost:8081/callback
+

=== Required Parameters for the OAuth 2.0 Username-Password
For information regarding required configuration, visit: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-protocols-oauth-code

. Username - Username used to initialize the session.
. Password - Password used to authenticate the user.
. Resource - The application ID URI of the web API (secured resource). This must be the root URI, without specifing the version. Example: `+https://YOUR_ORG.operations.dynamics.com/+`
. Client ID - The application ID assigned to your app when you registered it with Azure Active Directory. You can find this in the Azure Portal (portal.azure.com). Click Active Directory, click the directory, choose the application, and click Configure.
. Client Secret - The application secret that you created in the app registration portal for your app. This should not be used in a native app, because client secrets cannot be reliably stored on devices. This is required for web apps and web APIs, which have the ability to store the client secret securely on the server side. You can find this in the Azure Portal (portal.azure.com).
. Token Request Endpoint - The token endpoint that is called to get the access token. Example: `+https://login.windows.net/TENANT_ID/oauth2/token+` where TENANT_ID is the Azure Active Directory ID.

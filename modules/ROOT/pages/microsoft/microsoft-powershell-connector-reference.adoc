| Connection a| * Linux Configuration
* Windows Configuration
 | The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | |x
| Expiration Policy a| ExpirationPolicy |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform expires the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime purges instances as it sees fit. |  |

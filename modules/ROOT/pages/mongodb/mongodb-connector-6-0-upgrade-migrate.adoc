Upgrade Anypoint Connector for MongoDB (MongoDB Connector) to version 6.0.0.

== Supported Upgrade Paths

[%header,cols="50a,50a"]
|===
|From Version | To Version
|5.3.x |6.0.0
|===

== Changes in This Release

This release contains the following changes:

* Changed connection types and configuration
* Changed operation names, metadata, fields, and values
* Changed input sources

=== Changes in Connection Types and Configuration

This release contains the following changes to connection configuration and types.

* Removed the Connection String connection type. There is now a single, unified generic connection that contains the configurable properties that were previously available in the Connection String connection type.
* Removed the Metadata configuration section. MongoDB 6.0 automatically generates the metadata.

==== Config Advanced Tab

The following changes apply to the Advanced tab in the global configuration:

* Added the following read concern options:
** Read concern: Enables the control of the consistency and isolation properties of the data read from replica sets and replica set shards.
** Read preference: Specifies the read preferences for this connection.
** Maximum staleness seconds: Specifies how stale a secondary can be before the client stops using it for read operations. A value of -1 means that there is no maximum staleness threshold.
** Read preference tags: Enables you to specify a tag set in the read preference to target those members associated with a tag in the set.
* Added the following write concern options, with the following fields:
** Write concern acknowledgment: Requests an  acknowledgment that the write operation was propagated to the specified number of instances.
** Write concern timeout: Specifies a time limit for the write concern.
** Write concern timeout timeunit: Specifies a time unit for the Write concern timeout field.

==== Connection Section

The following changes apply to the tabs in the Connection section of the global configuration:

* Added the following fields to the General tab:
** Required Libraries: Reference to the MongoDB Driver.The version must be 3.11 or higher.
** Server Addresses: This field is now is a list of server addresses to use for the connection.
* Added a new Security tab for TLS context configuration.
* Added the following fields to the Advanced tab:
** Authentication mechanism: Authentication mechanism used for this connection
** Replica set name: Name of the replica set to which to connect
** Authentication source: Database name associated with the user’s credentials
** Compressors: List of compressors for which to enable network compression for communication between this client and a mongod/mongos instance
** Zlib compression level: Integer that specifies the compression level if using zlib for network compression. Set this field to 0 for no compression or to 1-9 for compression, with 1 being the lowest compression level and 9 the highest. High compression levels require more processing time than lower compression levels.
** Connection timeout: Connection timeout used when establishing the socket connections
** Connection timeout time unit: Time unit for the Connection timeout field
** Local threshold: Size of the latency window for selecting among multiple, suitable MongoDB instances
** Local threshold time unit: Time unit for the Local threshold time unit field
** Server selection timeout: How long a time to block for server selection before throwing an exception
** Server selection timeout time unit: Time unit for the Server selection timeout field
** Socket timeout: Maximum time to wait for a send or receive operation on a socket before the attempt times out
** Socket timeout unit: Time unit for the  Socket timeout field
** Min connection pool size: Minimum size for the connection pool
** Max connection pool size: Maximum size for the connection pool
** Max wait queue time: Maximum wait queue time for the connection pool
** Max wait queue time unit: Time unit for the Maximum wait queue time field
** Max connection life time: Maximum connection lifetime for the connection pool
** Max connection life time time unit: Time unit for the Maximum connection life time field
** Max connection idle time: Maximum connection idle time for the connection pool
** Max connection idle time unit: Time unit for the Maximum connection idle time field

== Changed Operations Metadata

MongoDB 5.x generated operations metadata when the user provided a set of documents per collection from which to take the attributes. MongoDB 6.0 generates metadata automatically, based on the latest document in each collection.

=== Metadata in MongoDB v6.0

[%header,cols="34%,33%,33%"]
|===
|Operation Name	| Input Metadata	|Output Metadata

| Insert Document
|Document
| Resolved dynamically based on the selected value of the collection parameter. The connector adds the latest document of the given collection and uses the document's structure as input-output metadata.

| Insert Documents
|Document
|Resolved dynamically based on the selected value of the collection parameter. The connector adds the latest document of the given collection and uses the document's structures structure as input/output metadata.

| Update Documents
| N/A
| JSON that contains the following structure: { "matched" : int, "modified" : int, upsertedId: JSON }

| Remove Documents
| Query: JSON Object
| N/A

| Count Documents
| Query: JSON Object
| N/A

| Find Documents
| Query: JSON Object
| Resolved dynamically based on the selected value of the collection parameter. The connector uses the structure of the first document in the given collection.

| Create File
| N/A
a| A GridFS JSON object with the following structure:

* JSON Id

== Changes in Input Sources

MongoDB 6.0.0 has one input source, Object Listener, which retrieves all of the created documents that belong to a specific collection.

The Delete Sources and Update Sources input sources were removed.

=== Metadata in Object Listener

[%header,cols="50%,50%"]
|===
|Input Metadata	|Output Metadata

| N/A
| The connector resolves output metadata dynamically based on the selected value of the Collection Name parameter. The connector reads the last document of the given collection and uses the document's structure as output metadata.

== Requirements and Limitations

== Upgrade Prerequisites

Before you perform the upgrade, you must:

. Create a backup of your files, data, and configuration in case you need to restore to the previous version.
.Install MongoDB v6.0 to replace the MongoDB operations that were previously included in MongoDB Connector v5.x.

== Upgrade Steps

Follow these steps to perform the upgrade from MongoDB Connector v5.3.x to MongoDB Connector v6.0:

. In Anypoint Studio, create a Mule project.
. In the Mule Palette view, click Search in Exchange.
. In the *Add Dependencies to Project* window, enter `MongoDB in the search field.
. In the *Available modules* section, select *MongoDB Connector* and click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.
. Verify that the salesforce-connector dependency version is 6.0.0 in the `pom.xml` file.

Studio upgrades the connector automatically.

== Verify the Upgrade

After you install the latest version of the connector, follow these steps to verify the upgrade:

. In Studio, verify that there are no errors in the *Problems* or *Console* views.
. Check the project `pom.xml` file and verify that there are no problems.
. Test the connection and verify that the operations work.

== Troubleshooting

If there are problems with caching the parameters and metadata, try restarting Studio.

== Revert the Upgrade

If it is necessary to revert to the previous version of MongoDB Connector, change the mule-mongodb-connector dependency version 6.0.0 in the project’s `pom.xml` to the previous version.

Release Notes: xref:release-notes::connector/connector-jms.adoc[JMS Connector Release Notes]

JMS (Java Message Service) is a widely-used API for Message Oriented Middleware. It allows communication between different components of a distributed application to be loosely coupled, reliable, and asynchronous.


JMS supports two models for messaging:

* Queues - Point-to-point

* Topics - Publish and subscribe

The JMS connector lets you send and receive messages to queues and topics for any message service which implements the JMS specification.

[NOTE]
====
The JMS documentation set provides information about multiple versions of the JMS connector. 

For information about each Mule 4 JMS Connector version, see:

== Queues - Point-to-point

In the point-to-point or queuing model, a sender posts messages to a particular queue and a receiver reads messages from the queue. Here, the sender knows the destination of the message and posts the message directly to the receiver’s queue.

It is characterized by the following:

* Only one consumer gets the message

* The sender does not have to be running at the time the consumer consumes the message, nor does the consumer need to be running at the time the message is sent

* Every message successfully processed is acknowledged by the consumer

== Topics - Publish and subscribe

The publish/subscribe model supports publishing messages to a particular message topic. Subscribers may register interest in receiving messages on a particular message topic. In this model, neither the publisher nor the subscriber know about each other. A good analogy for this is an anonymous bulletin board.

JMS is characterized by the following:

* Multiple consumers (or none) receive the message

* There is a timing dependency between publishers and subscribers. The publisher has to create a message topic for clients to subscribe.

* The subscriber has to remain continuously active to receive messages, unless it has established a durable subscription. In that case, messages published while the subscriber is not connected redistribute when it reconnects.

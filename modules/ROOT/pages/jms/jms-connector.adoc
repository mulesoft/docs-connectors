The JMS connector enables your application to do messaging using the JMS implementation of your choice. Its main features include:

* Pub/Sub pattern support on any given destination.
* Listen/Reply pattern support on any given destination.
* Publish-Consume pattern support on any given destination, with fixed or temporary reply Queue.
* Fully compliant with JMS 2.0, 1.1 and 1.0.2 specifications.

== Configuring the Connector

Out of the box, the JMS connector comes with a fine tunned set of default values, both for publishing and consuming messages. This means that the only requirement is for you to configure which connection should be used.

This example sets a minimal connection to an in-memory ActiveMQ broker the JMS connector:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:config name="JMS_Config">
  <jms:active-mq-connection/>
</jms:config>
----

=== Defining Global Defaults

The JMS `config` allows you to define multiple parameters that will be used as a default while consuming or publishing messages. This way, you can define a global default behavior for all the operations associated the config and then override each parameter only in the operations that require a custom behavior.

For example, we can define a default `selector` behavior when consuming a Message in any of the operations that are associated to this config, and also a default

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:config name="JMS_Config">
  <jms:active-mq-connection/>
  <jms:consumer-config selector="JMSType = `INVOICE`"/>
  <jms:producer-config timeToLive="60000"/>
</jms:config>
----

In this case, every operation `consume` or `listener` associated to this config will use this `selector` by default, while every time we do a `publish` or `publish-consume`, the outgoing Message will have a TTL of 60 seconds.

All of this properties can be overriden at operation level when required. Let`s say we need to `publish` a Message with a shorter TTL, we can do so using this config and overriding the parameter:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:publish config-ref="JMS_Config" timeToLive="10000"/>
----


[[connection_settings]]
== Connecting to a Broker
A JMS connection is defined by a set of general parameters that apply for any connection, as well as particular configurations related to the actual broker implementation that`s going to be used.

=== Selecting the JMS Spec

TIP: The main common parameter is the JMS `specification`, used to select between all the supported specs, which are `2.0`, `1.1` and `1.0.2b`. This `specification` must be supported by the broker implementation associated to this connection, otherwise the connection will fail.

WARNING: Features available only in JMS `2.0` won`t work with any other `specification`.


=== Providing Credentials For Authentication

In order to do stablish an authenticated connection, you need to configure the `username` and `password` in the `connection` element:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:config name="JMS_Config">
  <jms:active-mq-connection username="${env.user}" password="${env.pass}"/>
</jms:config>
----


=== Configuring Connections Caching

In order to connect with a broker and execute the required operations, the JMS Connector creates multiple Sessions, Consumers and Producers that can be cached and reused in order to increase the performance of the application. Because of this capability, the JMS Connector allows you to configure which `caching-strategy` to use when creating new Connections, caching by default both Consumers and Producers and preserving as many instances as possible in memory at the same time.

Customizing the cache configuration can be done directly in the connection declaration:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:config name="JMS_Config">
  <jms:active-mq-connection>
    <jms:caching-strategy>
      <jms:default-caching sessionCacheSize="100" consumersCache="false" producersCache="true"/>
    </jms:caching-strategy>
  </jms:active-mq-connection>
</jms:config>
----

In the same way, you can completely disable the caching of Connections using the `no-caching` option:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:config name="JMS_Config">
  <jms:generic-connection connectionFactory="customConnectionFactory">
    <jms:caching-strategy>
        <jms:no-caching/>
    </jms:caching-strategy>
  </jms:generic-connection>
</jms:config>
----

TIP: Disabling the sessions cache using the `no-caching` configuration is greatly discouraged and is meant to be used in cases where a custom ConnectionFactory is used that already handles it`s own cache.

=== Identifying The Connection Client

The purpose of client identifier is to associate a connection and its objects with a state maintained on behalf of the client by a provider, and it is *mandatory* for identifying an unshared durable subscription.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:config name="JMS_Config">
  <jms:active-mq-connection clientId="${env.clientId}"/>
</jms:config>
----

WARNING: By definition, the client state identified by a `clientId` can be "in use" by only one Connection at a time.


== Connecting To ActiveMQ

Support for ActiveMQ 5 is provided out of the box by the connector using the `active-mq-connection`. With this connection, you can use both JMS 1.1 (the default) or JMS 1.0.2b specs, and configure all the general connection parameters for JMS, as well as the custom parameters only present in ActiveMQ.

Once we declare the `active-mq-connection`, all that`s left to do is set up the connection factory with our custom configuration. Every parameter in the connection comes with a default value, meaning that you are required to configure only the parameters relevant for your use case. Also, the ActiveMQ connection exposes parameters that are exclusive of ActiveMQ implementation, like `initialRedeliveryDelay`.

An example of a simple configuration of an ActiveMQ connection would be:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
 <jms:config name="JMS_Config">
  <jms:active-mq-connection >
   <jms:factory-configuration brokerUrl="tcp://localhost:61616" />
  </jms:active-mq-connection>
 </jms:config>
----

== Using Different Brokers

In cases where ActiveMQ 5 is not the chosen broker, we can use the `generic-connection` to declare a connection to any broker implementation. Out of the box, the connector provides a JNDI based connection factory builder that allows to configure the connection using JNDI in the context of the application.

For example, if we want to connect with Artemis to use the JMS 2.0 spec, we could define our connection factory in this way:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:config name="JMS_Config">
    <jms:generic-connection specification="JMS_2_0">
        <jms:connection-factory>
            <jms:jndi-connection-factory connectionFactoryJndiName="ConnectionFactory" lookupDestination="ALWAYS">
                <jms:name-resolver-builder
                        jndiInitialContextFactory="org.apache.activemq.artemis.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory"
                        jndiProviderUrl="tcp://localhost:61616?broker.persistent=false&amp;broker.useJmx=false">
                    <jms:provider-properties>
                        <jms:provider-property key="queue.jndi-queue-in" value="in.queue"/>
                        <jms:provider-property key="topic.jndi-topic-in" value="in.topic"/>
                    </jms:provider-properties>
                </jms:name-resolver-builder>
            </jms:jndi-connection-factory>
        </jms:connection-factory>
    </jms:generic-connection>
</jms:config>
----

If you have configured a JNDI context on the connector, you can also look up destinations via JNDI using the `lookupDestination` attribute, which provides three different configurations:

* NEVER: No lookup is done and the destinations are created using the existing JMS session
* TRY_ALWAYS: First try to find the destination using JNDI, and in case it doesn`t exist, create it using the current JMS Session.
* ALWAYS: If a queue/topic cannot be found via JNDI, fail with a `JMS:DESTINATION_NOT_FOUND` error

For more information regarding the `generic-connection` or `jndi-connection-factory`, see the connector reference docs.

== Setting Up The Connetion Required Libraries

NOTE: No matter what tipe of connection you are using, you`ll always need to configure a library containing the *JMS client implementation*, since the connector is not bound to any particular implementation.

=== ActiveMQ External Libraries

For an ActiveMQ connection, there are three possible libraries that need to be configured depending on your connection settings:

* ActiveMQ JMS Client Library:

The `activemq-client` of your chice that provides a valid `org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnectionFactory` implementation.

WARNING: This dependency is always required

For example, you can use:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
     <groupId>org.apache.activemq</groupId>
     <artifactId>activemq-client</artifactId>
     <version>5.14.5</version>
 </dependency>
----

* ActiveMQ Broker Library:

The `activemq-broker` is *only required when using an in-memory broker* based on the VM transport (which is the one configured by default). This dependency should provide a valid `org.apache.activemq.broker.Broker` implementation.

For example, you can use:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.activemq</groupId>
    <artifactId>activemq-broker</artifactId>
    <version>5.14.5</version>
</dependency>
----

* ActiveMQ KahaDB Library:

The `activemq-kahadb-store` is *only required when using an _persistent_ in-memory broker* based on the VM transport (ie, `vm://localhost?broker.persistent=true`).  This dependency should provide a valid `org.apache.activemq.store.kahadb.KahaDBPersistenceAdapter` implementation.

For example, you can use:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.activemq</groupId>
    <artifactId>activemq-kahadb-store</artifactId>
    <version>5.14.5</version>
</dependency>
----

=== Generic External Libraries

When using a `jms:generic-connection`, you`ll also need to provide all the libraries that your ConnectionFactory and configuration of choice required. This will always depend on what are the implementations you choose, so be careful of adding all the dependencies to the application.

A common use case for this would be using the JMS 2.0 spec, thus you need a generic connection with a different client library, like Apache Artemis:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.activemq</groupId>
    <artifactId>activemq-kahadb-store</artifactId>
    <version>5.14.5</version>
</dependency>
----

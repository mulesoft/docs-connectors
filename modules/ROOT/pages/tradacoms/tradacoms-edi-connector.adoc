TRADACOMS EDI Connector v2.0

The TRADACOMS EDI connector lets you convert TRADACOMS transmissions to and from
DataWeave-compatible representations using lists and maps.

Supported TRADACOMS files and versions are: ACKMNT:4, AVLDET:4, CORDER:6, CRAINF:3, CREDIT:9, CUSINF:8, DELIVR:9, DLCDET:5, DRAINF:3, EXCINF:3, GENRAL:3, INVOIC:9, LPRDET:2, ORDERS:9, PAYINF:3, PICKER:4, PPRDET:2, PRIINF:8, PROINF:8, SADDET:3, SNPSTS:3, SRMINF:9, UCNDET:3, UPLIFT:4, UTLBIL:3.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with TRADACOMS, Mule, Anypoint
Connectors, Anypoint Studio, Mule flows, and Mule Global Elements.

See the Release Notes for compatibility information. A link to the
release notes is listed in the See Also section of this document.

To use the TRADACOMS EDI connector in a production environment, you must
have purchased a MuleSoft license for Anypoint B2B.

== What's New in this Connector

TRADACOMS EDI connector 2.x makes several changes to the configuration and handling implemented by TRADACOMS EDI connector 1.x.

* TRADACOMS EDI connector 1.x only supports messages from a single version of the standard. Mule 4 TRADACOMS EDI connector 2.x supports messages from multiple versions of the standards. The version information in the message header (UNH segment) data is used to identify the standard version, and the message identifier determines the particular schema.

* Identification parameters are no longer used for the read and write operations. You can configure all parameter values in the actual message data passed to the write operation.

* TRADACOMS EDI connector 2.x adds support for a "default" schema configuration. If no schemas are referenced in the configuration, the standard version of the schema for each message is looked up from the classpath and used for reading and writing. When this occurs, no metadata is available for the message data structure, because the actual messages are unknown at design time.

== To Install this Connector in Anypoint Studio 7

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio task bar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange.
. Search for the connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

When Studio has an update, a message displays in the lower right corner, which you can click to install the update.

You must change the default Anypoint configuration to use the TRADACOMS EDI connector 2.0.0.

== To Create Schemas

If your implementation conventions differ from the standard, you can create schemas to describe your messages according to your implementation. Standard versions of the schemas for all defined TRADACOM files are included in the distribution.

=== About the EDI Schema Language

The TRADACOMS EDI Module uses a YAML format called ESL (for EDI Schema Language) to represent EDI schemas. ESLs define the structure of EDI messages in terms of structures (messages, in TRADACOMS terminology), groups, segments, composites, and elements.

The particular usage of ESL definitions for TRADACOMS has some differences from other EDI formats, particularly when working with the TRADACOMS concepts of "files" and "messages". Each file format defined by TRADACOMS gives the representation of data for some specific use. The file format is broken down into several message components, where one particular message component is allowed to repeat. Each message component is in turn broken down into segments and groups of segments, some of which may also be repeated.

In ESL terms, each TRADACOMS file format is represented by a particular schema definition. The supplied ESL schemas use the generic name for the file, which is the same as that of the repeating detail message. So for example, the Prince Information File structure is given by the PRIINF.esl schema definition. Within the file schema, each component message type is defined as a structure. The order of component messages within a file is given by the `class` value, which must be a string consisting of a single digit. The value `'1'` identifies the header message, the value `'2'` identifies the repeating detail message, and all higher values are successive messages within the file.

You can customize the TRADACOMS schema definitions to suit your data by defining an overlay schema. An overlay schema is a special form of ESL that allows you to modify a base schema, such as an TRADACOMS INVOIC schema, with your specific conventions. You don't need an overlay schema if you're using the structure defined by the standard.

You can also define your own schemas from scratch, or copy and edit a base TRADACOMS schema definition to suit your data. See the xref:1.0@partner-manager::edi-schema-language-reference.adoc[EDI Schema Language Reference] for more details.

[NOTE]
====
YAML uses a combination of lists and sets of key-value pairs. The order of
values is not important, as long as the required items are present. Quotes
(either single or double quotes) are used around values that may consist
of digits but are meant to be interpreted as strings (since otherwise the
YAML parser treats the values as numbers). Indentation is used to show the nesting of lists.

For readability, the ESL structures shown here define all simple key-value
pairs before any lists that are part of the same definition.
====

=== To Define your Implementation Convention with an Overlay Schema

To specify a schema according to your implementation convention, you can follow this process:

. Create an overlay schema that imports the base schema you want to customize - for example, TRADACOMS INVOIC.
. Customize the overall structure for segment usage, positions, groups, and counts.
. Customize segments, including usage and counts.

Overlay schemas are very similar in structure to a xref:1.0@partner-manager::edi-schema-language-reference.adoc[complete schema definition], but instead of providing all the details of the schema structure they only list changes. Overlay schemas specify how to use implementation conventions with a particular trading partner to extend and customize the standard.

By way of example, here's a sample overlay schema modifying the basic TRADACOMS INVOIC file definition. This example adds a REBILL message at version 6 to the file, following all existing messages in the file (class value `'5'`, since there are four message components normally present in an INVOIC file).

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
form: TRADACOMS
version: 'INVOIC9'
imports: [ '/tradacoms/INVOIC.esl' ]
structures:
- id: 'REBILL'
  name: 'REBILL:6'
  class: '5'
  data:
  - { idRef: 'MHD', usage: M }
  - { idRef: 'RBL', usage: M }
  - { idRef: 'MTR', usage: M }
segments:
- id: 'RBL'
  name: 'REBILLING DETAILS'
  values:
  - { id: 'RBLA', name: 'Rebill From Field', usage: M, type: char, minLength: 1, maxLength: 14 }
  - { id: 'RBLB', name: 'Rebill To Field', usage: M, type: char, minLength: 1, maxLength: 14 }
  - { idRef: 'PAI', position: '0040', usage: U }
----

=== Structure Overlay

A structure overlay details modifications to the base schema definition of an TRADACOMS message. Most often these modifications take the form of marking segments or groups in the base definition as unused, but any usage or repetition count change is allowed.

The following is an example of a structure overlay:

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
structures:
- idRef: 'INVFIL'
  data:
  - { idRef: 'FDT', position: '07', usage: M }
  - { idRef: 'ACD', position: '08', usage: M }
----

The modifications in this example specify that the FDT (at position 7) and ACD (at position 8) segments are required in each INVFIL message (usage: M for mandatory). With this overlay, errors are reported if either the FDT or ACD segment is not present in a message.

The key-value pairs at the structure level are:

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|Key |Description
|idRef |The ID for the message being modified.
|class |The position of the message within a file (optional).
|name |The message name and version (optional).
|data |List of segment and group modifications within the structure (optional, each is only used when there are modifications to that section).
|===

Each item in the list of structure data components is either a segment reference or a group definition. Both are shown here using a compact YAML syntax where the values for each reference are given as comma-separated key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces. The values are:

The values are:

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|Key |Description
|idRef |The referenced segment ID. This is optional and verified if provided, but otherwise ignored. The position value is used to uniquely identify segments within the section.
|position |The segment position within the message section.
|usage |Usage code, which may be M for Mandatory, C for Conditional, or U for Unused.
|count |Maximum repetition count value, which may be a number or the special value `'>1'` meaning any number of repeats. The count value is optional and a base definition value is used if a value is not specified.
|===

The values in a group definition are:

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|Key |Description
|groupIdRef |The referenced group ID. This key is optional and verified if provided, but otherwise ignored. The position value is used to uniquely identify a group within a section.
|position |The segment position within the message section.
|usage |Usage code, which may be M for Mandatory, C for Conditional, or U for Unused.
|count |Maximum repetition count value, which may be a number or the special value `>1` meaning any number of repeats. The count value is optional and a base definition value is used if a value is not specified.
|items |List of segments (and potentially nested group) making up the group.
|===

=== Segment Overlays

A segment overlay again details modifications to the base schema definition. Most often these modifications take the form of marking elements or composites in the base definition as unused, but any usage or repetition count change is allowed. Here are some sample segment overlays:

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
structures:
- idRef: 'INVFIL'
  data:
  - { idRef: 'FDT', position: '07' }
segments:
- idRef: 'FDT'
  values:
  - { position: 1, usage: M }
  - { position: 2, usage: M }
----

This example modifies the base definition for the FDT segment, making both values defined in the segment required fields (they are optional in the base definition).

Segment modifications only effect structures included in the overlay with explicit references to the modified segments. That's why the FDT segment reference needs to be included in the INVFIL message structure part of the schema, even though nothing (such as usage or repetition count) is being changed for how this segment is used within the message.

The key-value pairs in a segment overlay are:

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|Key |Description
|idRef |Segment identifier.
|trim |Trim position in segment, meaning all values from this point on are marked as unused (optional).
|values |List of individual value modifications.
|===

The values list references values in the segment by position. The values for these references are:

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|Key |Description
|position |The value position within the segment.
|name |The name of the value in the segment (optional, base definition value used if not specified).
|usage |Usage code, which may be M for Mandatory, C for Conditional, or U for Unused.
|===

=== To Determine the TRADACOMS Schema Location

To use the connector, you need to know the locations of the schemas
in your project. If you're using out-of-the-box TRADACOMS schemas and
not customizing anything, the schema location follows the
`/tradacoms/{file}.esl` pattern, so for the ORDERS file your schema location is "/tradacoms/ORDERS.esl".

If you're using one or more custom schemas, you should put these under
a directory in `src/main/app` and refer to the location using `${app.home}`.
For example, if you've put your CREDIT schema (either overlay or full) under `src/main/app/mypartner/CREDIT.esl,
your schema location is `${app.home}/mypartner/CREDIT.esl`.

The Mule Runtime automatically checks `src/main/app` for any locations
that contain the `${app.home}` value.

== To Create a Mule Project in Anypoint Studio 7

After you install the connector and customize your schemas (if needed), you can start using the connector. Create separate configurations for each implementation convention.

. Click the Global Elements tab at the base of the canvas, and click Create.
. In the Choose Global Type wizard, locate and select the TRADACOMS EDI: Configuration, and click OK.
. Click OK to save the global connector configurations.
. Return to the Message Flow tab in Studio.

Set each tab in the Global Element Properties as described in the sections that follow.

=== About the General Tab

image::tradacoms/tradacoms-edi-general.jpg[General tab properties]

The general tab lets you configure settings for reading and writing TRADACOMS messages, including identification information used in the STX segment:

* Manually create or edit the list of schema definitions for the message structures to be used.
* Partner Sender/Recipient Code (STX FROM or UNTO Code).
* Partner Sender/Recipient Name (STX FROM or UNTO Name).
* Mule Application Sender/Recipient Code (STX FROM or UNTO Code).
* Mule Application Sender/Recipient Name (STX FROM or UNTO Name).

All these identification values are optional. If any are configured, the values are verified when reading an input transmission and used as the defaults when writing an output transmission if no value is specified in the output data.

=== About the Parser Tab

image::tradacoms/tradacoms-edi-parser.jpg[Parser tab properties]

You can set the following options to control parser validation of receive messages if needed:

* Enforce minimum and maximum lengths for receive values.
* Allow unknown segments in a message.
* Allow segments marked as 'Unused' in a message.
* Enforce segment order in a message.

=== About the Writer Tab

image::tradacoms/tradacoms-edi-writer.jpg[Writer tab properties]

Settings for writing messages:

* Default Sender's Transmission Reference used when writing a transmission.
* Default Sender's Transmission Reference used when writing a transmission.
* Default Application Reference used when writing a transmission.
* Default Application Reference used when writing a transmission.

=== About Configuration Options in XML

All values listed in the Anypoint Studio configuration can be set directly in XML.

General parameters control both send and receive document handling (all are optional):

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|XML Value |Visual Studio Option
|schemas=list of values |List of paths for schemas to be used by connector. The paths may be either for a file system or classpath.
|partnerCode |Code used to identify partner. When this value is specified it is used both to validate the Transmission Sender Code in received transmissions and to set the Transmission Recipient Code in sent transmissions (if not already specified in map data). If not specified the Transmission Sender Code is not checked in received transmissions.
|partnerName=Name used to identify partner. When this value is specified it is used both to validate the Transmission Sender Name in received transmissions and to set the Transmission Recipient Name in sent transmissions (if not already specified in map data). If not specified the Transmission Sender Name is not checked in received transmissions.
|selfCode |Code used to identify Mule application. When this value is specified it is used both to validate the Transmission Recipient Code in received transmissions and to set the Transmission Sender Code in sent transmissions (if not already specified in map data). If not specified the Transmission Recipient Code is not checked in received transmissions.
|selfName |Name used to identify self. When this value is specified it is used both to validate the Transmission Recipient Name in received transmissions and to set the Transmission Sender Name in sent transmissions (if not already specified in map data). If not specified the Transmission Recipient Name is not checked in received transmissions.
|===

Parser parameters control the parser operation and the types of error conditions which cause receive messages to be rejected (all are optional, with default values as shown):

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|XML Value |Visual Studio Option
|enforceLengthLimits="true" |Enforce minimum and maximum lengths for receive values.
|allowUnknownSegments="false" |Allow unknown segments in a message.
|allowUnusedSegments="false" |Allow segments marked as 'Unused' in a message.
|enforceSegmentOrder="true" |Enforce segment order in a message.
|===

Writer parameters control the writer operation (all are optional):

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|XML Value |Visual Studio Option
|sendSenderReference |Default Sender's Transmission Reference used when writing a transmission.
|sendRecipientReference |Default Sender's Transmission Reference used when writing a transmission.
|sendApplicationReference |Default Application Reference used when writing a transmission.
|sendPriorityCode |Default Transmission Priority Code used when writing a transmission.
|===

== To Set Your Schema Locations

You can configure schema locations in the Anypoint Studio XML view.

In Anypoint Studio, switch to the XML view by clicking Configuration XML and modify your TRADACOMS EDI configuration to include a list of all the schemas you wish to include by adding an `+<http://edischema[edi:schema]>+` element for each document type:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<tradacoms-edi:config name="TRADACOMS_EDI__Configuration" identKeys="true" doc:name="TRADACOMS EDI: Configuration">
  <tradacoms-edi:schemas>
    <tradacoms:schema value="/tradacoms/ORDERS.esl"/>
  </tradacoms-edi:schemas>
</tradacoms-edi:config>
----

After you create a global element for your TRADACOMS EDI, configure any schemas and operations.

== About the TRADACOMS Message Structure

The connector enables reading or writing of TRADACOMS documents into or from the canonical EDI message structure. This structure is represented as a hierarchy of Java Maps and Lists, which can be manipulated using DataWeave or code. Each transaction has its own structure, as defined in the schemas, as outlined above.

The message itself contains the following keys (some of which only apply to either the read operation or the write operation, as indicated):

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Key Name |Description
|{File} |Wrapper for message data, with keys matching the names of the component messages linking to data for those messages. For the repeating detail message of the file (always class '2') the value is a list of maps; for the singleton messages of the file the values are maps.
|Errors (read only) |A list of errors which are associated with the input message. (See the TradacomsError structure description in the Reading and Validating TRADACOMS Messages section below.)
|Id |File (the name of the TRADACOMS file read).
|STX |Map of STX segment data from start of file.
|===

Individual messages have their own maps under the file name map, with keys matching the segments of the message. For instance, an INVOIC file would
have the key `'INVOIC'` in the root map, and under that keys for `'INVFIL'`, `'INVOIC'` (the list of data for repeating INVOIC messages),
`'VATTLR'` and `'INVTLR'`. Within the INVTLR map there would be keys `'01_MHD'`, `'02_TOT'`, and `'03_MTR'` for the segments of the
INVTLR message.

== To Read and Validate TRADACOMS EDI Messages

. To read a TRADACOMS message, search the palette for TRADACOMS EDI, and drag the TRADACOMS Read operation into a flow.
. Go to the properties view, select the connector configuration you created above and select the Read operation. This operation reads any byte stream into the structure described by your TRADACOMS schemas.

The TRADACOMS module validates the message when it reads it in. Message validation includes checking the syntax and content of envelope segments STX and END as well as the actual messages in the file. Normally errors are both logged and accumulated and reported in TradacomsError instances, and all accepted messages (whether error free or with non-fatal errors) are passed on for processing as part of the output message Map. If any fatal errors are found no file data is returned, only the error list.

Error data entered in the receive data map uses the EdifactError class, a read-only JavaBean with the following properties:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Property |Description
|segment |The zero-based index within the input of the segment causing the error.
|fatal |Flag for a fatal error, in which case no file data is returned.
|errorText |Text description of the error.
|===

Error data is returned by the read operation as optional lists with the "Errors" key at both root level of the data structure and at the message level. At the message level, this list contains non-fatal errors encountered during the parsing of that message. At the root level, this list contains both interchange errors and fatal message errors.

== To Write TRADACOMS EDI Messages

To write an outgoing message, search the palette for TRADACOMS EDI and drag the TRADACOMS Write operation into a flow. Construct an outgoing TRADACOMS EDI message according to the structure as defined above for input to the write operation. If no fatal errors are found in the write operation the normal flow continues. Otherwise, an exception is thrown which describes the error.

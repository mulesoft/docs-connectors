There are different acknowledgement configurations provided by the AMQP Connector.

== Automatic Acknowledgement On Success

The `AUTO` `ackMode` can be used in the `amqp:listener` component, causing the automatic ACK of the received Message *if and only if the flow execution completes successfully*.
In case that an error occurs during the flow execution that causes it to terminate prematurely, then the Message will not be ACKed and redelivery will occur.

== Immediate Acknowledgement

Setting the `ackMode` to `IMMEDIATE` either in `amqp:listener` or `amqp:consume` operations will cause the Message to be automatically ACKed once it is consumed, and prior to any processing of the Message by the application.
Having the Message automatically acknowledged once it is received means that the Message won`t be redelivered if any error occurs during the processing of the Message, so application logic like a dead letter queue has to be created to handle errors without losing Messages.

== Manual Acknowledgement

As you may expect, the `MANUAL` `ackMode` delegates all the responsibility of performing the ACK on the Message to the application logic.

With this configuration, every Message received by either the `listener` or `consume` operations will have an `ackId` available in the MuleMessage `attributes` which identifies this Message uniquely for a given channel.

The `ackId` that identifies the Message will then be passed on to the `amqp:ack` operation:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="consumerWithManualAck">
    <amqp:consume config-ref="config" queueName="${queueName}" ackMode="MANUAL" />

    <!--Do message processing-->
    <logger message="#[payload]">

    <amqp:ack ackId="#[attributes.ackId]" />
</flow>

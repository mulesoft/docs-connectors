Anypoint Connector for AMQP (AMQP Connector) v1.4

Release Notes: xref:release-notes::connector/connector-amqp.adoc[AMQP Connector Release Notes] +
Exchange: https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange/com.mulesoft.connectors/mule-amqp-connector/[AMQP Connector]

AMQP Connector enables your application to do messaging using an AMQP 0.9.1 compliant broker. The connector's main features include:

* RPC Pattern through request-reply consumption using private temporal queues
* SDK Transaction management with optional channel self-recovery
* Synchronous Message requesting, with timeout
* Management operations for exchange and queue declarations
* All AMQP message properties, including custom headers
* Reply to (publishing replies to the default exchange)
* Automatic, Mule-driven and manual message acknowledgement
* Manual message rejection
* Mandatory and immediate publishing parameters and handling of returned (undelivered) messages through error handling
* Prefetch size and count "quality of service" settings
* noLocal and exclusive consumers
* TLS/SSL connectivity
* Message Builder functionality similar to the one provided by the JMS Connector

== Configure the Connector

Out of the box, the AMQP connector comes with a fine tuned set of default values, both for publishing and consuming messages. This means that the only requirement is for you to configure which connection should be used.

This example sets a minimal connection to a broker in localhost:

[source,example,linenums]
----
<amqp:config name="AMQP_Config">
  <amqp:connection 
    host="localhost" 
    username="guest" 
    password="guest" />
</amqp:config>
----

The Apache Maven pom.xml file dependency for the AMQP Connector is as follows:

[source,example,linenums]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.mulesoft.connectors</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-amqp-connector</artifactId>
  <version>RELEASE</version>
  <classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
</dependency>
----

Mule converts `RELEASE` to the current version.

=== Define Global Defaults

The AMQP `config` allows you to define multiple parameters that will be used by default while consuming or publishing messages. This way, you can define a global default behavior for all the operations associated to the config and then override each parameter only in the operations that require a custom behavior.

For example, we can define a prefetch size window in terms of size and in terms of whole messages.

[source,example,linenums]
----
<amqp:config name="AMQP_Config">
   <amqp:connection host="localhost" username="guest" password="guest" />
   <amqp:quality-of-service-config prefetchSize="4" prefetchCount="4" />
   <amqp:consumer-config ackMode="IMMEDIATE" />
   <amqp:publisher-config requestBrokerConfirms="true"/>
</amqp:config>
----

In this case, every `consume` operation or `listener` associated to this config uses an acknowledge mode of type `IMMEDIATE`, while every time we do a `publish` or `publish-consume`, the outgoing Message requests a confirm from the broker.

All of this properties can be overridden at the operation level when required. Let's say we need to `publish` a message that does not require confirms from the broker:

[source,example]
----
<amqp:publish config-ref="AMQP_Config" requestBrokerConfirms="false"/>
----

== Connect to a Broker

An AMQP connection is defined by a set of general parameters that apply for any connection.

=== Provide Credentials For Authentication

to establish an authenticated connection, you have to set the `username`, `password`, and the `virtualhost` in the `connection` element:

[source,example,linenums]
----
<amqp:config name="AMQP_Config">
  <amqp:connection host="localhost" virtualhost="/" username="guest" password="guest" />
</amqp:config>
----

=== Set TLS/SSL Connectivity to the Broker

Using the parameter `useTls` you can create a secure connection to the broker using the default TLS Context. You can also provide a custom TLS Context as a child element in the connection or as global element in the following way:

[source,example,linenums]
----
<tls:context name="globalTlsContext">
  <tls:trust-store path="tls/tlstest-cacerts.jks"
    password="changeit" />
  <tls:key-store path="tls/tlstest-keystore.jks"
    keyPassword="changeit" password="changeit" />
</tls:context>

<amqp:config name="config">
  <amqp:connection host="localhost" port="5671"
    virtualHost="/" username="guest" password="guest" useTls="true"
    tlsContext="globalTlsContext" />
 </amqp:config>
----

=== Server Name Indication

As of AMQP connector version 1.1.0 Server Name Indication (SNI) is supported. 

Use the parameter `useSNI` to indicate that the AMQP client should add the hostname as an extension in the ClientHello message during the SSL handshake. If the broker supports SNI, it's available to verify the hostname and present different certificates for the same IP address.

[source,example,linenums]
----
<tls:context name="globalTlsContext">
  <tls:trust-store path="tls/tlstest-cacerts.jks"
    password="changeit" />
  <tls:key-store path="tls/tlstest-keystore.jks"
    keyPassword="changeit" password="changeit" />
</tls:context>

<amqp:config name="config">
  <amqp:connection host="localhost" port="5671"
    virtualHost="/" username="guest" password="guest" useTls="true" useSni="true"
    tlsContext="globalTlsContext" />
 </amqp:config>

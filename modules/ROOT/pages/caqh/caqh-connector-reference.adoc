= CAQH Connector Reference

+++
This is an entry point from which configurations, connection providers, operations and sources are going to be declared.
+++


== Configurations
---
[[config]]
=== Config

+++
Default configuration
+++

==== Parameters
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x
| Connection a| <<config_connection, Connection>>
 | The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | | x
| Address a| String |  |  | x
| Version a| String |  |  |
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  +++Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform expires the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime purges the instances when it sees fit.+++ |  |
|===

==== Connection Types
[[config_connection]]
===== Connection

+++
This class (as it's name implies) provides connection instances and the funcionality to disconnect and validate those connections.  All connection related parameters (values required to create a connection) must be declared in the connection providers.  This particular example is a PoolingConnectionProvider which declares that connections resolved by this provider will be pooled and reused. There are other implementations like CachedConnectionProvider which lazily creates and caches connections or simply ConnectionProvider if you want a new connection each time something requires one.
+++

====== Parameters
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Username a| String |  |  | x
| Password a| String |  |  | x
| Proxy Configuration a| <<Default>> |  |  |
| Use Persistent Connections a| Boolean |  +++If false, each connection will be closed after the first request is completed.+++ |  +++true+++ |
| Max Connections a| Number |  +++The maximum number of outbound connections that will be kept open at the same time. By default the number of connections is unlimited.+++ |  +++-1+++ |
| Connection Idle Timeout a| Number |  +++The number of milliseconds that a connection can remain idle before it is closed. The value of this attribute is only used when persistent connections are enabled.+++ |  +++60000+++ |
| Stream Response a| Boolean |  +++Whether or not received responses should be streamed, meaning processing will continue as soon as all headers are parsed and the body streamed as it arrives. When enabled, the response MUST be eventually read since depending on the configured buffer size it may not fit into memory and processing will stop until space is available.+++ |  +++false+++ |
| Response Buffer Size a| Number |  +++The space in bytes for the buffer where the HTTP response will be stored.+++ |  +++-1+++ |
| Connection Timeout a| Number |  |  +++60000+++ |
| TLS Configuration a| <<Tls>> |  +++Protocol to use for communication. Valid values are HTTP and HTTPS. Default value is HTTP. When using HTTPS the HTTP communication is going to be secured using TLS / SSL. If HTTPS was configured as protocol then the user needs to configure at least the keystore in the tls:context child element of this listener-config.+++ |  |
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  +++When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to true, deployment fails if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy+++ |  |

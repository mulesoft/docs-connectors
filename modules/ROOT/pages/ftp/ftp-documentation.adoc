== Operations

[[copy]]
=== Copy
`<ftp:copy>`

+++
Copies the file at the sourcePath into the targetPath. If targetPath doesn't exist, and neither does its parent, then an attempt is made to create depending on the value of the createParentFolder argument. If such argument is present, then a FTP:ILLEGAL_PATH is thrown. If the target file already exists, then it is overwritten if the overwrite argument is true. Otherwise, FTP:FILE_ALREADY_EXISTS error is thrown. As for the sourcePath, it can either be a file or a directory. If it points to a directory, then it is copied recursively.

`<ftp:move>`

+++
Moves the file at the sourcePath into the targetPath. An attempt is made to create depending on the value of the createParentFolder argument. If such argument is, then a FTP:ILLEGAL_PATH is thrown. If the target file already exists, it's overwritten if the overwrite argument is true. Otherwise, FTP:FILE_ALREADY_EXISTS error is thrown. As for the sourcePath, it can either be a file or a directory. If it points to a directory, then it's moved recursively.

* FTP:CONNECTIVITY {nbsp}
* FTP:ILLEGAL_PATH {nbsp}


[[read]]
=== Read
`<ftp:read>`

+++
Obtains the content and metadata of a file at a given path. The operation itself returns a Message which its payload is a InputStream with the file's content, and the metadata is represented as an FtpFileAttributes object that's placed as the message Message#getAttributes() attributes. If the lock parameter is set to true, then a file system level lock is placed on the file until the input stream this operation returns is closed or fully consumed. Because the lock is actually provided by the host file system, its behavior might change depending on the mounted drive and the operation system on which mule is running. Take that into consideration before blindly relying on this lock. This method also makes a best effort to determine the MIME type of the file being read. The file's extension is used to make an educated guess on the file's MIME type. The user also has the chance to force the output encoding and mimeType through the outputEncoding and outputMimeType optional parameters.
+++

[[rename]]
=== Rename
`<ftp:rename>`

+++
Renames the file pointed by the path to the name provided on the to parameter. The to argument should not contain a path separator. FTP:ILLEGAL_PATH is thrown if this precondition is not honored.
+++

[[write]]
=== Write
`<ftp:write>`

+++
Writes the content into the file pointed by path. If the directory on which the file is attempting to be written doesn't exist, then the operation either throws the FTP:ILLEGAL_PATH error or creates the folder depending on the value of the createParentDirectory. If the file itself already exists, then the behavior depends on the supplied mode. This operation also supports locking depending on the value of the lock argument, but following the same rules and considerations as described in the read operation.

[[listener]]
=== On New File
`<ftp:listener>`

+++
Polls a directory looking for files that have been created on it. A message is generated for each file found. The key part of this functionality is how to determine that a file is actually new. 

There are three strategies for that: 

* Set the autoDelete parameter to true: This deletes each processed file after it has been processed, causing all files obtained in the next poll to be necessarily new.
* Set the moveToDirectory parameter: This moves each processed file to a different directory after it has been processed, achieving the same effect as autoDelete but without losing the file.
* Use the watermarkEnabled parameter to only pick files that have been created or updated after the last poll was executed.

A matcher can also be used for additional filtering of files.

|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Active a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can be borrowed from a session at one time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of components that may be active at one time. When maxActive is exceeded, the pool is said to be exhausted. |  |
| Max Idle a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can sit idle in the pool at any time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of Mule components that may be idle at one time. |  |

| Min Eviction Millis a| Number | Determines the minimum amount of time an object may sit idle in the pool before it is eligible for eviction. When non-positive, no objects are evicted from the pool due to idle time alone. |  |
| Eviction Check Interval Millis a| Number | Specifies the number of milliseconds between runs of the object evictor. When non-positive, no object evictor is executed. |  |
| Exhausted Action a| Enumeration, one of:

Possible values are: 

* WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL, which throws a NoSuchElementException
* WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT, which blocks by invoking Object.wait(long) until a new or idle object is available.
* WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW, which creates a new Mule instance and returns it, essentially making maxActive meaningless. If a positive maxWait value is supplied, it blocks for at most that many milliseconds, after which a NoSuchElementException isthrown.

Support Category: Premium

The Anypoint Connector for FTPS allows you to send and receive files over FTPS, enabling seamless 
integration between Mule applications and an FTPS server, using Mule runtime.

This guide helps you understand how to set up and configure a basic Mule flow with the FTPS connector.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with FTPS, 
Mule, Anypoint connectors, Anypoint Studio, elements in a Mule flow, 
and global elements.

=== Hardware and Software Requirements

See link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/hardware-and-software-requirements[Hardware and Software Requirements].

=== Compatibility

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Application/Service |Version
|Mule Runtime | 3.7.0 and later
|===

== Install the FTPS Connector

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio task bar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange and supply your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. Search for the FTPS connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

[[configuring]]
== Configure the FTPS Connector Global Element

You can configure a global element for the FTPS connector for use by 
multiple instances of the FTPS connector in your application. However, not all connector instances use the same global element or configuration, and it is not uncommon to have multiple connectors in a flow, using different global elements or configurations to connect to one or different instances.

You can provide connection and other details in the Global Element Properties window. These settings 
are saved in a global element and referenced by applicable connector instances:

[TIP]
====
In the previous image, the placeholder values refer to values saved in a `.properties` file, which exists by default in the `src/main/resources` folder of your project (See link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/configuring-properties[Configuring Properties]).

For easy maintenance and re-usability of your connector properties, we recommend that you use a `.properties` file. Avoid hardcoding these values in the global element if you need to deploy the app to different environments, such as production, development, and QA, where your access credentials might differ. For more, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/deploying-to-multiple-environments[Deploying to Multiple Environments].

=== Global Element Properties for FTPS Connector

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|Username | The username of the user's login on the FTPS server - if the server 
allows anonymous login, you can use 'anonymous' as the username.
|Password | The password to be used for login. For anonymous login, this field can be empty.
|Host | The host address of the FTPS server.
|Port | The port where the FTPS service is running.
|Keystore path | Path to the keystore to be used for SSL.
|Keystore password | The password for the keystore file.
|Read timeout | Specifies the amount of time in milliseconds that the consumer waits for a 
response before it times out. The default value is 0, which means infinite.
|Connection timeout | Specifies the amount of time in milliseconds that the consumer attempts 
to establish a connection before it times out. The default value is 0, which means infinite.
|Disable Certificate Validation | Disable SSL certificate validation, to ignore the certificates to be used, 
and use `Trust all` policy - This is not recommended.
|Encryption mode | Specifies how to invoke client security - IMPLICIT or EXPLICIT.
|Transfer mode | Specifies how the data connection is established - PASSIVE or ACTIVE.
|===

== Using the FTPS Connector

A FTPS connector is based on the concept of the endpoint. The global element can be configured either as an:

* Inbound endpoint to read files from a FTPS server.
* Outbound connector to upload a file to a FTPS server.

=== Connector Namespace and Schema

When designing your application in Studio, when you draf the connector from the palette on to the Anypoint Studio canvas, Studio automatically populates the Mule application's XML code with the connector namespace and schema location.

Namespace:

[source, xml]
----
xmlns:ftps="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ftps"
----

Schema Location:

[source, xml]
----
http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ftps http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ftps/current/mule-ftps.xsd
----

If you are manually coding the Mule application in Studio's XML editor or other text editor, define the namespace and schema location in the header of your Configuration XML, inside the `<mule>` tag.

[source, xml,linenums]
----
<mule xmlns="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xmlns:ftps="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ftps"
      xsi:schemaLocation="
               http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core
               http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core/current/mule.xsd
               http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ftps 
	       http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ftps/current/mule-ftps.xsd">

      <!-- put your global configuration elements and flows here -->

</mule>
----

=== Using the Connector in a Mavenized Mule App

If you are coding a Mavenized Mule application, include this XML snippet in your `pom.xml` file.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.mulesoft.connectors</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-ftps-transport</artifactId>
  <version>3.1.0</version>
</dependency>
----

Inside the `<version>` tags, put the current version number. The current version is: *3.1.0*.

== FTPS Connector Example Use Cases

The example use case walkthroughs are geared toward Anypoint Studio users. For those writing and 
configuring the application in XML, jump straight to the example Mule application XML code to
link:#read-xml[Read files] or link:#write-xml[Write file] to see how the FTPS global element and 
the connector are configured in the XML in each use case.

=== Read Files from an FTPS Server and Log File Content - Studio

. In Studio, create a new Mule Project by clicking File > New > Mule Project.
. With your project open, search the Studio palette for the FTPS connector you should have already installed. Drag and drop a new FTPS connector onto the canvas.
. Drag and drop a *Logger* after the FTPS element to log incoming messages in the console.
+
image:read_flow.png[Read flow]
+
. Double click the flow's header and rename it `read-flow`.
+
image:read_flow_config.png[Read flow configuration]
+
. Double click the FTPS connector element, and configure its properties as follows:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Value
|Display Name |FTPS (Streaming)
|Consumer Configuration |"FTPS_Basic_config" (default name of a configuration, or any other configuration that you configured as explained in the link:#configuring[Configuration] section.
|Operation |Read
|Directory to move to | The directory where to move the files after they are read from the server. If left empty, the files are deleted.
|File name | File name pattern for the files to be read.
|Maximum concurrent reads | The number of threads (connections) to use to read files.
|ASCII Data Type | Whether the files to be read are in ASCII or BINARY - the default is BINARY.
|Streaming | Whether to send an InputStream as the message payload (if true) or as a byte array (if false). The default is false.
|Pooling period | The interval to query the server for files.
|===
+
image:read.png[Read operation]
+
. Select the logger and set its fields as follows:
+
image:logger.png[Logger]
+
. Deploy the app on Studio's embedded Mule Runtime (Run As > Mule Application). When a new 
file matching your file name pattern appears, you should see its content logged in the console.

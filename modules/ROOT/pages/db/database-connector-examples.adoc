These Database Connector examples help you configure database connections, configure connection pools, query the database, and execute stored procedures, DDL statements, and bulk operations. 

== Configure a Database Connection

The Database Connector can connect to any database for which a JDBC driver is available. To make it easier to connect to the most popular databases (such as MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server), the connector includes a series of different connection types.

The generic connection type is useful in these cases:

* When you want to connect to a database for which MuleSoft does not provide a specific connection type.
* When you want to connect to one of the supported databases, but you are using custom options that are not included in the connection types.

A generic connection requires:

* Driver class name
* Connection URL

Some of these examples show configurations for common connection types. You can also use this connector for more advanced use cases, such as connecting to a global data source, configuring a JDBC driver, and configuring connection pooling.

=== Connect to MySQL

This example shows how to connect to a MySQL database:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<db:config name="dbConfig">
  <db:my-sql-connection
  host="0.0.0.0"
  port="3306"
  user="Max"
  password="POWERS"
  database="someSchema"/>
</db:config>
----

=== Connect to Oracle

This example shows how to connect to an Oracle database:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<db:config name="dbConfig">
  <db:oracle-connection
  host="192.168.99.100"
  port="1521" instance="xe"
  user="system"
  password="oracle" />
</db :config >
----

=== Connect to Microsoft SQL Server

This example shows how to connect to a Microsoft SQL Server database:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<db:config name="dbConfig">
    <db:mssql-connection
    host="0.0.0.0"
    port="553"
    user="Max"
    password="mypassword"
    databaseName="microsoftDB" />
</db:config>
----

[[generic_db]]
=== Connect to a Generic Database

This example shows how to connect to an H2 database:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<db:config name="dbConfig">
    <db:generic-connection driverClassName="org.h2.Driver"
    url="jdbc:h2:file:/tmp/datasenseDB"/>
</db:config>
----

=== Connect to a Global DataSource

When you set up a <<generic_db, generic connection>>, the connector uses the information you provide to generate a JDBC `DataSource`. In some cases, you might want to create your own `DataSource`. To do this, the database configuration supports a `data-source-connection` element that allows you to reference a `DataSource` that is defined through the Spring module.

To connect to a global `DataSource`:

. Create a Spring configuration file containing a Bean such as this one:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<bean id="jdbcDataSource" class="org.enhydra.jdbc.standard.StandardDataSource"
 destroy-method="shutdown">
   <property name="driverName" value="org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver"/>
   <property name="url" value="jdbc:derby:muleEmbeddedDB;create=true"/>
</bean>
----
+
The previous example creates a custom enhydra `DataSource` that connects to a Derby database.
+
. Reference your Spring configuration file using the Spring module, and use the `DataSource` in a connection:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<spring:config name="datasource" files="datasource-config.xml" />

<db:config name="dbConfig">
   <db:data-source-connection dataSourceRef="jdbcDataSource" />
</db:config>
----

=== Set the JDBC Driver

After you configure the connections, you can supply the JDBC driver. The following example shows how to supply a driver for the MySQL database.

Other than the need to specify a driver dependency, the steps are the same as for any other database. 

. Add the driver as a dependency in your project's `pom.xml` file:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>mysql</groupId>
    <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
    <version>5.1.6</version>
</dependency>
----
+
. Through your `pom.xml`, make Mule expose the driver dependency to the Database Connector, for example:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<build>
    <plugins>
        <!-- Only used to declare the shared libraries-->
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.mule.tools.maven</groupId>
            <artifactId>mule-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>1.0.0</version>
            <configuration>
                <sharedLibraries>
                    <sharedLibrary>
                        <groupId>mysql</groupId>
                        <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
                    </sharedLibrary>
                </sharedLibraries>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
----

=== Configure Connection Pools

Establishing connections is costly in terms of connector and relational database management system (RDBMS) network and processing overhead. The solution is to build a connection pool that provides several available connections. Use the `<db:pooling-profile>` element, rather than the standard Mule `<pooling-profile>` element, for this purpose.

This example shows how to use the `db:pooling-profile` element:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<db:config name="dbConfig">
    <db:my-sql-connection database="mozart_test" host="${host}" password="${password}" port="${port}" user="${user}">
        <db:pooling-profile acquireIncrement="1" maxPoolSize="5" maxWait="0" maxWaitUnit="SECONDS" minPoolSize="0" preparedStatementCacheSize="5"/>
    </db:my-sql-connection>
</db:config>
----

All connection configuration elements, except the global data source reference, accept the pooling profile. In JDBC, pooling occurs at the data source level. To do pooling, you have to configure the global data source. The software cannot add it on the fly.

Unlike other connectors such as FTP or SFTP, the Database Connector uses the `<db:pooling-profile>` instead of the standard `<pooling-profile>`. This is because databases have special pooling attributes, such as `preparedStatementCacheSize`.

For further information about parameters and connection type capabilities, see xref:db/database-documentation.adoc[the Database Connector Reference].

=== Create an Oracle Database Connection with TNS Names

To create an Oracle connection that relies on the `tnsnames.ora` file, use the Database Connector and provide configuration details in the
connector configuration. For this to work you have to add the http://download.oracle.com/otn/utilities_drivers/jdbc/11204/ojdbc6.jar[ojdbc6.jar] file
as a dependency in your project build path.

If a firewall is between your Mule instance and the database, use the `ENABLE=BROKEN` parameter to enable a keep-alive connection at the TNS connection. If a keep-alive connection is not set, the connection might drop traffic due to expiring inactivity timers.

For example, you can configure a database URL in the Database
Connector's *General* tab in Anypoint Studio, and supply this URL:

`jdbc:oracle:thin:${oracle.user}/${oracle.password}@(DESCRIPTION=(ENABLE=BROKEN)(FAILOVER=ON)(ADDRESS_LIST=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=${oracle.host1})(PORT=${oracle.port}))(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=${oracle.host2})(PORT=${oracle.port}))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=${oracle.service})))`

== Query a Database

When you configure a database operation using the Database Connector, there are several ways to add variable values to the SQL statement you execute in the database.

=== Use Input Parameters to Protect Database Queries

Use the `select` operation to retrieve information from the RDBMS. The primary goal of this operation is to supply a SQL query and use DataWeave to supply the parameters:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="selectParameterizedQuery">
  <db:select config-ref="dbConfig">
    <db:sql>SELECT * FROM PLANET WHERE name = :name</db:sql>
    <db:input-parameters>
      #[{'name' : payload}]
    </db:input-parameters>
  </db:select>
</flow>
----

In this example, you supply input parameters as key-value pairs, which you create by embedding a DataWeave script. The keys are used with the colon character (`:`) to reference a parameter value by name. This is the recommended approach for using parameters in your query. 

The advantages of using input parameters to configure the `WHERE` clause in a `SELECT` statement are that it makes the query immune to SQL injection attacks and enables optimizations that are not possible otherwise, which improves the app’s overall performance.

[NOTE]
====
*Since version 1.4.0 (escaping colons)*:
If you need to use the colon character (`:`) in your SQL query, you can escape it
by putting a backslash before it. This is useful when using PostgreSQL type
casting, which requires two colons before the type you are casting to, for example:

`<db:sql>SELECT price\:\:float8 FROM PRODUCT</db:sql>`
====

For security reasons, do not directly write `<db:sql>SELECT * FROM PLANET WHERE name = #[payload] </db:sql>`.

DataSense is available for the operation's input and output. The connector analyzes the query and automatically calculates the structure of the query's output by analyzing the projection section of the SQL statement. At the same time, by comparing the conditions in the `WHERE` clause to the table structure, it generates DataSense input to help you build the DataWeave script that generates the input parameters.

=== Dynamic Queries

Sometimes, you need to parameterize not only the `WHERE` clause, but also parts of the query itself. Examples of use cases for this are queries that need to access online versus historic tables that depend on a condition, or complex queries for which the project table columns need to vary.

In the following example, you can see how a full expression is used to produce the query by building a string in which the table depends on a variable `$(vars.table)`. An important thing to notice is that although some of the query text is dynamic (`"SELECT * FROM $(vars.table)`), the `WHERE` clause is still using the best practice of defining the `WHERE` condition using input parameters, in this case, `WHERE name = :name`:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<set-variable variableName="table" value="PLANET"/>
<db:select config-ref="dbConfig">
    <db:sql>#["SELECT * FROM $(vars.table) WHERE name = :name"]</db:sql>
    <db:input-parameters>
        #[{'name' : payload}]
    </db:input-parameters>
</db:select>
----

Dynamic queries are necessary in the above example and cannot be treated like Input parameters; Input parameters can be applied only to parameters in a `WHERE` clause. To modify any other part of the query, you should use DataWeave’s interpolation operator.

[NOTE]
In Mule 3, the concept of select was split in parameterized and dynamic queries, and you couldn’t use both at the same time. You had to choose between having a dynamic query or having the advantages of using parameters (SQL Injection protection, PreparedStatement optimization, and so on). Furthermore, the syntax to do one or the other was different, so you had to learn two different ways of doing the same thing. But with the Database Connector in Mule 4, you can now use both methods at the same time by using expressions in the query.


=== Stream Large Results

Use streaming with queries that return many records, such as in integration use cases. In Mule 4, streaming is transparent and always enabled. 

For example, if you submit a query that returns 10K rows, attempting to fetch all those rows at once results in both performance degradation, due to the big pull from the network, and the risk of running out of memory, since all the information must be loaded into RAM. 

With streaming, the connector fetches and processes only part of the query at one time, which reduces load on the network and memory.  This means that the connector does not fetch the 10K rows at once; instead, it fetches a smaller chunk, and once that chunk is consumed, it fetches the rest. 

You can also use the new repeatable streams mechanism, which means you can have DataWeave and other components process the same stream many times, even in parallel. For more information on repeatable streams, see Streaming in Mule 4.0.

=== Limit Results

Mule allows the connector to handle streaming gracefully. However, that does not mean that it's a good idea to move large chunks of data from the database to Mule. Even with streaming, a typical SQL query can return many rows, each one containing a lot of information.

The `select` operation provides parameters (`fetchSize` and `maxRows`) to help with this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<db:select fetchSize="200" maxRows="1000" config-ref="dbConfig">
  <db:sql>select * from some_table</db:sql>
</db:select>
----

This syntax instructs the connector to fetch no more than 1000 rows (the `maxRows` value), no more than 200 rows at a time (the `fetchSize` value), significantly reducing network and memory load. The `fetchSize` value is enforced differently by different JDBC driver providers and often defaults to `10`.

The combination limits the total amount of information that is retrieved (the `maxRows` value) and guarantees that the data is returned from the database over the network in smaller chunks (the `fetchSize` value).


=== Query Timeout

Sometimes database queries take a long time to execute. The following factors often cause delays in query execution:

* An inefficient query, such as one having improper indexing that iterates over many rows
* A busy RDBMS or network
* A lock contention

Generally, it's recommended to set a timeout on the query. To manage timeouts, configure `queryTimeout` and `queryTimeoutUnit`. The following example shows how to set a timeout for the Select operation, but all operations support setting a timeout:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<db:select queryTimeout="0" queryTimeoutUnit="SECONDS" config-ref="dbConfig">
   <db:sql>select * from some_table</db:sql>
</db:select>
----

== Insert, Update, and Delete Data with the Database Connector

The Database Connector supports `insert`, `update`, and `delete` operations.
Similar to the select operation, these operations support dynamic queries and
parameterization by using embedded DataWeave transformations while also
supporting `fetchSize`, `maxRows`, and `timeout` parameters. Although examples of input
parameterization, dynamic queries, and parameter usage are provided, you can consult
the `SELECT` operation documentation for more information.

=== Insert

Suppose there is a database schema named `Products` that has a table named
`electronic`. The `electronic` table contains columns named `id`, `name`, `description`, `price`, and `discount`.

The following SQL statement creates the table:

[source,sql,linenums]
----
CREATE TABLE electronic(
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    description VARCHAR(255),
    price SMALLINT,
    discount TINYINT
)
----

For an example of creating a table using the Database Connector, check how to <<execute_ddl_statements,Execute DDL Statements>>.

Given that the table is already created and there is a connection configuration named `dbConfig`,
the following operation inserts a new record in the `electronic` table:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<db:insert config-ref="dbConfig">
  <db:sql>
    INSERT INTO electronic(name, description, price, discount)
    VALUES ('Coffee Machine', 'Model: XYZ99. Uses small size capsules.', 120, 5)
  </db:sql>
</db:insert>
----

The `id` parameter is not passed in the query because it is an
autoincrement key that is generated automatically by the database.

[NOTE]
====
To benefit from the advantages of input parameters,
structure the equivalent query as follows:
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<db:insert config-ref="dbConfig">
    <db:sql>
        INSERT INTO electronic(name, description, price, discount)
        VALUES (:name, :description, :price, :discount)
    </db:sql>
    <db:input-parameters>#[{
        name: 'Coffee Machine',
        description: 'Model:XYZ99. Uses small size capsules.',
        price: 120,
        discount: 5}]
    </db:input-parameters>
</db:insert>
----
====

The insert operation outputs a `Statement Result` object that contains two fields: an `affectedRows`
integer that indicates how many rows were affected by the query, and a `generatedKeys` map
that contains the autogenerated keys. In this example, the output is as follows:

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "affectedRows": 1,
  "generatedKeys": {

  }
}
----

The `generatedKeys` map is empty, although a row is successfully added to the table.
The map is empty because this information is disabled by default to avoid overhead.
To activate the information and generate keys, add the `autoGenerateKeys` parameter, and then set it to `true`:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<db:insert config-ref="dbConfig" autoGenerateKeys="true">
   <db:sql>
       INSERT INTO electronic(name, description, price, discount)
       VALUES (:name, :description, :price, :discount)
   </db:sql>
   <db:input-parameters>#[{
       name: 'Coffee Machine',
       description: 'Model:XYZ99. Uses small size capsules.',
       price: 120,
       discount: 5}]
   </db:input-parameters>
</db:insert>
----

If the statement generates multiple keys per affected row, you can specify which columns
should be returned by setting the parameter `autoGeneratedKeysColumnNames` to a list that contains
the desired column names. For example, to ensure that only the `id` column is
returned, set the parameter to a DataWeave list with a single string element:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<db:insert config-ref="dbConfig" autoGenerateKeys="true" autoGeneratedKeysColumnNames="#[['id']]">
    ...
</db:insert>
----

=== Update

Given the table that is defined in the insert example, the operation to update the `electronic` table
to set the discount to 10 percent for all items that have a price value above 100 is:

[literal,source,xml,linenums]
....
<db:update config-ref="dbConfig">
    <db:sql><![CDATA[#["UPDATE electronic SET discount = :discount WHERE price > :price"]]]></db:sql>
	<db:input-parameters>#[{
        discount: 10,
        price: 100
    }]</db:input-parameters>
</db:update>
....

The `<![CDATA[...]]>` wrapper allows you to use special characters, such as `>` or `"`, in the query.
Otherwise, you must use XML-escaped versions of those characters, such as `+&gt;+` and  `+&quot;+`.

When you use the Anypoint Studio visual user interface for connectors instead of the XML code view, you can type special characters directly into the `SQL Query Text` box, and Anypoint Studio automatically
changes the character to its escaped version in the XML view.

=== Delete

Given the table defined in the example for `insert`, the following operation
 deletes the record with `id: 1` from the table:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<db:delete config-ref="dbConfig">
    <db:sql>DELETE FROM electronic WHERE id = :id</db:sql>
    <db:input-parameters>#[{
        id: 1
    }]</db:input-parameters>
</db:delete>
----

== Execute Stored Procedures

Invoke stored procedures that combine `input`, `output``, and `input-output` parameters.

For example:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<!-- Invoke a procedure with input parameters -->
<db:stored-procedure config-ref="dbConfig">
    <db:sql>{ call updatePlanetDescription('Venus', :description) }</db:sql>
    <db:input-parameters>
        #[{'description' : payload}]
    </db:input-parameters>
</db:stored-procedure>

<!-- Invoke a procedure with input-output parameters -->
<db:stored-procedure config-ref="dbConfig">
  <db:sql>{ call doubleMyInt(:myInt) }</db:sql>
  <db:in-out-parameters>
      <db:in-out-parameter key="myInt" value="3"/>
  </db:in-out-parameters>
</db:stored-procedure>

<!-- Invoke a procedure with both input AND output parameters -->
<db:stored-procedure config-ref="dbConfig">
    <db:sql>{ call multiplyInts(:int1, :int2, :result1, :int3, :result2) }</db:sql>
    <db:input-parameters>
        #[{
            'int1' : 3,
            'int2' : 4,
            'int3' : 5
        }]
    </db:input-parameters>
    <db:output-parameters>
        <db:output-parameter key="result1" type="INTEGER"/>
        <db:output-parameter key="result2" type="INTEGER"/>
        <db:output-parameter key="myInt" type="INTEGER"/>
    </db:output-parameters>
</db:stored-procedure>
----

Many combinations are possible.

After execution, the resulting values of the `output` and `input-output` parameters are available in the operation's result. Leverage DataSense to help you get them.

For Database Connector version 1.4.0 or later, make sure that no whitespace is between the name of the stored procedure and the first parentheses.

[[execute_ddl_statements]]
== Execute DDL Statements

Data Definition Language (DDL) statements, are special types of SQL statements that do not directly access or modify data. Instead, they create, modify, or destroy data structures, stored procedures, and so on. You can also use DDL statements to create or modify data within tables or other data structures.


=== Create Table Example

Suppose you have a database schema named `Products`. You also have a
connection named `dbConfig` that is configured to access `Products`.
The following operation, named `Execute DDL`, creates a new table named `electronic` that has
columns named `id`, `name`, `description`, `price`, and `discount`:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<db:execute-ddl config-ref="dbConfig">
    <db:sql>
        CREATE TABLE electronic(
            id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
            name VARCHAR(100),
            description VARCHAR(255),
            price SMALLINT,
            discount TINYINT
        )
    </db:sql>
</db:execute-ddl>
----

The `Execute DDL` operation creates a table and returns `0` unless there is an error.

== Execute Bulk Operations

The `insert`, `update`, and `delete` operations can be used for the cases in which each input parameter can take only one value. Alternatively, bulk operations allow you to run a single query using a set of parameters values.

You can avoid unnecessary steps by doing a bulk operation so that:

* The query is parsed only once.
* Only one database connection is required since a single statement is executed.
* Network overhead is minimized.
* RDBMS can execute the bulk operation atomically.

For these use cases, the connector offers three operations: `<db:bulk-insert>`, `<db:bulk-update>` and `<db:bulk-delete>`.

These operations are similar to their single counterparts, except that instead of receiving input parameters as key-value pairs,
the operations expect them as a list of key-value pairs.

For example:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<db:bulk-insert config-ref="dbConfig" >
  <db:bulk-input-parameters>
    #[[{'id': 2, 'name': 'George', 'lastName': 'Costanza'}, {'id': 3, 'name': 'Cosmo', 'lastName': 'Kramer'}]]
  </db:bulk-input-parameters>
  <db:sql>
    insert into customers (id, name, lastName) values (:id, :name, :lastName)
  </db:sql>
</db:bulk-insert>
----

If you don't use bulk operations, when performing a `delete` operation, many rows could match the criteria and get deleted if only one criteria `(POSITION = X)` is provided. 
The same concept applies for update. If you use `UPDATE PRODUCTS set PRICE = PRICE * 0.9 where PRICE > :price`, you may want to apply a 10% discount on many products, but the `price` input parameter accepts only one value.

If you want to apply different discount rates on products that have different prices, you can do so by executing many operations.

For example, assume you have a payload, which is a list of objects of the following structure `{ price : number, discountRate: number}`:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<foreach>
  <db:update config-ref="dbConfig">
    <db:input-parameters>
     #[
      {
        'discountRate' : payload.discountRate,
        'price' : payload.price,
      }
    ]
    </db:input-parameters>
    <db:sql>
      UPDATE PRODUCTS set PRICE = PRICE * :discountRate where PRICE > :price
    </db:sql>
  </db:update>
</foreach>
----

The previous operation accomplishes the task but is inefficient. For each element in the list, one query needs to be executed for each element of the operation:

* The query is parsed. 
* Parameters are resolved.
* A connection to the database is acquired (either by getting one for the pool or establishing a new one).
* All the network overhead is paid.
* The RDBMS processes the query and applies changes.
* The connection is released.


== Database Connector Data Types Reference

The following examples include information about database input parameters and defining custom data types you can use when connected to a particular connection provider.

=== Force Parameter Types

Under uncommon circumstances, you might need to force the underlying JDBC driver to coerce an input parameter to a specific type. For example, if your JDBC driver cannot determine the type of the input, or a parameter is of a custom type, you might need to apply force by specifying the type of each input parameter:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<db:bulk-insert queryTimeout="0" queryTimeoutUnit="SECONDS">
     <db:sql>INSERT INTO PLANET(POSITION, NAME) VALUES (:position, :name)</db:sql>
     <db:parameter-types>
         <db:parameter-type key="name" type="VARCHAR" />
         <db:parameter-type key="position" type="INTEGER" />
     </db:parameter-types>
 </db:bulk-insert>
----

=== Define Custom Data Types

The Database Connector Reference describes exclusive and common parameters for each connection provider, such as Derby and Oracle. A child element of the connection provider element defines custom data types you can use when connected to a particular provider. For example:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<db:config name="dbConfig">
   <db:derby-connection url="jdbc:derby:muleEmbeddedDB;create=true">
       <db:column-types>
           <!-- Derby uses JAVA_OBJECT for UDT-->
           <db:column-type typeName="CONTACT_DETAILS" id="2000"/>
       </db:column-types>
   </db:derby-connection>
</db:config>
----

== Database Transactions

You can execute database operations in the context of a transaction. Each operation has a `transactionalAction` value that specifies the type of joining action that operations can take regarding the active transaction if there is one. For example, the `select` operation has the following possible actions:

* `ALWAYS_JOIN` +  
Expects a transaction to be in progress when a message is received. If there is no transaction, an error is raised.
* `JOIN_IF_POSSIBLE` +
Joins the current transaction if one is available. Otherwise, no transaction occurs.
* `NOT_SUPPORTED` +
Executes outside any existing transaction.

=== Group Operations

Sometimes you need to execute several queries atomically in the context of the same transaction. For example, during a bank account transfer, you need to subtract money from one account and add it in another, but if any of the two operations fail, roll back both:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<db:update config-ref=”db”>
 <db:sql>UPDATE ACCOUNT set BALANCE = BALANCE - :money where ID = :source</db:sql>
 <db:input-parameters>#[{‘money’ : payload.money, ‘source’: payload.source}]</db:input-parameters>
</db:update>

If these queries are executed in the context of an already existing transaction, the queries belong to the same transaction. If there’s no active transaction, you can start one by using the `<try>` scope:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<try transactionalAction="ALWAYS_BEGIN">
 <db:update config-ref="db">
   <db:sql>UPDATE ACCOUNT set BALANCE = BALANCE - :money where ID = :source</db:sql>
   <db:input-parameters>#[{'money' : payload.money, 'source': payload.source}]</db:input-parameters>
 </db:update>

 <db:update config-ref="db">
   <db:sql>UPDATE ACCOUNT set BALANCE = BALANCE + :money where ID = :target</db:sql>
   <db:input-parameters>#[{'money' : payload.money, 'target'': payload.target}]</db:input-parameters>
 </db:update>
</try>

== Execute Script Reference

This operation executes a script of random length as a single statement. Execute script differs from other operations in the following ways:

* The script can contain multiple statements.
* Statements can be of different types.
* No input/output parameters are accepted.

The `execute-script` operation runs any script that does not involve a SQL projection. You can use `<db:execute-script>` in the following ways:

* Embed execute-script in an operation.
* Reference execute-script from a file.

You cannot use both ways of executing a script at the same time.

Executing a script returns an array of integer numbers, one element per each executed statement. Each number represents the number of objects affected by the statement.

=== Embed in an Operation

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<db:execute-script config-ref="dbConfig">
   <db:sql>
       update PLANET set NAME='Mercury' where POSITION=0;
       update PLANET set NAME='Mercury' where POSITION=4
   </db:sql>
</db:execute-script>
----

=== Reference From a File

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="executeScriptFromFile">
   <db:execute-script config-ref="dbConfig" file="integration/executescript/bulk-script.sql" />
</flow>
----

The execute script operation frequently creates schemas and tables, inserts data, and performs data rotation. Data rotation is performed by nightly jobs that move and archive data into historic tables and purge on-line tables.

Execute script and bulk operations are intended for different uses.  For example, although you can build a script that inserts many rows into the database, you could not conveniently provide dynamic parameters to the script. Also, you need to ensure that the script protects against a SQL injection attack.

Executing a select statement in a script returns no data and poses a data input problem.

= Use Studio to Configure VM Connector 2.0 - Mule 4

Anypoint Studio (Studio) editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.

To add and configure a connector in Studio:

. <<create-mule-project,Create a Mule project>>.
. <<add-connector-to-project,Add the connector to your Mule project>>.
. <<configure-input-source,Configure a source for the connector's flow>>.
. <<add-connector-operation,Add a connector operation to the flow>>.
. <<configure-global-element,Configure a global element for the connector>>.

When you run the connector, you can view the app log to check for problems, as described in <<view-app-log,View the App Log>>.

If you are new to configuring connectors in Studio, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-config-use-studio.adoc[Using Anypoint Studio to Configure a Connector]. If, after reading this topic, you need additional information about the connector fields, see xref:vm-reference.adoc[VM Connector Reference].

[[create-mule-project]]
== Create a Mule Project

In Studio, create a new Mule project in which to add and configure the connector:

. In Studio, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
. Enter a name for your Mule project and click *Finish*.


[[add-connector-to-project]]
== Add the Connector to Your Mule Project

Add VM Connector to your Mule project to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location and to add the required dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In the *Add Dependencies to Project* window, type `vm connector` in the search field.
. Click *VM Connector* in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.


[[configure-input-source]]
== Configure a Source

A source initiates a flow when a specified condition is met.
You can configure one of these input sources to use with VM Connector:

* *VM Listener*, which initiates a flow by listening on a VM queue
* *HTTP Listener*, which initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port
* *Scheduler*, which initiates a flow when a time-based condition is met

For example, to configure a *VM Listener* source, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *VM > Listener*.
. Drag *Listener* to the Studio canvas.
. On the *Listener* configuration screen, optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. Click the plus sign (+) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a VM queue that can be used by all instances of the *Listener* source and other VM Connector operations in the app.
. <<configure-global-element,Define the VM queue>>.
. On the *Listener* configuration screen, set the *Number of consumers* field to your desired value (default is `4`). +
. In the *Queue* section, select a *Queue name* from the drop-down menu. +
If you previously created a VM queue, the *Queue name* value appears automatically.
. Specify a value for the *Timeout* (default is `5`).
. Select a *Timeout unit* from the drop-down menu.

[[add-connector-operation]]
== Add a Connector Operation to the Flow

When you add a connector operation to your flow, you immediately define a specific operation for that connector to perform.

To add an operation for VM Connector, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *VM Connector* and then select the desired operation.
. Drag the operation onto the Studio canvas and to the right of the input source.

[[configure-global-element]]
== Configure a Global Element for the Connector
When you configure a connector, it’s best to configure a global element that all instances of that connector in the app can use. A VM Connector global configuration defines the queues on which the connector operates. You can define any number of configurations, each with its own set of queues. +

Each queue defined within a given VM Connector configuration can be used only by operations referencing that specific configuration. A queue name cannot be repeated across configurations, and two queues with the same name can not exist in the same app or domain.

To configure the global element for VM Connector, follow these steps:

. Select the name of the connector in the Studio canvas.
. In the configuration screen for the operation, click the plus sign (+) next to the *Connector configuration* field to access the global element configuration fields.
. In the *General* section, in the *Queues* drop-down menu select either:

* `Bean reference` +
+
In the *Bean reference* field, add your desired reference value.

* `Edit inline` +
+
In the *Queues* field, click the plus sign (+) to add a new queue. Then add a *Queue name* value, set *Queue type* to either `TRANSIENT (Default)` or `PERSISTENT`, add a value for *Max outstanding messages*; and click *Finish*.

[start=4]
. In the *Connection* section, optionally configure a reconnection strategy.
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally configure an expiration policy.
. Click *OK*.

The following screenshot shows an example of configuring the VM Connector:

The following screenshot shows an example of configuring the VM queue:

.VM Queue Configuration
image::vm-studio-config2.png[VM Queue Configuration]

In the XML editor, the VM Connector configuration looks like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<vm:config name="VM_Config">
    <vm:queues>
        <vm:queue queueName="transientQUEUE" queueType="TRANSIENT" />
        <vm:queue queueName="persistentQUEUE" queueType="PERSISTENT" />
    </vm:queues>
</vm:config>
----

[[view-app-log]]

== View the App Log

To check for problems, you can view the app log as follows:

* If you’re running the app from Anypoint Platform, the output is visible in the Anypoint Studio console window.
* If you’re running the app using Mule from the command line, the app log is visible in your OS console.

Unless the log file path is customized in the app’s log file (`log4j2.xml`), you can also view the app log in the default location `MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`.

VM Connector v2.0

Anypoint Connector for Virtual Machine (VM) (VM Connector) provides intra-app and inter-app communication through transient or persistent asynchronous queues. Transient queues are faster, but not as reliable as persistent queues if the system crashes. Persistent queues, on the other hand, are slower but reliable.

When running on a single instance, persistent queues work by serializing and storing the contents on to disk. When running in cluster mode, persistent queues are instead backed by the memory grid. This means that when a Mule flow uses VM Connector to publish content to a queue, Mule runtime engine (Mule) decides whether to process that message in the same origin node or to send it out to the cluster to be picked up and processed by another node. This is an easy way to distribute load across the cluster and ensure that transactions are always supported.

Each configuration defines its own set of queues, which are visible only to components referencing that configuration.

[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%,.^20%,^.^5%", options="header"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required

== Associated Operations

* <<consume>>
* <<publish>>
* <<publishConsume>>

== Associated Sources

* <<listener>>


== Operations

[[consume]]
=== Consume
`<vm:consume>`

This operation pulls a message from a queue. If a message is not immediately available, the Consume operation waits for up to the configured `queueTimeout` value, after which a `VM:QUEUE_TIMEOUT` error is thrown.

The flow in which the content is consumed cannot contain a Listener (`<vm:listener>`) source.

| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Configuration | String | The name of the configuration to use. | | x
| Transactional Action a| Enumeration, one of:

** ALWAYS_JOIN: The current operation joins to the current transactions. If a transaction doesn't exist or is not compatible with the operation, the execution fails.
** JOIN_IF_POSSIBLE: The current operation joins to available transactions. If there is no transaction to join, the current operation executes outside of existing transactions.
** NOT_SUPPORTED: The current operation executes outside of existing transactions.
|  The type of joining action that operations can take regarding transactions. |  JOIN_IF_POSSIBLE |
| Queue Name a| String |  The name of the queue. |  | x
| Timeout a| Number |  How long to wait for the queue to complete an operation (either publishing or consuming) before failing with a timeout error. The default is 5 seconds. |  5 |

| Target Variable a| String |  The name of a variable in which the operation's output is placed. |  |
| Target Value a| String |  An expression that evaluates against the operations's output. The outcome of this expression is stored in the target variable. |  #[payload] |
| Reconnection Strategy a| * <<reconnect>>
* <<reconnect-forever>> |  A retry strategy in case of connectivity errors. |  |

[[publishConsume]]
=== Publish Consume

`<vm:publish-consume>`

This operation publishes the provided content into a queue, and then waits up to the time configured in `queueTimeout` for a response to be supplied on a temporal reply-To queue that this operation creates automatically.

The temporal reply-To queue is automatically disposed of after a response is received or the timeout expires.

The flow in which the content is published cannot contain a Listener (`<vm:listener>`) source.

== Sources

[[listener]]

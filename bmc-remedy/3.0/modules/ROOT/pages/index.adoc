== Add the Connector to a Studio Project

Anypoint Studio provides two ways to add the connector to your Studio project: from the Exchange button in the Studio taskbar or from the Mule Palette view.

=== Add the Connector Using Exchange

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. Click the Exchange icon *(X)* in the upper-left of the Studio task bar.
. In Exchange, click *Login* and supply your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. In Exchange, search for "bmc".
. Select the connector and click *Add to project*.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

=== Add the Connector in Studio

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. In the Mule Palette view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Modules to Project*, type "bmc" in the search field.
. Click this connector's name in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

=== Configure in Studio

. Click the Global Elements tab at the base of the canvas.
. In the Global Mule Configuration Elements screen, click Create.
. In the Choose Global Type wizard, expand Connector Configuration and select Remedy Configuration and click OK.
+
image::bmc-remedy-global-configuration.png[Global Element Configuration Wizard]
+
. Configure the parameters according to instructions below.
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|Name |Enter a name for the configuration to reference it.
|Username |Enter the user name.
|Password |Enter the password.
|Server |Enter the IP address of the AR server responsible for handling login requests.
|Server Port | Enter the port number at which the AR server is configured to handle the requests.
|Authentication |Enter the authentication string alias. The Authentication String Alias can be used to identify the correct authentication domain for the user.
|Locale | Enter the locale.
|===
+
The placeholder values refer to a configuration file `mule-artifact.properties` placed in the
`src/main/resources` folder of your project.
You can either enter your credentials into the global configuration properties,
or reference a configuration file that contains these values. For simpler maintenance and better re-usability of your
project, Mule recommends that you use a configuration file. Keeping these values in a separate file is useful if you
need to deploy to different environments, such as production, development, and QA, where your access credentials differ.
+
. Keep the Advanced tab which has Reconnection strategy with their default entries.
. Click Test Connection to confirm that the parameters of your
global configuration are accurate, and that Mule is
able to successfully connect to your instance of BMC Remedy AR System.
. Click OK to save the global connector configurations.
. Your configuration should look like this:
+
image::bmc-remedy-connection-config-properties.png[Remedy use case config]

== XML and Maven Support

When you add the connector to your project in Studio, the namespace, schema location, and POM file information automatically are created for you. If you want to create a Mule app without using Studio, use this information:

Namespace: `+http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/remedy+` +
Schema Location: `+http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/remedy/current/mule-remedy.xsd+`

POM file information:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.mulesoft.connectors</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-bmc-remedy-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
</dependency>
----

Replace `x.x.x` with the version that corresponds to the connector you are using.

== Use Case: Create a User

This Mule flow creates a user in the BMC Remedy AR System using the Create operation.

image::bmc-remedy-create-user-flow.png[Creating a User]

. Create a new Mule Project in Anypoint Studio.
. Add the following properties to the `mule-artifact.properties` file to hold your Remedy credentials and place it in the project's `src/main/resources` directory.
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
config.username=<Username>
config.password=<Password>
config.server=<Server>
config.serverPort=<Server Port>
----
+
. Drag an HTTP Listener component onto the canvas and configure the following parameters:
+
image::bmc-remedy-http-props.png[Remedy HTTP config properties]
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Parameter |Value

|Extension Configuration | If no HTTP Listener configuration has been created yet, click the plus sign to add a new HTTP Listener Configuration. Specify the Host as localhost and the Port with the 8081 value.
|Path |/createUser
|===
+
. Drag Transform Message component next to the HTTP Listener and
specify the necessary data.
+
The data mapping should be like this:
+
image::bmc-remedy-transform-message.png[Remedy HTTP config props]
+
. Drag the Remedy Connector Create operation next to the Transform Message component from the Mule Palette.
. Configure the Remedy connector by adding a new Remedy Global Element. Click the plus sign next to the Connector Configuration field.
. Configure the global element according to the table below:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Parameter |Description | Value
|Name |Enter a name for the configuration to reference it. |`<Configuration_Name>`
|Username |Enter the Username | `${config.username}`
|Password |Enter the Password | `${config.password}`
|Server |Enter the IP of the AR server responsible for handling login requests. | `${config.server}`
|Server Port | Enter the port number on which the AR server is configured to handle the requests. | `${config.serverPort}`
|===
+
Your configuration should look like this:
+
image::bmc-remedy-connection-config-properties.png[Remedy use case config]
+
The corresponding XML configuration should be as follows:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<remedy:config name="Remedy_Configuration" doc:name="Remedy Configuration">
	<remedy:basic-connection
	username="${config.username}"
	password="${config.password}"
	server="${config.server}"
	serverPort="${config.serverPort}" />
</remedy:config>
----
+
. Click Test Connection to confirm that Mule can connect with the BMC Remedy AR system instance. If the connection is successful, click OK to save the configuration. Otherwise, review or correct any incorrect parameters, then test again.
. In the properties editor of the Remedy Create operation, configure the remaining parameters:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Parameter |Value
|Display Name |Create (or any other name you prefer).

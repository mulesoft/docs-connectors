= Google Drive Connector 1.1 - Mule 4



Anypoint Connector for Google Drive (Google Drive Connector) enables you to automate business processes between Google Drive (Drive) and other enterprise applications, either on premises or in the cloud. Using the Google Drive connector, you can programmatically access and upload content and relevant information to and from Drive.

Drive enables you to store and back up all of your files in the cloud, including documents, slides, images, audio, and video. It integrates seamlessly with cloud-native apps that enable your teams to collaborate effectively in real time, using apps like Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides.

For compatibility information and fixed issues, see the Google Drive Connector Release Notes.

To use this connector, you should be familiar with:

* The Google Drive API

* Elements and global elements in a Mule flow
* Creating a Mule app using Anypoint Studio (Studio)

Before creating an app, you must have:

== Common Use Cases for the Connector

Automate powerful business processes by integrating Google Drive with other enterprise IT tools and systems, such as messaging, CRM, and ITSM. Possibilities include:

* Improving sales operations
+
Automate contract approval processes so that when a sales contract is received in the Salesforce CRM system, it is automatically uploaded to Drive and shared with the deal desk or other teams for their review.
* Enhancing cross-team collaboration
+
Automatically notify all relevant teams and team members via Slack or Microsoft Teams and email when new content, such as product specs, contracts, and legal addendums, is uploaded to a given folder in Drive.
* Securing your enterprise content
+
Automatically upload properly secured content from other enterprise systems, such as CRM, email, and marketing tools, to Drive folders. This minimizes IP leaks by making Drive the single source of truth for all of your content.

== Authentication Types

Google Drive Connector uses the OAuth 2.0 authentication connection type, which uses access tokens provided by the authorization server to access protected data.

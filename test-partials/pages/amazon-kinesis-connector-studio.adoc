=== Configure a Source

A source initiates a flow when a specified condition is met.
You can configure one of these sources to use with Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Connector:

* *Listener*
+
Enables you to subscribe to a particular data stream. This source uses the Kinesis Client Library (KCL) to listen from a specified initial point in the data stream. It returns dynamically sized batches of records, however, the max size can also be configured.
+
* *HTTP > Listener*
+
Initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port
+
* *Scheduler*
+
Initiates a flow when a time-based condition is met

For example, to configure the Amazon Kinesis *Listener* source, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *Kinesis*.
. Drag *Listener* to the Studio canvas.
. On the *Listener* properties window, optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. Click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of the Amazon Kinesis Connector in the app.
. On the *General* tab, complete the following fields:
+
[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Field a|Description
|Name | Name used to reference this connector instance
|Access Key | Access key provided by Amazon
|Secret Key | Secret key provided by Amazon
|Region Endpoint |  URL entry point for a web service
|Role | IAM role, if any
|===
+
. On the *Security* tab, optionally specify the TLS information for the connector.
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.
. In the *Listener Params* section of the *Listener* properties window, optionally enter values for the fields.

[[add-connector-operation]]
== Add a Connector Operation to the Flow

When you add a connector operation to your flow, you immediately define a specific operation for that connector to perform.

You can use the following operations:

* *Checkpoint*, which keeps track of the current position in the Kinesis data stream
* *Seek*, which moves the reading position of the sources (listeners)
+
While moving forward in the stream is fluent, moving backward causes an internal restart of the Kinesis Client Library (KCL) instance. Therefore, use this operation sparingly to move backward in a stream.
+
* *Put Record*, which puts a record into the Kinesis data stream.
+
If the *Aggregation Enabled* field in the global configuration *Advanced* tab is `true` (the default), then multiple records are combined and stored in one Kinesis Data Streams record.
+
Records include binary data, a partition key, and an explicit hash key. The explicit hash key value is normally computed with the MD5 function of the record partition key, but you can override the value by using the *Explicit Hash Key* field. The operation uses the Kinesis Producer Library (KPL), which increases throughput.

To add an operation for Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Connector, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *Kinesis* and then select the desired operation.
. Drag the operation onto the Studio canvas to the right of the source.

[[configure-global-element]]
== Configure a Global Element for the Connector

When you configure a connector, it's best to configure a global element that all instances of that connector in the app can use. Configuring a global element requires you to provide the authentication credentials that the connector requires to access the target Amazon Kinesis Data Streams system.

Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Connector supports Access Key authentication, which uses *Access Key* and *Secret Key* field values for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).

When you configure a global element, you can reference a configuration file that contains ANT-style property placeholders (recommended), or you can enter your authorization credentials in the global configuration properties. For information about the benefits of using property placeholders and how to configure them, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-connector-configuration-overview.adoc[Anypoint Connector Configuration].

To configure a global element, follow these steps:

. Select the name of the connector in the Studio canvas.
. In the configuration screen for the operation, click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to access the global element configuration fields.
. On the *General* tab, configure the following fields.
+
[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|Name | Name used to reference the connector instance
|Access Key | Access key provided by Amazon
|Secret Key | Secret key provided by Amazon
|Region Endpoint | URL entry point for a web service
|Role | IAM role, if any
|===
+
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify proxy and reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

== Next Step

After you configure a global element and connection information, configure the other fields for the connector.

== Connect in Design Center

. Click a trigger. You can create a global element by selecting Reusable Configurations.
If a global element is not needed, you can use an HTTP Listener or Scheduler trigger.

+
. To create an HTTP global element for the connector, set these fields:
+
image::sap-concur-http-listener.png[Http Listener configuration]
+
[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|Protocol | Protocol selected for the HTTP endpoint, it can be HTTP or HTTPS (secure).
|Host| IP address where your Mule application listens for requests.
|Port| Port address where your Mule application listens for requests.
|Base| Path where your Mule application listens for requests.

. Select the connector as a component.
. Select an operation (see the next section for a list of operations).
. Configure the Global element for the connector.
+
image::sap-concur-config-design.png[config connector]
+
[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|Host | Enter the host name of the Concur connector.
|Port | Enter the port on which the Concur connector is running. Default value is 443.
|Base Path | Path where your Mule application listens for requests.
|Protocol |Protocol selected for the http endpoint, it can be http or https (secure).
|Authorization| A Concur access token.
|===
+
. Create an access token for your Concur instance. Specifying `+https://www.concursolutions.com:443/net2/oauth2/accesstoken.ashx+` in Postman using the `GET` method to create an access token is https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/authentication/authorization-pre-2017.html[deprecated]. Instead, use one of the following authentication methods to create an access token:
* https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/authentication/apidoc.html#auth_grant[Authorization grant]
* https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/authentication/apidoc.html#password_grant[Password grant]
* https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/authentication/apidoc.html#client_credentials[Client Credentials grant]
* https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/authentication/apidoc.html#otp_grant[One Time Password grant]
. After obtaining the access token for your Concur instance, use the access token in the configuration for SAP Concur Connector. The following screenshot shows an example of obtaining an access token using the Password grant:

== About Concur API Availability

Review the SAP Concur Connector Reference for the supported API.

== Add the Connector to a Studio Project

Anypoint Studio provides two ways to add the connector to your Studio project: from the Exchange button in the Studio taskbar or from the Mule Palette view.

=== Add the Connector Using Exchange

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. Click the Exchange icon *(X)* in the upper-left of the Studio task bar.
. In Exchange, click *Login* and supply your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. In Exchange, search for "concur".
. Select the connector and click *Add to project*.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

=== Add the Connector in Studio

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. In the Mule Palette view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Modules to Project*, type "concur" in the search field.
. Click this connector's name in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

== Example Use Case

This guide presents two of many use cases you might have for the Concur connector in your organization: getting a list of lists and retrieving quickexpenses. You may jump ahead and paste the code for the flows into the XML Editor in Studio after you download the Concur connector and create a global element to reference your Concur instance credentials.

=== Get List Items

After creating a new project and a Concur global element:

. Add a new flow element by dragging it from the palette and give a name to the flow, such as `getlists`.
. Drag an HTTP Listener into your flow from the palette.
. Double-click the HTTP Listener and click the green plus sign next to the Connector Configuration dropdown and set the Host to localhost, and the Port to 8081.
. Click OK to close the properties window, then enter getlists as the value in the Path field in this HTTP listener's Basic Settings section.
. Add a Concur connector to the new flow, select the connector configuration, and select the *Get list items* operation.
. Finally, add a Transform Message transformer to the flow.
. For reference you may check the particular getlists flow within the example XML code further down.

To execute the flow and check the outcome:

. Right-click the project in the Package Explorer, and click Run As > Mule Application.
. Check that the application has started by monitoring the Studio console.
. Open the browser and go to `+http://localhost:8081/getlists+`.
. You should receive a JSON response like this:
+

    "Items": [
        {
            "ListID": "gWjM8QmJmOqZnW2i9MaJqJgAMhR$sGXQ$seYQ",
            "Name": "American Express Travel",
            "ParentID": null,
            "Level1Code": "American Express Travel",
            "Level2Code": null,

            "Level7Code": null,
            "Level8Code": null,
            "Level9Code": null,
            "Level10Code": null,
            "IsDeleted": false,
            "ID": "gWgUluaspXXNeeNwsbk6mGsqOlp0pxJyRWQ",
            "URI": "https://implementation.concursolutions.com/api/v3.0/common/listitems/gWgUluaspXXNeeNwsbk6mGsqOlp0pxJyRWQ"
        },

. Click the stop button to halt the server running the application.

=== Create a Quick Expense

. Add a new flow element by dragging it from the palette and name it getquickexpenses.
. Add an HTTP Listener to your flow by dragging it from the palette.
. Use the configuration from the first demo, or if you did not create that flow, click the green plus sign next to Connector Configuration for the HTTP endpoint and enter localhost as the Host and 8081 for the Port.
+
. Click OK to close the properties window, then enter getquickexpenses as the value in the Path field in this HTTP listener's Basic Settings section.

. Add the Concur connector to the new flow, referencing a global element from the Connector Configuration and set an Operation to perform and any other properties you require.
. Finally, add an Transform Message transformer link in the previous example.

To execute the flow and check the outcome, perform the following steps:

. Right-click the project in the Package Explorer > Run As > Mule Application
. Check the console to see when the application starts.
. Open the browser and go to `+http://localhost:8081/getquickexpenses+`
. You should receive a JSON response like this:
+

== Default Configuration


=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | |x
| Expiration Policy a| ExpirationPolicy |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform expires the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime actually purges the instances as it sees fit. |  |
| Schema definitions a| Array of String |  List of paths for schemas to be used by module. The paths may be either for file system or classpath. |  |
| Partner Code a| String |  Code used to identify partner. When this value is specified, it is used both to validate the Transmission Sender Code in received transmissions and to set the Transmission Recipient Code in sent transmissions (if not already specified in map data). If not specified, the Transmission Sender Code is not checked in received transmissions. |  |
| Partner Name a| String |  Name used to identify partner. When this value is specified, it is used both to validate the Transmission Sender Name in received transmissions and to set the Transmission Recipient Name in sent transmissions (if not already specified in map data). If not specified, the Transmission Sender Name is not checked in received transmissions. |  |
| Mule Code a| String |  Code used to identify Mule application. When this value is specified, it is used both to validate the Transmission Recipient Code in received transmissions and to set the Transmission Sender Code in sent transmissions (if not already specified in map data). If not specified, the Transmission Recipient Code is not checked in received transmissions. |  |
| Mule Name a| String |  Name used to identify self. When this value is specified, it is used both to validate the Transmission Recipient Name in received transmissions and to set the Transmission Sender Name in sent transmissions (if not already specified in map data). If not specified, the Transmission Recipient Name is not checked in received transmissions. |  |
| Enforce length limits a| Boolean |  Enforce minimum and maximum lengths for receive values. If true, a transmission with values too long or too short is rejected; if false, the values are used anyway and the transmission is not rejected. In either case the error is logged and included in the error list. |  true |
| Allow unknown segments a| Boolean |  Allow unknown segments in a message. If false, a transmission containing any unknown segments is rejected; if true, unknown segments are ignored and the transmission is not rejected. In either case the error is logged and included in the error list. |  false |
| Allow unused segments a| Boolean |  Allow segments marked as 'Unused' in a message. If false, a message containing segments marked as unused in the schema is rejected; if true, the message is not rejected and the unused segments are ignored. In either case the error is reported in CONTRL functional acknowledgments. |  true |
| Enforce segment order a| Boolean |  Enforce segment order in a message. If true, a message with segments out of order is rejected; if false and the segment can be reordered the message is not rejected. In either case the error is reported in CONTRL functional acknowledgments. |  true |
| Transmission Reference a| String |  Default Sender's Transmission Reference used when writing a transmission. If specified, this value is used as a default if the required Sender's Transmission Reference value is not specified in map data for a send transmission (write operation). |  |
| Recipient Reference a| String |  Default Recipient's Transmission Reference used when writing a transmission. If specified, this value is used as a default if an optional Recipient's Transmission Reference value is not specified in map data for a send transmission (write operation). |  |
| Application Reference a| String |  Default Application Reference used when writing a transmission. If specified, this value is used as a default if an optional Application Reference value is not specified in map data for a send transmission (write operation). |  |
| Priority Code a| String |  Default Transmission Priority Code used when writing a transmission. If specified, this value is used as a default if an optional Transmission Priority Code value is not specified in map data for a send transmission (write operation). |  |

`<tradacoms:write>`

Transform maps/lists structure of EDI data to EDI text stream.

=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Configuration | String | The name of the configuration to use. | |x
| Write Content a| Object |  |  `#[payload]` |
| Streaming Strategy a| * repeatable-in-memory-stream
* repeatable-file-store-stream
* non-repeatable-stream |  Configure if repeatable streams should be used and their behavior. |  |
| Target Variable a| String |  The name of a variable on which the operation's output is placed. |  |
| Target Value a| String |  An expression to evaluate against the operation's output and the outcome of that expression is stored in the target variable. |  `#[payload]` |
|===

=== Output

[cols=".^50%,.^50%"]
|===
| Type | Binary
|===

=== For Configurations

* config

=== Throws

* TRADACOMS:UNKNOWN
* TRADACOMS:SCHEMA
* TRADACOMS:PARSE
* TRADACOMS:WRITE


== Types

[[ExpirationPolicy]]
=== Expiration Policy

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Idle Time a| Number | A scalar time value for the maximum amount of time a dynamic configuration instance should be allowed to be idle before it's considered eligible for expiration |  |
| Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS | A time unit that qualifies the maxIdleTime attribute |  |
|===

[[repeatable-in-memory-stream]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Stream

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | Amount of memory to allocate to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can fit into this buffer, then the buffer expands according to the bufferSizeIncrement attribute, with an upper limit of maxInMemorySize. |  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | How much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer should not expand, meaning that a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error will be raised when the buffer gets full. |  |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | This is the maximum amount of memory that will be used. If more than that is used then a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error will be raised. A value lower or equal to zero means no limit. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which all these attributes are expressed. |  |
|===

[[repeatable-file-store-stream]]
=== Repeatable File Store Stream

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max In Memory Size a| Number | Defines the maximum memory that the stream should use to keep data in memory. If more than that is consumed then it starts to buffer the content on disk. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which maxInMemorySize is expressed |  |

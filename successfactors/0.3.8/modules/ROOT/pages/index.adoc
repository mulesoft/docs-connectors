== Using the Connector

For details on operations see the https://mulesoft.github.io/mule3-sap-successfactors-connector/[SuccessFactors connector technical reference] and click the APIdoc for your connector version.


=== Using the Connector in a Mavenized Mule App

If you are coding a Mavenized Mule application, this XML snippet must be included in your `pom.xml` file.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId></groupId>
  <artifactId></artifactId>
  <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>
----

Replace `x.y.z` with the version that corresponds to the connector you are using.

To obtain the most up-to-date `pom.xml` file information, access the connector in https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Anypoint Exchange] and click *Dependency Snippets*.

== SuccessFactor Connector Use Cases and Demos

The SuccessFactors Connector is an operation-based connector that allows you to invoke web service operations exposed by the *SFAPI* API.

This section of the manual provides a brief description of simple use case scenarios for this connector:

* <<List Entities Use Case>>
* <<Describe Entity Use Case>>
* <<Query Use Case>>
* <<Upsert Use Case>>
* <<Update Use Case>>
* <<Insert Use Case>>
* <<Delete Use Case>>

All of the example use cases are stored in one Mule application. See <<Flow XML for Use Cases>>.

=== List Entities Use Case

This flow retrieves the list of entities in your organization.

image::list-flow.png[list_flow]

The connector itself does not require any additional configuration, apart from the operation to select:

image::list-flow-connector-config.png[list_flow_connector_config]

To test it, run the flow in Studio and open a browser window. Visit `http://localhost:8081/` and click the List*button under the List Entities section to see the list of entities available.

=== Describe Entity Use Case

This flow retrieves all the available metadata from an entity in your organization. +

image::describe-flow.png[describe_flow]

The *Describe entities* operation only needs a list of strings corresponding to the entities you wish to retrieve the metadata for. In this example, this input is configured to take the payload sent to it by the preceding endpoint.

image::describe-flow-connector-config.png[describe_flow_connector_config]

In order to design the input for the connector, we use the *Dataweave* language made available through the *Transform Message* component. Its output is a list containing just one element, which is the query parameter 'entity' from the HTTP Connector.

Add the below DataWeave code to the DataWeave editor inside the Transform Message component.

[source,text,linenums]
----
%dw 1.0
%output application/java
---
[inboundProperties."http.query.params".'entity']
----

Run the flow in Studio to test this and open a browser window. Visit `http://localhost:8081/`. Click on *List* under *List Entities*, then click on an entity name. Finally, click the *Describe* button under the *Describe Entities* section to see all the available metadata for the entity selected.

=== Query Use Case

This flow runs a query on Success Factors and shows the response. +

image::query-flow.png[query_flow]

The *Query* operation needs a query and a page size.

You can either enter the native (SFQL) query language, or build it with the DataSense Query Builder.

image::query-flow-query-builder.png[query_flow_query_builder]

You can leave the page size at the default value.

image::query-flow-connector-config.png[query_flow_connector_config]

To test this flow, run the flow in Mule Studio and open a browser window. Visit `+http://localhost:8081/query+`.
You see the result of the query in the browser.


=== Upsert Use Case

This flow does the following:

* Inserts a new User (or updates it, if it already exists).
* Returns the output of the upsert.

image::upsert-flow.png[upsert_flow]

The SuccessFactors endpoint needs to be configured with the *Upsert* operation. First, select the type of the entity you wish to upsert, which in this example is a User. If the *Type* dropdown is not populated, click the refresh button on the right.
The input structure is taken from the payload returned by DataWeave.

image::upsert-flow-connector-config.png[upsert_flow_connector_config]

DataWeave turns the JSON object taken from the payload of the HTTP endpoint and converts it to a map, which is the input needed for the Upsert operation.

To test this flow, run the flow in Mule Studio and open a browser window. Enter `+http://localhost:8081/+` and click the *Submit* button under the *Upsert User* section to see the result of the upsert operation in the browser.

=== Update Use Case

This flow does the following:

* Updates a User with a new username.
* Returns the output of the last update.

image::update-flow.png[update_flow]

The SuccessFactors endpoint needs to be configured with the *Update* operation. First, select the type of the entity you wish to update, which in this case is a User. If the *Type* dropdown is not populated, click the refresh button on the right.
The input structure will be taken from the payload returned by DataWeave.

DataWeave turns the JSON object taken from the payload of the HTTP endpoint and converts it to a map, which is the input needed for the Update operation.

To test this flow, run the flow in Mule Studio and open a browser window. Visit `+http://localhost:8081/+` and click the *Submit* button under the *Update User* section to see the result of the update operation in the browser. If you have already run the *Upsert* demo, the input for the Update job should have already been populated.

==== Insert Use Case

This flow inserts a new Goal$1 entity and returns the output of the insertion.

image::insert-flow.png[insert_flow]

The SuccessFactors endpoint needs to be configured with the *Insert* operation. Select the type of the entity you wish to insert, which in this case is Goal$1. If the *Type* dropdown is not populated, click the refresh button on the right.
The input structure will be taken from the payload returned by DataWeave.

image::sfc-insert-flow-connector-config.png[insert flow connector config]

DataWeave turns the JSON object taken from the payload of the HTTP endpoint and converts it to a map, which is the input needed for the Insert operation.

To test this flow, run the flow in Mule Studio and open a browser window. Visit `+http://localhost:8081/+` and click the Submit button under the Insert Goals section to see the result of the insert operation in the browser.

==== Delete Use Case

This flow deletes an existing Goal entity and returns the output of the deletion.

image::delete-flow.png[delete_flow]

The SuccessFactors endpoint needs to be configured with the Delete operation. Select the type of the entity you wish to delete. If the Type dropdown is not populated, click the refresh button on the right.
The input structure is taken from the payload returned by DataWeave.

image::delete-flow-connector-config.png[delete_flow_connector_config]

DataWeave turns the JSON object taken from the payload of the HTTP endpoint and converts it to a map, which is the input needed for the Delete operation:

image::dataweave-payload.png[dataweave_payload]

To test this flow, run the flow in Mule Studio and open a browser window. Visit `+http://localhost:8081/+` and click the Submit button under the Delete Goal section to see the result of the delete operation in the browser. If you have already run the Insert demo, the input for the Delete job should have already been populated.

Twilio is a cloud communications Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

MuleSoft maintains this connector under the xref:3.8@mule-runtime::anypoint-connectors.adoc#connector-support-categories[_Select_] support policy.

== About the Twilio Connector

The Twilio platform serves APIs for text messaging, VoIP, and voice calls. The Anypoint Connector for Twilio provides connectivity to the Twilio text messaging API.

This connector provides an API for sending and receiving text messages. To get started with Twilio, follow the steps below to gain access to the free Twilio sandbox service to send SMS text messages. You can configure the Twilio connector in Anypoint Studio with your API credentials.

*Note:* To use the Twilio connector, you must have an active Twilio.com account, either as a Trial or Paid. To create an
account, see https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio[Try Twilio].

The Anypoint Connector for *Twilio* provides connectivity to the Twilio platform, which serves APIs for text messaging, VoIP, and voice calls.

You can use this document to understand how to set up and configure a basic flow using the connector. You can track feature additions, compatibility, limitations, and API version updates with each release of the connector using the xref:release-notes::connector/twilio-connector-release-notes.adoc[Connector Release Notes]. Review the connector operations and functionality using the http://mulesoft.github.io/mule3-twilio-connector/[Technical Reference] with the https://www.anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/?search=twilio[demo applications].

=== About Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule,
xref:3.8@mule-runtime::anypoint-connectors.adoc[Anypoint Connectors], and
xref:6@studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio]. To increase your familiarity with Studio, consider completing a xref:6@studio::basic-studio-tutorial.adoc[Anypoint Studio Tutorial]. This page requires some basic knowledge of xref:3.8@mule-runtime::mule-concepts.adoc[Mule Concepts], xref:3.8@mule-runtime::elements-in-a-mule-flow.adoc[Elements in a Mule Flow], and xref:3.8@mule-runtime::global-elements.adoc[Global Elements].

=== About Hardware and Software Requirements

For hardware and software requirements, visit the xref:3.8@mule-runtime::hardware-and-software-requirements.adoc[Hardware and Software Requirements] page.

== To Create a New Twilio Account

To create a new Twilio account:

. Browse to https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio[Try Twilio].
. After you log in to your developer account, you see the Twilio dashboard. Note the *Account SID* and *Auth Token* values, and copy the credentials to the Twilio connector configuration menu in Anypoint Studio.
+
With a free developer account, you need to verify your SMS-enabled phone before you can send text messages to it.
+
. Click *Numbers* in the Twilio website navigation to go to the Manage Numbers portion of their website.
. Click *Verify Numbers*, and then click *Verify a number*.
. Enter your cell phone number, and click *Call this number*. Follow the instructions provided to validate your number. You receive an automated phone call and need to enter an authorization code.
. Finally, to send SMS-messages, you  need to use the Sandbox `from` number. This phone number needs to be entered into the Twilio connector configuration menu in Anypoint Studio. This Sandbox number is also located on the Twilio dashboard, with the Account SID and Auth Token.

*Tip:* As you copy fields from the Twilio website to the Anypoint Studio connector configuration, be sure to not copy in additional leading/trailing characters or spaces. It is a good idea to visually confirm that your copy and paste functions did not capture surrounding characters.

== To Install this Connector

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio taskbar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange.
. Search for the connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

When Studio has an update, a message displays in the lower right corner, which you can click to install the update.

== To Configure Global Properties in Studio

=== About the Connector's Namespace and Schema

When designing your application in Studio, the act of dragging the connector from the palette onto the Anypoint Studio canvas automatically populates the XML code with the connector *namespace* and *schema location*.

* *Namespace:* `http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/twilio`
* *Schema Location:* `http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/connector/current/mule-twilio.xsd`

[TIP]
If you are manually coding the Mule application in Studio's XML editor or other text editor, define the namespace and schema location in the header of your *Configuration XML*, inside the `<mule>` tag.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<mule xmlns="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xmlns:twilio="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/twilio"
      xsi:schemaLocation="
               http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core
               http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core/current/mule.xsd
               http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/twilio

      <!-- put your global configuration elements and flows here -->

=== Maven Dependency Information

If Maven is backing the application, this XML snippet must be included in your `pom.xml` file.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.mule.modules</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-module-twilio</artifactId>
  <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>
----

Replace `x.y.z` with the version that corresponds to the connector you are using.

To obtain the most up-to-date `pom.xml` file information, access the connector in https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Anypoint Exchange] and click *Dependency Snippets*.


== To Configure Use Cases

The following are common use cases for the Twilio connector:

* <<Send and Redact Message>>
* http://mulesoft.github.io/mule3-twilio-connector/[Get, Send, Redact, and Delete messages]


[use-case-1]
== To Configure Send and Redact Messages

In the following example, a Mule application sends a message to a phone number, and then redacts it.

image::twilio-use-case-flow.png[]

. Create a new Mule application and add the following properties to the `mule-app.properties` file:
+
[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|Property |Description
|`accountSid` |Your Account SID.
|`authToken` |Your Authentication Token.
|`fromNumber` |The phone number from where SMS is to be sent. This is configured inside the Twilio instance.
|===
+
. Add an empty flow and drag an *HTTP* endpoint to the inbound part of the flow. Set its path to `/send/{toNumber}`.
. Drag a *Transform Message* at the flow and prepare the input for the Twilio connector:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
%dw 1.0
%output application/java
---
{
    body: "You are now subscribed!",
    from: "${fromNumber}",
    to: "+" ++ inboundProperties.'http.uri.params'.toNumber
} as :object {
    class : "org.mule.modules.twilio.pojo.sendmessagerequest.MessageInput"
}
----
+
. Add a *Twilio Connector* after the *Transform Message* and apply the following settings:
** Select the *Send Message* operation.
** Set *Account Sid* to `${accountSid}`, and *Entity Reference* to `#[payload]`.
+
. Drag a *Variable* component and configure the following parameters:
** Set *Name* to `messageSid`.
** Set *Value* to `#[payload.getSid()]`.
+
. Add another *Transform Message* to create the input for the *Redact Message* operation:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
%dw 1.0
%output application/java
---
{
    body: "",
    from: payload.from,
    to: payload.'to'
} as :object {
    class : "org.mule.modules.twilio.pojo.redactmessagerequest.MessageInput"
}
----
+
. Drag a *Twilio Connector* after the *Transform Message* and apply the following settings:
** Select the *Redact Message* operation.
** Set *Account Sid* to `${accountSid}`.
** Set *Message Sid* to `\#[messageSid]` (this is the variable we stored two steps above).
** Set *Entity Reference* to `#[payload]`.
+
. Put an *Object to JSON* transformer at the end of the flow.
. Run the application and point your browser to *http://localhost:8081/send/{toNumber}*, replacing the `toNumber` with a valid mobile phone number.

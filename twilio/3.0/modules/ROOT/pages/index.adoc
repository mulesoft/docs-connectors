Twilio Connector v3.0

Anypoint Connector for Twilio (Twilio Connector) is a cloud communications infrastructure as a service (IaaS).

The Twilio platform serves APIs for text messaging, VoIP, and voice calls. Twilio Connector provides connectivity to the Twilio text messaging API.

This connector provides an API for sending and receiving text messages. To get started with Twilio, follow the steps below to gain access to their free sandbox service to send SMS text messages. You can configure the Twilio connector in Anypoint Studio with your API credentials.

== Before You Begin

To use this information, you should be familiar with Twilio, Mule runtime engine (Mule), Anypoint Connectors, Anypoint Studio, Mule concepts, elements in a Mule flow, and Global Elements.

You need login credentials to test your connection to your target resource.

For software requirements and compatibility information, see the Connector Release Notes.

To use the Twilio connector, you must have an active Twilio.com account, either as a Trial or Paid. To create a Twilio account, browse to the Try Twilio web site at the `+https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio+` URL.

== Add a POM File Dependency

The Apache Maven `pom.xml` file generated by Anypoint Studio contains dependencies for a Mule app. If you code a Mule app manually, include this XML snippet in your `pom.xml` file to enable access to this connector:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.mulesoft.connectors</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-twilio-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
</dependency>
----

Replace `x.x.x` with the version that corresponds to the connector you are using.

To obtain the most up-to-date `pom.xml` file information:

. Go to https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Anypoint Exchange].
. In Exchange, click *Login* and supply your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. In Exchange, search for `twilio`.
. Select the connector.
. Click *Dependency Snippets* near the upper right of the screen.

== Create a New Twilio Account

. Browse to the Try Twilio web site at the `+https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio+` URL.
. Sign up and click Get Started.
+
With a free developer account, you need to verify your SMS-enabled phone before you can send text messages to it.
+
. When prompted, enter your cell phone number. Follow the instructions provided to validate your number. You receive an automated text message and an authorization code.
. After you enter the authorization code, Twilio takes you to the main screen.
. Note the Account SID and Auth Token values, and copy the credentials for later use in the Twilio connector configuration menu in Anypoint Studio.
+
Tip: As you copy fields from the Twilio website to the Anypoint Studio connector configuration, be sure to not copy in additional leading and trailing characters or spaces. It is a good idea to visually confirm that your copy and paste functions did not capture surrounding characters.
+
. Click Phone Numbers > Manage Numbers
. Click Get Started.
. Click Get Your First Twilio Phone Number. Twilio lists the number for you. Copy this number for later use.

== Connect in Design Center

. In Design Center, click Create and choose Mule Application.
. Click a trigger such as an HTTP Listener or the Scheduler trigger.
+

== Add the Connector to a Studio Project

Anypoint Studio provides two ways to add the connector to your Studio project: from the Exchange button in the Studio taskbar or from the Mule Palette view.

=== Add the Connector Using Exchange

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. Click the Exchange icon *(X)* in the upper-left of the Studio task bar.
. In Exchange, click *Login* and supply your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. In Exchange, search for "twilio".
. Select the connector and click *Add to project*.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

=== Add the Connector in Studio

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. In the Mule Palette view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Modules to Project*, type "twilio" in the search field.
. Click this connector's name in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

=== Configure in Studio

. Drag the connector to the Studio Canvas.
. Configure the global element for the connector.
+
[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
| Field | Description
| Protocol | Protocol selected for the HTTP connector, it can be HTTP or HTTPS (secure).
| Host | IP address where your Mule application listens for requests.
| Port | Port address where your Mule application listens for requests.

For more information about each format, see the See Also section at the end of this document.

== Example

In this example, a Mule app sends a message to a phone number and then redacts it. The example uses variables in place of the Twilio credentials and the phone number from which the SMS is sent.

=== Preliminary steps

Follow these steps to use property placeholders for field values:

. Create a new Mule project in Studio.
. Add the following properties to a YAML or XML file:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
config.accountSid=<Your account SID>
config.authToken=<Your authentication token>
config.fromNumber=<The phone number from which the SMS is sent, as configured inside the Twilio instance>
----
+
. Place the file in the projectâ€™s `src/main/resources` folder.
. Reference this file in the connector configuration, as described in xref:connectors::introduction/intro-connector-configuration-overview.adoc#property-placeholders[Use Property Placeholders for Property Values].

=== Configure the Mule App

Follow these steps to configure the Mule app for this example:

. Drag the *HTTP Listener* operation to the Studio canvas and set its path to `/send/{toNumber}`.
. Drag a *Transform Message* component to the right of *Listener* and use DataWeave to prepare the input for the Twilio connector:
+
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/java
---
{
    Body: "You are now subscribed!",
    From: p('fromNumber'),
    To: "+" ++ attributes.uriParams.toNumber as String default "my default value"
}
----
+
. Drag the Twilio *Send Message* operation to the right of the *Transform Message* component and set the *Account Sid* field to `${accountSid}`.
. Drag a *Set Variable* component to the right of the *Transform Message* component and configure the following fields:
** Set the *Name* field to `messageSid`.
** Set the *Value* field to `#[payload.sid].
+
. Drag a *Transform Message* component to the right of *Set Variable* to create the input for the *Redact Message* operation:
+
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/java
---
{
    Body: "",
    From: payload.from,
    To: payload.'to'
}
----
+
. Drag a Twilio *Redact Message* operation to the right of the *Transform Message* component and configure the following fields:
** Set the *Account Sid* field to `${accountSid}`.
** Set the *Message Sid* field to `#[messageSid]`, which is the variable stored in step 5.
+
. Drag a *Transform Message* component to the right of *Redact Message* and set the output to `application/json`:
+
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/json
---
payload
----
+
. Run the application and point your browser to `+http://localhost:8081/send/{toNumber}+`, replacing the `toNumber` with the phone number obtained from Twilio.

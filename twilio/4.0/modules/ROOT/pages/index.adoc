= Twilio Connector 4.0 - Mule 4

Support Category: https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#anypoint-connectors[Select]

Twilio is a cloud-based service that enables powerful communication between mobile devices, applications, services, and systems throughout the business to bridge the gap between conventional communication.

Anypoint Connector for Twilio (Twilio Connector) provides an interface to the Twilio REST API, which enables you to create connectivity between Twilio and third party SaaS applications, CRM solutions, and more.

For compatibility information and fixed issues, see the Twilio Connector Release Notes.

== Before You Begin

To use this connector, you must be familiar with:

* The Twilio Messaging API
* Anypoint Connectors
* Mule runtime engine (Mule)
* Elements and global elements in a Mule flow
* Creating a Mule app using Anypoint Studio (Studio)

Before creating an app, you must have:

* An active Twilio trial or paid account
* Credentials to access the Twilio target resource

== Create a New Twilio Account

To create a new Twilio account, browse to the https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio[Try Twilio] website and follow the directions.

Copy the Account SID and Auth Token values to use with the Twilio Connector configuration. As you copy these values from the Twilio website to the Anypoint Studio connector configuration, ensure that you don't copy in additional leading and trailing characters or spaces. Doing so will cause authentication to the Twilio SMS API to fail.

== Next Step

After you complete the prerequisites, you are ready to create your own app and configure the connector using xref:twilio-connector-studio.adoc[Anypoint Studio].

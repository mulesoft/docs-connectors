= Salesforce CDP Connector 1.0 - Mule 4

Support Category: https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#anypoint-connectors[Select]

Anypoint Connector for Salesforce CDP (Salesforce CDP Connector) provides customers a pipeline to send data from both non-Salesforce and Salesforce properties alike into Salesforce CDP.

This connector works with the Salesforce CDP Bulk and Streaming API, depending on the operation you configure. Each API call uses a request/response pattern over an HTTPS connection. All required request headers, error handling, and HTTPS connection configurations are built into the connector.

Ignore the results of the connectivity test. |  |
| Reconnection Strategy a| * <<Reconnect>>

[[Reconnect]]
=== Reconnect

Configures a standard reconnection strategy, which specifies how often to reconnect and how many reconnection attempts the connector source or operation can make.

|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Frequency a| Number | How often to attempt to reconnect, in milliseconds. |  |

[[RepeatableInMemoryStream]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Stream

Configures the in-memory streaming strategy by which the request fails if the data exceeds the buffer size. Always run performance tests to find the optimal buffer size for your specific use case.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | The amount of memory that will be allocated to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can be fit into this buffer, then the buffer expands according to the bufferSizeIncrement attribute, with an upper limit of maxInMemorySize. |  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | Amount by which the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of `0` or lower specifies that the buffer can't expand. |  |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | The maximum amount of memory to use. If more than that is used then a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised. A value lower than or equal to zero means no limit. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | Unit for the *Initial Buffer Size*, *Buffer Size Increment*, and *Buffer Unit* fields. |  |
|===

[[RepeatableFileStoreStream]]
=== Repeatable File Store Stream

Configures the repeatable file-store streaming strategy by which Mule keeps a portion of the stream content in memory. If the stream content is larger than the configured buffer size, Mule backs up the buffer’s content to disk and then clears the memory.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| In Memory Size a| Number | Maximum amount of memory that the stream can use for data. If the amount of memory exceeds this value, Mule buffers the content to disk. To optimize performance:

* Configure a larger buffer size to avoid the number of times Mule needs to write the buffer on disk. This increases performance, but it also limits the number of concurrent requests your application can process, because it requires additional memory.

* Configure a smaller buffer size to decrease memory load at the expense of response time. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | Unit for the *In Memory Size* field. |  |

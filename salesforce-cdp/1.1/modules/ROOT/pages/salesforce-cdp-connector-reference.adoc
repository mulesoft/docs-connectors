[[RepeatableInMemoryStream]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Stream

Configures the in-memory streaming strategy by which the request fails if the data exceeds the buffer size. Always run performance tests to find the optimal buffer size for your specific use case.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | The amount of memory that will be allocated to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can be fit into this buffer, then the buffer expands according to the bufferSizeIncrement attribute, with an upper limit of maxInMemorySize. |  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | Amount by which the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of `0` or lower specifies that the buffer can't expand. |  |

|===

[[RepeatableFileStoreStream]]
=== Repeatable File Store Stream

Configures the repeatable file-store streaming strategy by which Mule keeps a portion of the stream content in memory. If the stream content is larger than the configured buffer size, Mule backs up the buffer’s content to disk and then clears the memory.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| In Memory Size a| Number | Maximum amount of memory that the stream can use for data. If the amount of memory exceeds this value, Mule buffers the content to disk. To optimize performance:

* Configure a larger buffer size to avoid the number of times Mule needs to write the buffer on disk. This increases performance, but it also limits the number of concurrent requests your application can process, because it requires additional memory.

* Configure a smaller buffer size to decrease memory load at the expense of response time. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | Unit for the *In Memory Size* field. |  |
|===

[[RedeliveryPolicy]]

| Message Digest Algorithm a| String | Secure hashing algorithm to use if the *Use Secure Hash* field is `true`. If the payload of the message is a Java object, Mule ignores this value and returns the value that the payload’s `hashCode()` returned. |  |
| Message Identifier a| <<RedeliveryPolicyMessageIdentifier>> | Defines which strategy is used to identify the messages. |  |
| Object Store a| ObjectStore | Configures the object store that stores the redelivery counter for each message.  |  |
|===

[[RedeliveryPolicyMessageIdentifier]]
=== Redelivery Policy Message Identifier

Configures how to identify a redelivered message and how to find out when the message was redelivered.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Use Secure Hash a| Boolean | If `true`, Mule uses a secure hash algorithm to identify a redelivered message. |  |
| Id Expression a| String | One or more expressions that determine when a message was redelivered. You can set this property only if the *Use Secure Hash* field is `false`. |  |

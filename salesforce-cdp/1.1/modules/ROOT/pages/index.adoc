= Salesforce CDP Connector 1.1 - Mule 4

Support Category: https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#anypoint-connectors[Select]

Anypoint Connector for Salesforce CDP (Salesforce CDP Connector) provides Mule users with a quick and easy way to integrate with Salesforce CDP API endpoints. Users can automate data ingestion from third parties, query the CDP Data Lake, search and query customer profile information and calculated insights, and consume data action events to enrich the 360-degree view of their customers in their CDP instance.

Each API call uses a request/response pattern over an HTTPS connection. All required request headers, error handling, and HTTPS connection configurations are built into the connector.

For information about compatibility and fixed issues, refer to the Salesforce CDP Connector release notes.

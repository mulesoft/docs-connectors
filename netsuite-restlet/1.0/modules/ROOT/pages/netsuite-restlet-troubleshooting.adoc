= Troubleshooting NetSuite Restlet Connector - Mule 4

You might encounter the following issues when working with the Anypoint Connector for NetSuite Restlet (NetSuite Restlet Connector):

* <<connectivity-test-failure, Connectivity test failure during application startup.>>
* <<permissions-error, The connector returns a permissions error when fetching metadata.>>

[[connectivity-test-failure]]
== Connectivity Test Failure During Application Startup

If a connectivity test fails during application startup and you see the following statement in the stack trace, configure a reconnection strategy for the connector:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
Caused by: java.lang.InterruptedException
	at java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.doAcquireSharedInterruptibly(AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.java:998) ~[?:1.8.0_221]
----

To configure a reconnection strategy for the connector in Anypoint Studio (Studio), add these lines to the *Configure XML* tab in the connector properties window:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<reconnection failsDeployment="true">
	<reconnect count="2" frequency="5" />
</reconnection>
----

For example, the configuration XML for the connector might look like this after you add the reconnection strategy:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<netsuite-restlet:rest-config name="NetSuite_Config" doc:name="NetSuite Config" doc:id="8a4f73c2-e5e1-4f5d-8978-980069828ff0" >
	<netsuite-restlet:restlet-login-connection email="${netsuite.email}" password="${netsuite.password}" account="${netsuite.account}" roleId="${netsuite.roleId}" applicationId="${netsuite.applicationId}" readTimeout="60000" connectionTimeout="60000">
		<reconnection failsDeployment="true">
			<reconnect count="2" frequency="5" />
		</reconnection>
	</netsuite-restlet:restlet-login-connection>
----

In Studio, you can also use the *Advanced* tab in the connector properties window to configure a reconnection strategy. To do so, complete the following fields:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Value
|Reconnection strategy |`Standard`
|Frequency (ms) |`5`
|Reconnection Attempts |`2`
|===

[[permissions-error]]
== Permissions Error When Fetching Metadata

To avoid receiving a permissions error when fetching metadata, enable the `Control SuiteScript and Workflow Triggers in Web Services Request` option in NetSuite for the role used in the connector configuration.

[[search-entities]]
== Inability to Search for Certain Types of Objects

There is a limitation in NetSuite's SuiteTalk API, that prevents you from searching for certain types of objects, such as Sales Order objects. Because of this limitation, you can't use the NetSuite Connector `Search` operation to locate these objects.

To perform a search for Sales Order objects and other unsupported objects, you can do the following:

* Develop a SuiteScript, deploy it as a RESTlet, and call it from the connector.

== Empty Payload in the Call RESTlet (GET) Operation

Even though the *Call RESTlet (GET)* operation is a GET operation, you must specify a payload for the *Data* field or else the connector throws an error. You can specify an empty payload, such as `{}`, to avoid this error.

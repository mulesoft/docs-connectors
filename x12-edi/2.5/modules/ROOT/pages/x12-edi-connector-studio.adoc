= Use Anypoint Studio to Configure X12 EDI Connector - Mule 4
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

Anypoint Studio (Studio) editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.

To add and configure a connector in Studio:

. <<create-mule-project,Create a Mule project>>.
. <<add-connector-to-project,Add the connector to your Mule project>>.
. <<configure-input-source,Configure an input source for the connector's flow>>.
. <<add-connector-operation,Add a connector operation to the flow>>.
. <<configure-global-element,Configure a global element for the connector>>.
. <<conigure-other-fields,Configure the other connector fields>>.

When you run the connector, you can view the app log to check for problems, as described in <<view-app-log,View the App Log>>.

You must change the default Anypoint configuration to use the X12 EDI connector 2.x.

NOTE: If Anypoint Studio 7.1.0 and later requires more than the standard memory
configuration to use the X12 EDI connector 2.x, then you'll need to change the memory
setting for Studio. Edit the `Anypoint.ini` file in the Anypoint Studio
installation directory and change the two lines starting with `-Xms` and `-Xmx` to:

[source,text,linenums]
----
-Xms4096m
-Xmx4096m
----

Setting the Anypoint Studio memory to 4 GB, which is sufficient
for the most common uses of this connector.

// If you are new to configuring connectors in Studio, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-config-use-studio.adoc[Use Studio to Configure a Connector]. If, after reading this topic, you need additional information about the connector fields, see the xref:x12-edi-connector-reference.adoc[X12 EDI Reference].

[[create-mule-project]]
== Create a Mule Project

In Studio, create a new Mule project in which to add and configure the connector:

. In Studio, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
. Enter a name for your Mule project and click *Finish*.

[[add-connector-to-project]]
== Add the Connector to Your Mule Project

Add X12 EDI Connector to your Mule project to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location and add the required dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Modules to Project*, type `X12 EDI:Configuration` in the search field.
. Click X12 EDI:Configuration in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.

[[configure-input-source]]
== Configure a Source

A source initiates a flow when a specified condition is met.
You can configure one of these sources to use with X12 EDI Connector:

* HTTP Listener +
Initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port.

For example, to configure an HTTP Listener source, follow these steps:


. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *HTTP > Listener*.
. Drag *Listener* to the Studio canvas.
. On the *Listener* configuration screen, optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. Specify a value for the *Path* field.
. Click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of the HTTP Listener source in the app.
. On the *General* tab, specify connection information for the connector.
. On the *TLS* tab, optionally specify the TLS information for the connector.
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

[[add-connector-operation]]
== Add a Connector Operation to the Flow

When you add a connector operation to your flow, you are specifying an action for that connector to perform.

To add an operation for X12 EDI Connector, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *X12 EDI:Configuration* and then select the desired operation.
. Drag the operation onto the Studio canvas to the right of the input source.

[[configure-global-element]]
== Configure a Global Element for the Connector

When you configure a connector, configure a global element that all instances of that connector in the app can use.
Configuring a global element requires you to provide the authentication credentials that the connector requires to access the target X12 EDI system.
X12 EDI Connector supports <mention the types of authorization the connector supports>.

To configure the global element for X12 EDI Connector, follow these steps:

. Select the name of the connector in the Studio canvas.
. In the configuration screen for the operation, click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to access the global element configuration fields.
. On the *General* tab, configure <authentication method 1, authentication method 2, etc.>, as described in the <<authentication method 1 and authentication 2>> > sections.
////
The wording of step 3 depends on how many authentication methods the connector uses. If the connector uses only one authentication method, mention it in step 3 and then explain how to configure it in this procedure. If the connector uses multiple authentication methods, mention them in step 3 and then refer to subsections that explain how to configure the authentication methods.
////

You can reference a configuration file that contains ANT-style property placeholders (recommended), or you can enter your authorization credentials in the global configuration properties.
 For information about the benefits of using property placeholders and how to configure them, see xref:introduction/intro-connector-configuration-overview.adoc[Anypoint Connector Configuration].

. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

////
Example of wording for Basic authentication. This varies by connector.

[[basic_authentication]]

////

[[configure-other-fields]]
== Configure Additional Connector Fields

After you configure a global element for <connector name>, configure the the other required fields for the connector:



Use a table like this one to describe the required fields for the connector configuration.
For some connectors, you might also want to list important, nonrequired fields.

[%header,cols=30s,70a]
|===
|Field |Description
|Table name | Name of the table to create
|Attribute definitions | Attributes that describe the key schema for the table and its indexes
|Key schemas | Attributes compose the primary key for a table or index
|===



=== General Tab

image::x12-edi-general.jpg[General tab properties]

The general tab enables you to configure settings for reading and writing X12 messages:

* X12 form and validation (standard X12, HIPAA SNIP Type 1, or HIPAA SNIP Type 2).
* Manually create or edit the list of schema definitions for the message structures to use. They must all use the same form (either X12 or HIPAA).

**Note:** To use the Functional Acknowledgment schema type (997 or 999) it must match the **Generate 999 Functional Acknowledgments** setting on the Parser tab (`false` for 997, `true` for 999).

* X12 character encoding, used for both send and receive messages.
* X12 character set allowed in string data (BASIC, EXTENDED, or UNRESTRICTED).
* String substitution character, used to replace invalid characters in string data.
* Version identifier code suffix, specifying a value appended to the base schema version in the GS08 Version / Release / Industry Identifier Code field.

=== Identity Tab

image::x12-edi-identity.jpg[Identity tab properties]

The Identity tab lets you configure the Interchange Control Header (ISA) and Functional Group Header (GS) identifier values for you and your trading partner in the X12 EDI connector configuration. All these values are optional. If any are configured, the values are verified when reading an input message and used as the defaults when writing an output message if no value is specified in the output data.

The values that can be set are the Interchange ID qualifier and Interchange ID for your Mule application and partner, and the Application Code for Mule and partner. The Mule values specify the Receiver fields (ISA07/ISA08, GS03) in a receive message, and populate the Sender fields (ISA05/ISA06, GS02) fields in a send message.

=== Parser Tab

image::x12-edi-parser.jpg[Parser tab properties]

You can set the following options to control parser validation of receive messages if needed:

* Enforce minimum and maximum lengths for receive values.
* Enforce allowed character set.
* Enforce repetition count limits for receive values.
* Allow unknown segments in a transaction set.
* Enforce segment order in a transaction set.
* Allow segments marked as Unused in a transaction set.
* Enforce segment repetition count limits in a transaction set.
* Enforce conditional rules for receive values.

Note that changing these options from their default setting of true interferes with HIPAA SNIP Type 1 and Type 2 validation of messages. Only use these options with standard X12 data, not with HIPAA.

Other parser options let you:

* Require unique ISA Interchange Control Numbers (ISA13).
* Enforce globally unique Group Control Numbers (GS06) for received functional groups.
* Enforce globally unique Transaction Set Control Numbers (ST02) for received transaction sets.
* Set the minimum number of days to store interchange, group, and transaction set numbers for checking uniqueness.
* Include a separate AK2/AK5 (997) or AK2/IK5 (999) acknowledgment for every received transaction set (rather than using implicit acknowledgments for transaction sets without errors).
* Generate 999 Implementation Acknowledgments, rather than the 997 Functional Acknowledgments generated by default. Note that the support for 999 Implementation Acknowledgments does not include CTX segment generation.
* Report segment error details to sender in the generated 997 or 999 acknowledgments.
* Automatically include a standard 997 or 999 schema that matches the generated acknowledgment in the configuration for received messages.
* Set the path to a Functional Acknowledgment schema to be used for generated acknowledgments such as `/hipaa/005010X231A1/999.esl`, which uses the standard HIPAA 005010X231A1 acknowledgment. +
 The schema type included in the path must match the Generate 999 Functional Acknowledgments setting (`false` for 997, `true` for 999).
 If you do not set the path, the parser uses a hardcoded X12 997 or 999 schema, as appropriate.

=== Writer Tab

 image::x12-edi-writer.jpg[Writer tab properties]

 Writer options let you specify the separator characters used when writing messages.

 [%header,cols=30s,70a]
 |===
 |Field |Description
 |Writer Tab | Name of the table to create
 |Data element separator | Specify characters when writing messages.
 |Component element separator | Specify characters when writing messages.
 |Repetition separator | Specify characters when writing messages.
 |Segment terminator | Specify characters when writing messages.
 |Segment line ending | Line ending written between segments, used to make the output more readable.
 |Unique group numbers | Whether to generate unique GS group control numbers across interchanges.
 |Unique transaction numbers | Whether to generate unique ST transaction set control numbers across groups and interchanges.
 |Implementation reference | An implementation convention reference (ST03) value.
 |Initial interchange number | The starting interchange control number (used only when no current value is found in the object store).
 |Initial group number | The starting group control number (used only when no current value is found in the object store).
 |Initial transaction number | The starting transaction set control number (used only when no current value is found in the object store).
 |Request acknowledgments | Whether to request interchange acknowledgments (ISA14).
 |Default usage indicator | The default interchange usage indicator (ISA15), used when no value is present in the message data.
 |Use supplied values | Whether to use supplied values for control segment information (control numbers, in particular). The default behavior is to always generate control numbers when writing, this allows you to instead use values you have chosen.
 |Output mime type | Whether to use the default output MIME type `application/plain`, or the X12-specific alternative `application/edi-x12`.
 |Enforce length limits | Whether to enforce length limits on input data,
 |Enforce conditional rules | Whether to enforce conditional rules on input data. The default is to ignore conditional rules.
 |Interchange number key | The key-value pair of the interchange control key and interchange control number.
 |Group number key | The key-value pair of group control key and group control number.
 |Transaction number key | The key-value pair of the transaction control key and transaction control number.
 |===


[[view-app-log]]
== View the App Log

To check for problems, you can view the app log as follows:

* If you’re running the app from Anypoint Platform, the app log output is visible in the Anypoint Studio console window.
* If you’re running the app using Mule from the command line, the app log output is visible in your OS console.

Unless the log file path is customized in the app’s log file (`log4j2.xml`), you can also view the app log in the default location `MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`. You can configure the location of the log path in the app log file `log4j2.xml`.

== Next Step

After you configure a global element and connection information, configure the other fields for the connector. See xref:x12-edi-connector-config-topics.adoc[Additional Configuration Information] for more configuration steps.

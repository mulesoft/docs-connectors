[[confirmSubscription]]
=== Confirm Subscription
`<sns:confirm-subscription>`

The confirmSubscription action verifies an endpoint owner's intent to receive messages by validating the token sent to the endpoint by an earlier Subscribe action. If the token is valid, the action creates a new subscription and returns its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This call requires an AWS signature only when the AuthenticateOnUnsubscribe flag is set to `true`. See the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_ConfirmSubscription.html[Amazon SNS API Reference].

| Topic Arn a| String |  The ARN of the topic for which you wish to confirm a subscription. |  | x
| Token a| String |  Short-lived token sent to an endpoint during the `Subscribe` action. |  | x
| Authenticate On Unsubscribe a| String |  Disallows unauthenticated unsubscribes of the subscription. If the value of this parameter is `true` and the request has an AWS signature, then only the topic owner and the subscription owner can unsubscribe the endpoint. The unsubscribe action requires AWS authentication. |  |
| Target Variable a| String |  The name of a variable to store the operation's output. |  |
| Target Value a| String |  An expression to evaluate against the operation's output and store the expression outcome in the target variable. |  `#[payload]` |

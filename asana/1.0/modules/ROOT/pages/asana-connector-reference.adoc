Creates a new portfolio in the given workspace with the supplied name. Note that portfolios created in the Asana UI may have some state (like the 'Priority' custom field) which is automatically added to the portfolio when it is created. Portfolios created via our API will *not* be created with the same initial state to allow integrations to create their own starting state on a portfolio. This operation makes an HTTP POST request to the /portfolios endpoint.

[[CreateWebhooks]]
== Create Webhook
`<asana:create-webhooks>`


Establishing a webhook is a two-part process. First, a simple HTTP POST request initiates the creation similar to creating any other resource. Next, in the middle of this request comes the confirmation handshake.

When a webhook is created, we will send a test POST to the target with an `X-Hook-Secret` header. The target must respond with a `'200'OK` or `'204'No Content` and a matching `X-Hook-Secret` header to confirm that this webhook subscription is indeed expected.

We strongly recommend storing this secret to use to verify future webhook event signatures. The POST request to create the webhook will then return with the status of the request. If you do not acknowledge the webhook's confirmation handshake that it fails to setup, you will receive an error in response to your attempt to create it.

This means you need to be able to receive and complete the webhook *while* the POST request is in-flight (in other words, have a server that can handle requests asynchronously).

[[GetCustomFieldsByCustomFieldGid]]
== Get Custom Field
`<asana:get-custom-fields-by-custom-field-gid>`


Get the complete definition of a custom field's metadata. Since custom fields can be defined for one of a number of types, and these types have different data and behaviors, there are fields that are relevant to a particular type. For instance, as noted above, enum_options is only relevant for the enum type and defines the set of choices that the enum could represent. The examples below show some of these type-specific custom field definitions. This operation makes an HTTP GET request to the /custom_fields/{custom_field_gid} endpoint.


=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]

| Configuration | String | The name of the configuration to use. | | x
| Custom field gid a| String |  Globally unique identifier for the custom field. |  | x
| Opt pretty a| Boolean |  Provides 'pretty'output. Provides the response in a 'pretty'format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging. |  false |
| Opt fields a| Array of String |  Defines fields to return. Some requests return *compact* representations of objects to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below. The ID of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options. |  |

[[GetEvents]]
== Get Events
`<asana:get-events>`


Returns the full record for all events that have occurred since the sync token was created. A GET request to the endpoint. /[path_to_resource]/events can be made in lieu of including the resource ID in the data for the request.

 NOTE: The resource returned will be the resource that triggered the event. This may be different from the one that the events were requested for. For example, a subscription to a project will contain events for tasks contained within the project.* This operation makes an HTTP GET request to the /events endpoint.

[[GetWorkspacesTasksSearchByWorkspaceGid]]
== Search Tasks For Workspace
`<asana:get-workspaces-tasks-search-by-workspace-gid>`


To mirror the functionality of the Asana web app's advanced search feature, the Asana API has a task search endpoint that allows you to build complex filters to find and retrieve the exact data you need. Premium access such as the Asana web product's advanced search feature is only available to premium Asana users. A user is premium if any of the following is true:

* The workspace in which the search is being performed is a premium workspace

* The user is a member of a premium team inside the workspace, even if a user is only a member of a premium team inside a non-premium workspace, the search will allow them to find data anywhere in the workspace, not just inside the premium team.

Making a search request using credentials of a non-premium user will result in a `402 Payment Required` error.

Pagination Search results are not stable; repeating the same query multiple times may return the data in a different order, even if the data does not change. Because of this, the traditional [pagination](https://developers.asana.com/docs/#pagination) available elsewhere in the Asana API is not available here.

However, you can paginate manually by sorting the search results by their creation time and then modifying each subsequent query to exclude data you have already seen. Page sizes are limited to a maximum of 100 items, and can be specified by the `limit` query parameter.

Eventual consistency Changes in Asana (regardless of whether they're made though the web product or the API) are forwarded to our search infrastructure to be indexed. This process can take between 10 and 60 seconds to complete under normal operation, and longer during some production incidents.

Making a change to a task that would alter its presence in a particular search query will not be reflected immediately. This is also true of the advanced search feature in the web product.

Rate limits - You might receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response if you hit any of our [rate limits](https://developers.asana.com/docs/#rate-limits).

[[GetWorkspacesTypeaheadByWorkspaceGid]]
== Typeahead For Workspace
`<asana:get-workspaces-typeahead-by-workspace-gid>`


Retrieves objects in the workspace based on an auto-completion or typeahead search algorithm. This feature is meant to provide results quickly, so do not rely on this API to provide extremely accurate search results. The result set is limited to a single page of results with a maximum size, so you won't be able to fetch large numbers of results.

he typeahead search API provides search for objects from a single workspace. This endpoint should be used to query for objects when creating an auto-completion/typeahead search feature. This API is meant to provide results quickly and should not be relied upon for accurate or exhaustive search results. The results sets are limited in size and cannot be paginated. Queries return a compact representation of each object which is typically the gid and name fields.

For a specific set of fields or all of the fields, use field selectors to manipulate what data is included in a response. Resources with type `user` are returned in order of most contacted to least contacted. This is determined by task assignments, adding the user to projects, and adding the user as a follower to tasks, messages, and so forth.

Resources with type `project` are returned in order of recency. This is determined when the user visits the project, is added to the project, and completes tasks in the project. Resources with type `task` are returned with priority placed on tasks the user is following, but no guarantee on the order of those tasks. Leaving the `query` string empty or omitted will give you results, by following the resource ordering as noted previously.

This could be used to list users or projects that are relevant for the requesting user's api token. This operation makes an HTTP GET request to the /workspaces/{workspace_gid}/typeahead endpoint.

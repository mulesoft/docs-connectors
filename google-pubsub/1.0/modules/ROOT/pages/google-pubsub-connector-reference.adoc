[[SeekMessages]]
== Seek Messages
`<pubsub:seek-messages>`


Supports bulk acknowledging or un-acknowledging of messages to a given snapshot or point of time based on the seekTarget provided. Seeking to a time marks every message received by Pub/Sub before the time as acknowledged, and all messages received after the time as unacknowledged. You can replay and reprocess previously acknowledged messages when seeking to a time in the past or purge messages when seeking to a time in the future.


If you seek to a timestamp using a subscription with a filter, the Pub/Sub service redelivers only the messages in the timestamp that match the filter of the subscription making the seek request. The snapshot feature enables you to capture the message acknowledgment state of a subscription. Once a snapshot is created, it retains:

* all messages that were unacknowledged in the source subscription at the time of the snapshot's creation.
* any messages published to the topic thereafter. You can replay these unacknowledged messages by using a snapshot to seek to any of the topic's subscriptions.


If you seek to a snapshot using a subscription with a filter, the Pub/Sub service redelivers only the messages in the snapshot that match the filter of the subscription making the seek request.


=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Configuration | String | Name of the configuration to use. | | x
| Config Ref a| ConfigurationProvider |  Name of the configuration used to execute this component. |  | x
| Project ID a| String |  Globally unique identifier for your project. |  |
| Subscription Name a| String |  Project-wide unique identifier for the subscription. |  |
| Snapshot Name a| String |  Snapshot to seek to. The snapshot's topic must be the same as that of the provided subscription. |  |
| Timestamp a| DateTime |  Specific time to seek to. Messages retained in the subscription that were published before this time are marked as acknowledged, and messages retained in the subscription that were published after this time are marked as unacknowledged.

Note that this operation affects only messages retained in the subscription (configured by the combination of *messageRetentionDuration* and *retainAckedMessages*), for example, if the time corresponds to a point before the message retention window (or to a point before the system's notion of the subscription creation time), only retained messages are marked as unacknowledged, and already-expunged messages will not be restored. A timestamp is in RFC3339 UTC Zulu format, with nanosecond resolution and up to nine fractional digits, such as 2014-10-02T15:01:23Z and 2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z. |  |
| Reconnection Strategy a| * <<Reconnect>>

[[Reconnection]]
=== Reconnection

Configures a reconnection strategy for an operation.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Fails Deployment a| Boolean | What to do if, when an app is deployed, a connectivity test does not pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy:

* `true`

Allow the deployment to fail.

* `false`

Ignore the results of the connectivity test. |  |
| Reconnection Strategy a| * <<Reconnect>>
* <<ReconnectForever>> | Reconnection strategy to use. |  |
|===

[[Reconnect]]
=== Reconnect

Configures a standard reconnection strategy, which specifies how often to reconnect and how many reconnection attempts the connector source or operation can make.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Frequency a| Number | How often to attempt to reconnect, in milliseconds. |  |
| Blocking a| Boolean | If `false`, the reconnection strategy will run in a separate, non-blocking thread. |  |
| Count a| Number | How many reconnection attempts the Mule app can make. |  |
|===

[[ReconnectForever]]
=== Reconnect Forever

Configures a forever reconnection strategy by which the connector source or operation attempts to reconnect at a specified frequency for as long as the Mule app runs.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Frequency a| Number | How often to attempt to reconnect, in milliseconds. |  |
| Blocking a| Boolean | If `false`, the reconnection strategy will run in a separate, non-blocking thread. |  |
|===


[[ExpirationPolicy]]
=== Expiration Policy

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Idle Time a| Number | Configures the maximum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before Mule considers it eligible for expiration. |  |
| Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS | Time unit for the *Max Idle Time* field. |  |
|===


[[RepeatableInMemoryStream]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Stream

Configures the in-memory streaming strategy by which the request fails if the data exceeds the MAX buffer size. Always run performance tests to find the optimal buffer size for your specific use case.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number |  Initial amount of memory to allocate to the data stream. If the streamed data exceeds this value, the buffer expands by *Buffer Size Increment*, with an upper limit of *Max In Memory Size value*. |  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | Amount by which the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of `0` or lower specifies that the buffer can't expand.  |  |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | Maximum size of the buffer. If the buffer size exceeds this value, Mule raises a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error. A value of less than or equal to `0` means no limit. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | Unit for the *Initial Buffer Size*, *Buffer Size Increment*, and *Buffer Unit* fields. |  |
|===

[[RepeatableFileStoreStream]]
=== Repeatable File Store Stream

Configures the repeatable file-store streaming strategy by which Mule keeps a portion of the stream content in memory. If the stream content is larger than the configured buffer size, Mule backs up the buffer’s content to disk and then clears the memory.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| In Memory Size a| Number | Maximum amount of memory that the stream can use for data. If the amount of memory exceeds this value, Mule buffers the content to disk. To optimize performance:

* Configure a larger buffer size to avoid the number of times Mule needs to write the buffer on disk. This increases performance, but it also limits the number of concurrent requests your application can process, because it requires additional memory.

* Configure a smaller buffer size to decrease memory load at the expense of response time. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | Unit for the *In Memory Size* field. |  |
|===

[[RedeliveryPolicy]]
=== Redelivery Policy

Configures the redelivery policy for executing requests that generate errors. You can add a redelivery policy to any source in a flow.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Redelivery Count a| Number | Maximum number of times that a redelivered request can be processed unsuccessfully before returning a REDELIVERY_EXHAUSTED error. |  |
| Message Digest Algorithm a| String | Secure hashing algorithm to use if the *Use Secure Hash* field is `true`. If the payload of the message is a Java object, Mule ignores this value and returns the value that the payload’s `hashCode()` returned. |  |
| Message Identifier a| <<RedeliveryPolicyMessageIdentifier>> | Defines which strategy is used to identify the messages. |  |
| Object Store a| ObjectStore | Configures the object store that stores the redelivery counter for each message.  |  |
|===

[[RedeliveryPolicyMessageIdentifier]]
=== Redelivery Policy Message Identifier

Configures how to identify a redelivered message and how to find out when the message was redelivered.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Use Secure Hash a| Boolean | If `true`, Mule uses a secure hash algorithm to identify a redelivered message. |  |
| Id Expression a| String | One or more expressions that determine when a message was redelivered. You can set this property only if the *Use Secure Hash* field is `false`. |  |
|===

[[Snapshot]]
=== Snapshot

Snapshot resource. Use snapshots in seek operations, which manage message acknowledgments in bulk.
This enables you to set the acknowledgment state of messages in an existing subscription to the state captured by a snapshot.


[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Name a| String | Name of the snapshot. |  |
| Topic a| String | Name of the topic from which the snapshot retains messages. |  |
| Expire Time a| DateTime | Time that the snapshot is guaranteed to exist up until. A newly-created snapshot expires no later than seven days from the time of its creation. Its exact lifetime is determined at creation by the existing backlog in the source subscription. The lifetime of the snapshot is seven days, which is the age of the oldest unacked message in the subscription. Consider a subscription with an oldest unacked message that is three days old. If a snapshot is created from this subscription, the snapshot, which always captures this three day old backlog as long as the snapshot exists, will expire in four days. The service will refuse to create a snapshot that will expire in less than one hour after creation. A timestamp is in RFC3339 UTC Zulu format, with nanosecond resolution and up to nine fractional digits, such as 2014-10-02T15:01:23Z and 2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z. |  |
| Labels a| Any | Object containing a list of key-value pairs, such as { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" }. |  |
|===

[[RepeatableInMemoryIterable]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Iterable

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | The number of instances to initially keep in memory to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can fit into this buffer, then the buffer expands according to the bufferSizeIncrement attribute, with an upper limit of maxInMemorySize. | 100 |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This is by how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer should not expand, meaning that a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised when the buffer gets full.  | 100 |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | The maximum amount of memory to use. If more than that is used then a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised. A value lower than or equal to zero means no limit. |  |
|===

[[RepeatableFileStoreIterable]]
=== Repeatable File Store Iterable

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| In Memory Objects a| Number | The maximum amount of instances to keep in memory. If more than that is required, content on the disk is buffered. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | Unit for the *In Memory Objects* field. |  |

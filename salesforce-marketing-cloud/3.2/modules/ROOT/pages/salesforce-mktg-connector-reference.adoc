=== Redelivery Policy

Configures the redelivery policy for executing requests that generate errors. You can add a redelivery policy to any source in a flow.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Redelivery Count a| Number | Maximum number of times that a redelivered request can be processed unsuccessfully before returning a `REDELIVERY_EXHAUSTED` error. |  |
| Message Digest Algorithm a| String | Secure hashing algorithm to use if the *Use Secure Hash* field is `true`. If the payload of the message is a Java object, Mule ignores this value and returns the value that the payload's `hashCode()` returned. |  |
| Message Identifier a| <<RedeliveryPolicyMessageIdentifier>> | One or more expressions that determine if a message was redelivered. This property can be set only if the *Use Secure Hash* field is `false`. |  |
| Object Store a| ObjectStore | Configures the object store that stores the redelivery counter for each message. |  |
|===

[[RedeliveryPolicyMessageIdentifier]]
=== Redelivery Policy Message Identifier

Configures how to identify a redelivered message and how to find out when the message was redelivered.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Use Secure Hash a| Boolean | If `true`, Mule uses a secure hash algorithm to identify a redelivered message. |  |
| Id Expression a| String | One or more expressions that determine when a message was redelivered. You can set this property only if the *Use Secure Hash* field is `false`. |  |
|===

[[RepeatableFileStoreIterable]]
=== Repeatable File Store Iterable

Configures the repeatable file store iterable type.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| In Memory Objects a| Number | Maximum amount of instances to keep in memory. If more than that is required, content on the disk is buffered. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | Unit for the *In Memory Objects* field. |  |
|===

[[RepeatableInMemoryIterable]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Iterable

Configures the repeatable in memory iterable type.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | Amount of instances to initially keep in memory to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can fit into this buffer, then the buffer expands according to the *Buffer Size Increment* attribute, with an upper limit of *Max In Memory Size*. Default value is 100 instances. |  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | Amount by which the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of `0` or lower specifies that the buffer can't expand. A `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error is raised when the buffer gets full. | `100` |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | Maximum amount of memory to use. If more than that is used, a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error is raised. A value lower than or equal to `0` means no limit. |  |
|===

[[StandardRevocationCheck]]
=== Standard Revocation Check

Configures standard revocation checks for TLS certificates.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Only End Entities a| Boolean a| Which elements to verify in the certificate chain:

* `true`
+
Verify only the last element in the certificate chain.

* `false`
+
Verify all elements in the certificate chain. |  |
| Prefer Crls a| Boolean a| How to check certificate validity:

* `true`
+
Check the Certification Revocation List (CRL) for certificate validity.

* `false`
+
Use the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) to check certificate validity. |  |
| No Fallback a| Boolean a| Whether to use the secondary method to check certificate validity:

* `true`
+
Use the method that wasn't specified in the *Prefer Crls* field (the secondary method) to check certificate validity.

* `false`
+
Do not use the secondary method to check certificate validity. |  |
| Soft Fail a| Boolean a| What to do if the revocation server can't be reached or is busy:

* `true`
+
Avoid verification failure.

* `false`
+
Allow the verification to fail. |  |
|===

[[Tls]]
=== TLS

Configures TLS to provide secure communications for the Mule app.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Enabled Protocols a| String | Comma-separated list of protocols enabled for this context. |  |
| Enabled Cipher Suites a| String | Comma-separated list of cipher suites enabled for this context. |  |
| Trust Store a| <<TrustStore>> | Configures the TLS truststore. |  |
| Key Store a| <<KeyStore>> | Configures the TLS keystore. |  |
| Revocation Check a| * <<StandardRevocationCheck>>
* <<CustomOcspResponder>>
* <<CrlFile>> | Configures a revocation checking mechanism. |  |
|===

[[TrustStore]]
=== Trust Store

Configures the truststore for TLS.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Path a| String | Path to the truststore. Mule resolves the path relative to the current classpath and file system. |  |
| Password a| String | Password used to protect the truststore. |  |
| Type a| String | Type of truststore. |  |
| Algorithm a| String | Encryption algorithm that the truststore uses. |  |
| Insecure a| Boolean | If `true`, Mule stops performing certificate validations. Setting this to `true` can make connections vulnerable to attacks. |  |
|===

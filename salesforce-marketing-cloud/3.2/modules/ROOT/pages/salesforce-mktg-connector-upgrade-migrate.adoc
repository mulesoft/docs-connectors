== Upgrade Prerequisites

Before you perform the upgrade, you must:

. Create a backup of your files, data, and configuration in case you must restore to the previous version.
. Install Salesforce Marketing Cloud Connector v3.x.x.

== Upgrade Steps

Follow these steps to perform the upgrade from Salesforce Marketing Cloud Connector v2.2.x to Salesforce Marketing Cloud Connector v3.x.x:

. In Anypoint Studio, create a Mule project.
. In the Mule Palette view, click *Search in Exchange*.
. In the *Add Dependencies to Project* window, enter `Salesforce Marketing Cloud 3` in the search field.
. In the *Available modules* section, select *Salesforce Marketing Cloud Connector* and click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.
. Verify that the `mule-sfdc-marketing-cloud-connector` dependency version is `3.x.x` in the `pom.xml` file, where the first `x` is the minor release number and the second `x` is the patch release number.

Studio upgrades the connector automatically.

== Verify the Upgrade

After you install the latest version of the connector, follow these steps to verify the upgrade:

. In Studio, verify that there are no errors in the *Problems* or *Console* views.
. Check the project `pom.xml` file and verify that there are no problems.
. Test the connection and verify that the operations work.

== Troubleshooting

If there are problems with caching the parameters or caching the metadata, try restarting Studio.

== Revert the Upgrade

If it is necessary to revert to the previous version of Salesforce Marketing Cloud Connector, change the `mule-sfdc-marketing-cloud-connector` dependency version `3.x.x` in the project's `pom.xml` file to the previous version.

== Prerequisites

To use this information, you should be familiar with Salesforce Marketing, Mule runtime engine (Mule), Anypoint Connectors, Anypoint Studio, Mule concepts, elements in a Mule flow, and Global Elements.

You need login credentials to test your connection to your target resource.

For software requirements and compatibility
information, see the Connector Release Notes.

== POM File Information

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.mulesoft.connectors</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-sfdc-marketing-cloud-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
</dependency>
----

Replace `x.x.x` with the version that corresponds to the connector you are using. To obtain the most up-to-date `pom.xml` file information:

. Go to https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Anypoint Exchange].
. In Exchange, click *Login* and supply your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. In Exchange, search for `<connector-name>`.
. Select the connector.
. Click *Dependency Snippets* near the upper right of the screen.

== What's New in this Connector

This connector version has the same operations as the 2.x versions, but groups some of them differently. Also, the connector no longer uses FuelSDK. Instead, the connector performs the SOAP requests itself.

== Connect in Design Center

* The `Configure Create`, `Configure Update`, and `Configure Delete` operations are grouped into one operation called `Configure`. Use a parameter to specify the `Create`, `Update`, and `Delete` actions.

* The `Perform Start`, `Perform Stop`, and `Perform Get Max Count` operations are grouped into one operation called `Perform`. Use a parameter to specify the `Start`, `Stop`, `Get`, and `Max Count` actions.

The connector no longer supports OAuth Username and Password authentication because the Salesforce Marketing Cloud deprecated this authentication type. The connector now supports OAuth Client Credentials authentication.

== Known Issues and Limitations

Salesforce Marketing Cloud Connector has some limitations, including when:

* Working with subclasses inside complex fields
* Trying to retrieve fields from a hierarchy
* Attempting to return an Automation object.

=== Working with Subclasses Inside Complex Fields

Some objects in Salesforce Marketing Cloud have complex fields, such as the Recurrence field, which belong to a base class. DataSense can only bring up fields specific to the base class.

To use additional fields that belong to a subclass of a base class, manually add the desired fields to the Transform Message component. For Salesforce Marketing Cloud to know that you want to work with a subclass and recognize the fields you added, you must also add a field called concreteClassType of type String whose value is the name of the subclass.

See xref:index.adoc#providing-subclass[Providing a Subclass as a Type to a Complex Field] for an example detailing how to achieve this.

=== Retrieve Operation Limitations

The Retrieve operation enables you to retrieve records in a SQL query-like fashion. When you use the Retrieve operation, Salesforce Marketing Cloud prevents the retrieval of fields that are part of a hierarchy. For example, the Subscriber object has a complex structure:

image::salesforce-mktg-as-subscriber-structure.png[subscriber structure]

The API only allows you to query fields on the first level, such as `EmailAddress` or `SubscriberKey`, but not fields such as `Attributes.Name`.

The `Retrieve` operation supports filters for querying the data. However the filters do not behave like an SQL filter condition. For example, a clause such as `WHERE 1=1` works in SQL, but results in an error in Salesforce Marketing Cloud because the API doesn't support it. In this example, the operand to the left of the equal sign must be a valid property of the Salesforce data extension (SFDE).

When executing the request with the `WHERE 1=1` clause, the filter expects a property. It is transformed into the following request:

`<Filter xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="SimpleFilterPart"> <Property>1</Property> <SimpleOperator>equals</SimpleOperator> <Value>1</Value> </Filter>`.

The response is:

 `<OverallStatus>Error: The Filter Property '1' is not a retrievable property.</OverallStatus>`.

When filtering the results of a query, only the following operators are supported in WHERE clauses:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Operator | Salesforce Marketing API equivalent
| = | equals
| <> | notEquals
| > | greaterThan
| >= | greaterThanOrEqual
| < | lessThan
| <= | lessThanOrEqual
| like | like
|===

LIMIT and OFFSET clauses are not supported.

=== Server Results Containing an Automation Object

Server results that contain an Automation object cause an exception to be thrown. When performing an operation, such as Create or Delete, on an Automation object, the returned result contains the structure of the Automation object you acted upon. The server also returns an additional field in the Automation object called isPlatformObject that is not recognized by the WSDL.

To bypass this issue, make all operations that directly use an Automation object asynchronous. If an operation is asynchronous, the immediate response of the operation is `Operation Queued`.

For more information, see the xref:index.adoc#asynchronous-operations[Asynchronous Operations].

== Common Use Cases

Use Salesforce Marketing Cloud Connector operations for the following common use cases:

* `Configure action` operation - Calls the Configure method with Create, Delete, or Update as the value of the Action parameter when connected to the Marketing Cloud API SOAP web service.
* `Create entities` operation - Creates new objects on the Marketing Cloud API web server.
* `Delete objects` operation - Deletes existing objects on the Marketing Cloud API web server.
* `Perform operation` - Calls the Perform method with the GetMaxCount, Start, or Stop as the value of the Action parameter when connected to the Marketing Cloud API SOAP web service.
* `Retrieve entities` operation - Retrieves objects from the Marketing Cloud API web server in a SQL query-like fashion.
* `Schedule start` operation - Calls the Schedule method with Start as the value of the Action parameter when connected to the Marketing Cloud API SOAP web service.
* `Update entities` operation - Updates existing objects on the Marketing Cloud API web server.
* `Upsert entities` operation - Creates objects on the Marketing Cloud API web server if the objects do not already exist, or deletes existing objects on the server.

=== Add a Proxy

To use a proxy server, set the following configuration properties on the *Advanced* tab of your configuration:

image::salesforce-mktg-3-proxy.png[Schedule Start Automation]

[[providing-subclass]]
=== Providing a Subclass as a Type to a Complex Field

Suppose you want to schedule an existing Automation that sends emails to a subscriber list once per minute. To do this, add a Schedule Reference to the connector through a flow variable:

image::salesforce-mktg-3-schedule-start-automation.png[Schedule Start Automation]

Use the *Recurrence* field in *ScheduleDefinition* to provide information such as how much time to pass between sending emails. The *Recurrence* field is a complex field that has no structure.

To specify a MinutelyRecurrence instead of a Recurrence:

* Manually add the fields belonging to the MinutelyRecurrence class.

* Add an additional field called concreteClassType of type String whose value is the name of the subclass.

The mapping for the ScheduleDefinition looks like this in the example:

image::salesforce-mktg-3-schedule-definition-transform-config.png[Schedule Definition]

This map has a field called `minuteInterval` that belongs to a subclass of Recurrence called `MinutelyRecurrence`.

For the connector to use the MinutelyRecurrence object, you must also add the concreteClassType field with `MinutelyRecurrence` as the value.

 [[asynchronous-operations]]
=== Asynchronous Operations

Most operations are synchronous by default, meaning that the connector waits for the result of the operation. For more details regarding the operations of the Marketing Cloud API, access the Salesforce Marketing Cloud Methods documentation.

To specify that you want an operation to behave asynchronously, use the Options parameter for the operation.

The following example creates a list of Automation objects to provide in the payload. Because the result of any operation that works directly with Automation objects throws an exception caused by the presence of an unknown field, the example uses the CreateOptions parameter to make the call asynchronous. In this example, the CreateOptions value is provided in a variable called `vars`.

image::salesforce-mktg-3-create-automation-config.png[Create Automation]

This mapping for CreateOptions in vars looks like this:

* The requestType field determines the type of call (SYNCHRONOUS or ASYNCHRONOUS).
* The conversationID field assigns a unique identifier to the asynchronous call.

You can group asynchronous calls together using the conversationID, callsInConversation, and sequenceCode fields. For example, suppose you want to make five asynchronous calls to the server, execute the calls together, and specify their execution order. To do this:

. Assign the same conversationID to each call.
. Set the callsInConversation field to 5.
. Use the sequenceCode field to order the calls.

The following example has a single call, so it passes a value of 1 to callsInConversation and sequenceCode.

image::salesforce-mktg-as-create-automation-options.png[CreateOptions]

The Options parameter has more functionality than shown in this example. For more information, see the Salesforce Marketing Cloud Objects documentation.

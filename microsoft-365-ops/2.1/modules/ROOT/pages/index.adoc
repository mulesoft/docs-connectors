:page-aliases: connectors::microsoft/microsoft-365-ops-connector.adoc

Support Category: https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#anypoint-connectors[Select]


Anypoint Connector for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations (Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations Connector) enables integration with Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations Web API. You can configure this connector using the Flow Designer feature of Design Center or using Anypoint Studio. This connector enables connection types for OAuth 2 or OAuth 2 with a username and password.

This connector enables you to perform these operations:

* Authorize or unauthorize access to a Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations server
* Create a recurring job on Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations server
* Retrieve multiple entries, including retrieval using DataSense Query Language
* Execute operations


== Prerequisites

* For software requirements and compatibility information, see the xref:release-notes::connector/anypoint-connector-release-notes.adoc[Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations Connector Release Notes].
* Familiarity with Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations and Anypoint Platform, including Mule runtime engine, Anypoint Studio, elements in a Mule flow, and Global Elements.
* You need login credentials to test your connection to your target resource.
* To use this connector with Apache Maven, view the `pom.xml` file dependency information in *Dependency Snippets* for this connector in https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange/com.mulesoft.connectors/mule-microsoft-dynamics365-for-operations-connector/[Anypoint Exchange].
* You need access to a Microsoft Dynamics 365 instance (online or on-premise) managed by Azure Active Directory.

+
The Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations Connector does not provide a trigger operation.
+
. Select the plus sign (*+*).
. In *Select a component*, search for "op", and click *Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations Connector*.
. Click an operation:
+
[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Operation |Description
|Execute Operation |Execute a request using a URL.
|Import Data Recurring Job |Submit data to recurring data jobs.
|Retrieve Multiple |Retrieve multiple entities by URL.
|Retrieve Multiple By Query |Retrieve multiple entities by DSQL query.
|Unauthorize |Deletes all access token information for a resource owner ID to prevent operation execution until re-authorized.
|===
+
. Select *Click here to set it up*.
. Specify the connection type as *OAuth 2* or *OAuth Username Password*:
+

+
. Provide all other required values.
+
For more information, see the xref:microsoft-365-ops-connector-reference.adoc[Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations Connector Reference].
+
. If using the *Retrieve Multiple* operation, configure the *Data Query URL* field:

+
The *Data Query URL* field is in ODATA format.

=== Configure OAuth 2

These fields require values in Flow Designer for configuring the OAuth 2 connection type:

[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|Resource |The OAuth endpoint URL.
|Consumer Key |The app ID assigned to your app when you registered it with Azure Active Directory. You can find this in the Azure Portal (portal.azure.com). Click *Active Directory*, click the directory, choose the app, and click *Configure*.
|Consumer Secret |The app secret that you created in the app registration portal for your app. This should not be used in a native app, because client secrets cannot be reliably stored on devices. This is required for web apps and web APIs, which have the ability to store the client secret securely on the server side. You can find this in the Azure Portal (portal.azure.com). A client secret is a numerical value known only to your app and the Azure server, which enables access for your app.
|Authorization URL |Tenant-specific OAuth2 endpoint in the format: `+https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/authorize+` (follow instructions presented in the previous link for specific information on how to obtain the endpoint). To find the *Authorization URL* and the *Access token URL*, browse to the Microsoft Azure portal, *App registrations* section, and select the *Endpoints* menu.
|Access token URL |Tenant-specific endpoint for requesting the access token in the format: `+https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/token+` (follow instructions presented in the previous link for specific information on how to obtain the endpoint).
|Listener config |Name of the HTTP Listener instance created in the Studio flow.
|Callback path |The URL of your app, to which authentication responses can be sent and received by your app (follow instructions presented in the above link for specific information on how to obtain the endpoint).
|Authorize path |The URL that triggers the OAuth mechanism.
|External callback URL |Required only if the callback URL is not accessible directly (example: when using proxies) example format: `+http://localhost:8081/callback+`
|===

image::microsoft-365-ops-dc-oauth2.png[]

See Microsoft's https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-protocols-oauth-code[Authorize access to web apps using OAuth 2 and Azure Active Directory].

NOTE: If using the *Retrieve Multiple* operation, configure the *Data Query URL* field, which is in ODATA format.

=== Configure OAuth 2 Username Password

These fields require values in Flow Designer when configuring OAuth 2 with a username and password:

[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|Username |Username used to initialize the session.
|Password |Password used to authenticate the user.
|Resource |The app ID URI of the web API (secured resource). This must be the root URI, without specifying the version: for example, `+https://YOUR_ORG.operations.dynamics.com/+`
|Client ID |The ID assigned to your app when you registered it with Azure Active Directory. You can find this in the Azure Portal (portal.azure.com). Click *Active Directory*, click the directory, choose the app, and click *Configure*.
|Client Secret |The secret that you created in the app registration portal for your app. This should not be used in a native app, because client secrets cannot be reliably stored on devices. This is required for web apps and web APIs, which have the ability to store the client secret securely on the server side. You can find this in the Azure Portal (portal.azure.com). A client secret is a numerical value known only to your app and the Azure server, which enables access for your app.
|Token Request Endpoint |The token endpoint that is called to get the access token. Example: `+https://login.windows.net/TENANT_ID/oauth2/token+` where TENANT_ID is the Azure Active Directory ID.
|===

== Use Case: Accept Data and Output into JSON

This use case enables you to work with the features of Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations using
the *Retrieve Multiple* operation.

. Listener (HTTP) - Accepts data from HTTP requests.
. Dynamics AX for Operations - Connects and executes a query to retrieve all the customer entities.
. Transform message - Outputs the results of the *Retrieve Multiple* operation in JSON format.

image::microsoft-365-ops-studio-use-case.png[]

Use a properties file to define these attributes for use in the flow:

* `username="${operations.username}"`
* `password="${operations.password}"`
* `resource="${operations.resource}"`
* `clientId="${operations.client_id}"`
* `clientSecret="${operations.client_secret}"`
* `tokenRequestEndpoint="${operations.request_endpoint}"`

You can paste this XML code into Anypoint Studio to experiment with the flow:

==== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | Name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | |x
| Connection a| Connection
 | Connection type for this configuration.| |x
| Expiration Policy a| ExpirationPolicy | Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before Mule considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the instance expires at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. Mule purges the instances when appropriate. |  |
| Mule application namespace ID (MSH-3-1/MSH-5-1) a| String a|  Application namespace ID for Mule in the message header (MSH segment). If set, this value affects both receive and send message handling:

* On the receive side, the MSH receiving application namespace ID must match this value. 
* On the send side, the connector uses this value as the MSH sending application namespace ID unless the send configuration or message parameters override it. |  |
| Mule Application universal ID (MSH-3-2/MSH-5-2) a| String a| Application universal ID for Mule in the message header (MSH segment). If set, this value affects both receive and send message handling:

*  On the receive side, the MSH receiving application universal ID must match this value. 
* On the send side, the connector uses this value as the MSH sending application universal ID unless it is overridden in the send configuration or message parameters. |  |
| Mule Application universal ID Type (MSH-3-3/MSH-5-3) a| String a| Application universal ID type for Mule in the message header (MSH segment). If set, this value affects both receive and send message handling:

* On the receive side, the MSH receiving application universal ID type must match this value.
* On the send side, the connector uses this value as the MSH sending application universal ID type unless it is overridden in the send configuration or message parameters. |  |
| Partner Application Namespace ID (MSH-3-1/MSH-5-1) a| String a| Application namespace ID for the partner in the message header (MSH segment). If set, this value affects both receive and send message handling:

* On the receive side, the MSH sending application namespace ID must match this value.
* On the send side, the connector uses this value as the MSH sending application namespace ID unless it is overridden in the send configuration or message parameters. |  |
| Partner Application universal ID (MSH-3-2/MSH-5-2) a| String a|  Application universal ID for the partner in the message header (MSH segment). If set, this value affects both receive and send message handling: 

* On the receive side, the MSH sending application universal ID must match this value.
* On the send side, the connector uses this value as the MSH sending application universal ID unless it is overridden in the send configuration or message parameters. |  |
| Partner Application universal ID Type (MSH-3-3/MSH-5-3) a| String a| Application universal ID type for the partner in the message header (MSH segment). If set, this value affects both receive and send message handling:

* On the receive side, the MSH sending application universal ID type must match this value.
* On the send side, the connector uses this value as the MSH sending application universal ID type unless it is overridden in the send configuration or message parameters. |  |
| Schema definitions a| Array of String |  List of schema paths for the connector to use. The paths can be filesystem paths or classpaths. |  |x
| Event and message to message structure map path a| String a| Path to a YAML file that defines the mapping of the event code and message code to the message structure ID:

* If working with multiple message structures, this mapping definition supports using MSH-9-1 and MSH-9-2 to determine the message structure when MSH-9-3 is not present in a message. 
* If only a single message structure is present in the schemas for which this message structure is used, the connector uses the message structure to parse all messages. 
* If MSH-9-3 is present in a message, the connector ignores the MSH-9-1 and MSH-9-2 values. |  |

== Types

[[ExpirationPolicy]]
=== Expiration Policy

Configures the maximum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before Mule considers it eligible for expiration.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Idle Time a| Number | Maximum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before Mule considers it eligible for expiration. |  |
| Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS | A time unit that qualifies the *Max Idle Time* field. |  |

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Frequency |  Number| How often to attempt to reconnect, in milliseconds.| |
|===

[[non-repeatable-stream]]

[[reconnection]]

Configures reconnection options.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Fails deployment when test connection fails a| Boolean a| What to do if, when an app is deployed, a connectivity test does not pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy:

| Reconnection Strategy a| 
* None 
* <<standard>>

[[repeatable-file-store-stream]]
=== Repeatable File Store Stream

Configures the repeatable file store streaming strategy by which Mule keeps a portion of the stream content in memory. If the stream content is larger than the configured buffer size, Mule backs up the bufferâ€™s content to disk and then clears the memory.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max In Memory Size a| Number a| Maximum amount of memory that the stream can use for data. If the amount of memory exceeds this value, Mule buffers the content to disk. To optimize performance:

* Configure a larger buffer size to avoid the number of times Mule needs to write the buffer on disk. This increases performance, but it also limits the number of concurrent requests your application can process, because it requires additional memory.

* Configure a smaller buffer size to decrease memory load at the expense of response time. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | Unit for the *Max In Memory Size* field. |  |
|===

[[repeatable-in-memory-stream]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Stream

Configures the in-memory streaming strategy by which the request fails if the data exceeds the maximum buffer size. Always run performance tests to find the optimal buffer size for your specific use case.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | Initial amount of memory to allocate to the data stream. If the streamed data exceeds this value, the buffer expands by the *Buffer Size Increment*, with an upper limit of the *Max Buffer Size* value. |  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | Amount by which the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of `0` or lower specifies that the buffer can't expand. |  |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | Maximum size of the buffer. If the buffer size exceeds this value, Mule raises a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error. A value of less than or equal to `0` means no limit.|  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | Unit for the *Initial Buffer Size*, *Buffer Size Increment*, and *Max Buffer Size* fields.|  |
|===

[[standard]]
=== Standard

Configures a standard reconnection strategy, which specifies how often to reconnect and how many reconnection attempts the connector operation can make.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Frequency a| Number | How often to attempt to reconnect, in milliseconds. |  |
| Reconnection Attempts a| Number | How many reconnection attempts the Mule app can make. |  |
|===

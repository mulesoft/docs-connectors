= Azure Event Hubs Connector Reference 1.1 - Mule 4

Anypoint Connector for Azure Event Hubs (Azure Event Hubs Connector) enables support for event producing and consuming.


== Configurations
---
[[AzureEventhubs]]
=== Azure Event Hubs


This class represents an extension configuration, values set in this class are commonly used across multiple operations since they represent something core from the extension.


==== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | Name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x
| Connection a| * <<AzureEventhubs_ActiveDirectoryAuthentication, Active Directory Authentication>>

| Name a| String |  ID used to reference this configuration. |  | x
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures an expiration policy for the configuration.   |  | 
|===

==== Connection Types
[[AzureEventhubs_ActiveDirectoryAuthentication]]
===== Active Directory Authentication

Azure Event Hubs Connector offers two mechanisms to connect to Azure Event Hubs using Active Directory:

* Connect with Token Credentials Properties (TenantId, ClientId, and ClientSecret) via service principal authentication.
* Connect using DefaultAzureCredential that belong to Azure.Identity library.

| Correlation Id a| String | Correlation ID. |  | 
| Enqueued Time a| DateTime | The date and time, in UTC, of when the event was enqueued in the Event Hub partition.  |  | 
| Message Id a| String | An application-defined value that uniquely identifies the event. The identifier is a free-form value and can reflect a GUID or an identifier derived from the application context. |  |

[[RepeatableInMemoryStream]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Stream

Configures the in-memory streaming strategy by which the request fails if the data exceeds the MAX buffer size. Always run performance tests to find the optimal buffer size for your specific use case.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | Initial amount of memory to allocate to the data stream. If the streamed data exceeds this value, the buffer expands by *Buffer Size Increment*, with an upper limit of *Max In Memory Size value*. |  | 
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This is by how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer should not expand, meaning that a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised when the buffer gets full. |  | 
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | Maximum size of the buffer. If the buffer size exceeds this value, Mule raises a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error. A value of less than or equal to `0` means no limit. |  | 
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | Unit for the *Initial Buffer Size*, *Buffer Size Increment*, and *Buffer Unit* fields. |  | 
|===

[[RepeatableFileStoreStream]]
=== Repeatable File Store Stream

Configures the repeatable file-store streaming strategy by which Mule keeps a portion of the stream content in memory. If the stream content is larger than the configured buffer size, Mule backs up the buffer's content to disk and then clears the memory.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| In Memory Size a| Number | Maximum amount of memory that the stream can use for data. If the amount of memory exceeds this value, Mule buffers the content to disk. To optimize performance:

* Configure a larger buffer size to avoid the number of times Mule needs to write the buffer on disk. This increases performance, but it also limits the number of concurrent requests your application can process, because it requires additional memory.

* Configure a smaller buffer size to decrease memory load at the expense of response time. |  | 
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | Unit for the *In Memory Size* field. |  | 
|===

[[RedeliveryPolicy]]

| Message Digest Algorithm a| String | Secure hashing algorithm to use if the *Use Secure Hash* field is `true`. If the payload of the message is a Java object, Mule ignores this value and returns the value that the payload's `hashCode()` returned. |  | 
| Message Identifier a| <<RedeliveryPolicyMessageIdentifier>> | One or more expressions that determine if a message was redelivered. This property can be set only if the *Use Secure Hash* field is `false`. |  | 
| Object Store a| ObjectStore | Configures the object store that stores the redelivery counter for each message. |  | 
|===

[[RedeliveryPolicyMessageIdentifier]]

| Use Secure Hash a| Boolean | If `true`, Mule uses a secure hash algorithm to identify a redelivered message. |  | 
| Id Expression a| String | One or more expressions that determine when a message was redelivered. You can set this property only if the *Use Secure Hash* field is `false`. |  |

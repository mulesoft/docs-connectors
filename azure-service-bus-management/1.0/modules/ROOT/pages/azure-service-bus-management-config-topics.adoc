= Azure Service Bus Management 1.0 Additional Configuration Topics - Mule 4

Anypoint Azure Service Management connector cannot perform a connectivity test at startup using the `Test Connection` configuration option when you restrict access to your resources
and you have a security policy with permissions at the resource level only. This scenario occurs because the security policy targets the root level of the namespace, which might be forbidden due to the customized policy applied to the shared access key.

// *Ask about this* Skip the connectivity test with the configuration option available to this purpose, otherwise connetorâ€™s startup will fail.

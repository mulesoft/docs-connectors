Support Category: https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#anypoint-connectors[Select]

Anypoint Connector for Microsoft Azure Service Bus Management (Azure Service Bus Management Connector) enables management integration with Azure Service Bus on the cloud. This connector connects to the Azure REST API and supports management operations for queues, topics, and subscriptions. In addition, you can use the built-in management API to discover Azure Service Bus objects automatically and provision them.

[NOTE]
This connector supports integrations with Azure Service Bus (cloud). It does not work with Microsoft Windows Service Bus (on-premise). To connect with Microsoft Windows Service Bus on-premise, use https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange/com.mulesoft.connectors/mule-microsoft-service-bus-connector/[Anypoint Connector for Microsoft Windows Service Bus].

To use the Azure management API for message integration with Azure Service Bus on the cloud, use the Anypoint Connector for Azure Service Bus.

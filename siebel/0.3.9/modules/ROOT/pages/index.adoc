_Premium_

The Anypoint Connector for Siebel lets you access connections between Mule integration applications and the Oracle Siebel customer relationship manager (CRM).

*Release Notes*: xref:release-notes::connector/siebel-connector-release-notes.adoc[Siebel Connector Release Notes]

The Siebel Connector is composed of three separate modules, each providing different options for connecting with Siebel applications:

* Oracle Siebel Business Objects: Create, update, upsert, query, and delete Siebel business components.
* Oracle Siebel Integration Objects: Create, update, upsert, query, delete, query page, execute, and synchronize Siebel integration objects.
* Oracle Siebel Business Services: Execute Siebel business services.

Each option is available after you install the corresponding Siebel connector.
The Siebel connector is built using the Siebel Java Data Beans interface. Java Data Beans provides a native Java interface to access the Siebel Object Manager.
The Siebel Object Manager lets a connector use a generic interface that doesn’t depend on a customized installation. To discover the metadata of Siebel objects in design time, use DataSense in Anypoint Studio. The Siebel connector takes advantage of the Siebel Repository to show a list of available objects as well as their structures in a Siebel custom installation.
The objects can be business components, business objects, integration objects, or business services based on the connector type you have installed.

== Prerequisites

Because of how closely the connector is coupled with Siebel CRM, this document assumes you have a working knowledge of Siebel Business Components, Business Objects, Business Services, and Integration Objects.
This document also assumes that you are familiar with Mule, Anypoint Connectors,
Anypoint Studio essentials, elements in a Mule flow, and global elements.

This document describes implementation examples within the context of Anypoint Studio, Mule’s graphical user interface, and, in parallel,
includes configuration details for doing the same in the XML Editor.

=== Requirements

The Siebel connector requires the following two Siebel JAR files: Siebel.jar and SiebelJI_xxx..

Choose the SiebelJI_xxx.jar based on the locale of the Siebel installation. For instance, if the locale of Siebel installation is US_EN, use SiebelJI_enu.jar.
The Siebel.jar and SiebelJI_enu.jar are available in the `+%SIEBEL_HOME%\8.1\Tools_1\CLASSES+` folder on the Siebel server.  %SIEBEL_HOME% is the installation directory of Siebel.

You can add the JAR files to your Studio project while configuring the Siebel global element.

=== Dependencies

This connector requires Mule Runtime to work.

=== Compatibility Matrix

[%header]
|===
|Application/Service |Version
|Mule Runtime |3.6.1 or higher
|Siebel | v8.1
|===

The Siebel v3.x connector is built and tested using Oracle Siebel 8.1 and IP2016.17. Because the Java Data Bean interface is generic, the Siebel v3.x connector works with Siebel versions 7.7, 7.8, and 8.0. However, the compatibility of the connector with any other version beside 8.1 and IP2016.17 has not been tested. The connector is not compatible with Siebel v7.5 and below.


== To Install this Connector

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio taskbar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange.
. Search for the connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

When Studio has an update, a message displays in the lower right corner, which you can click to install the update.

You must select which Siebel connector you want to install (choose between the Oracle Siebel Business Objects, Oracle Siebel Business Services, and Oracle Siebel Integration Objects). Each Siebel connector installs separately.

To use a Siebel connector in a production environment, you must have either an Enterprise license to use Mule
or a CloudHub Starter, Professional, or Enterprise account.

Contact the MuleSoft Sales Team to arrange for either license. See also xref:3.9@mule-runtime::installing-an-enterprise-license.adoc[Installing an Enterprise License].
Studio displays the Siebel Connector you installed in the palette.

The connectors displayed are:

* Oracle Siebel Business Objects: Connects to Siebel business objects and components, which define business logic and encapsulate table data.
* Oracle Siebel Business Services: Connects to Siebel business services to perform specific business functions or tasks.
* Oracle Siebel Integration Objects: Connects to Siebel integration objects, providing a dynamic and hierarchical structure of business components

=== Updating From an Older Version

There should be three available Siebel Connectors (Oracle Siebel Business Objects Connector, Siebel Business Services Connector, and Siebel Integration Objects Connector).

When you choose to install one of the connectors, a screen appears that asks you to uninstall your old version of the connector and install the new one.

After the installation is completed, you can use the operations available to the Siebel Connector you installed. To use the other operations, you must install the remaining Siebel connectors.

=== Creating a New Project

To use the Siebel connector in a Mule application project:

. In Studio, select File > New > Mule Project. +
. Enter a name for your new project and leave the remaining options with their default values.
. If you plan to use Git, check the Create a .gitignore file checkbox for the project to create a default gitignore file for Studio Projects, and then click Next.
. Click Finish to create the project.

== Configuring the Siebel Global Element in the Studio Visual Editor

To use the Siebel connector in your Mule application, configure a global element for the  Siebel connector you wish to use:

* Business Objects
* Business Services
* Integration Objects

To configure the Siebel connector global elements in your Mule application:

. Click the Global Elements tab at the base of the canvas.
. On the Global Mule Configuration Elements screen, click Create.
. In the Choose Global Type wizard, expand Connector Configuration, and then select the connector you want to configure: Oracle Siebel Business Objects, Oracle Siebel Business Services, or Oracle Siebel Integration Objects.
+
. Click OK
. Enter the global element properties: +

== Example Use Case

Poll a Siebel connector at a regular interval, looking for new registries, and send the output into Salesforce.

[NOTE]
The DataMapper and DataWeave elements are roughly interchangeable. You must make certain adjustments to get the transformation you need. Refer to the applicable documentation.


Refer to documentation on the Poll Scope, DataMapper or DataWeave, and the Salesforce connector for in-depth information about these Mule elements.


image::example-use-case.jpg[Demo Flow,500]

. Create a Mule project in your Anypoint Studio.
. Drag a Poll Scope to a new flow. +
+
image::poll2.jpg[]
. xref:3.9@mule-runtime::poll-reference.adoc[Poll Reference] executes any Mule element you place inside it at regular intervals. In this case, it is a Siebel endpoint.
. Configure the Poll Scope as follows.
+
image::pollnew.jpg[]
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|Frequency |60000
|Start Delay |0
|Time Unit |MILLISECONDS
|Enable Watermark |check
|Variable Name |lastUpdate
|Default Expression |`#[new org.joda.time.DateTime().withZone(org.joda.time.DateTimeZone.forID("PST8PDT")).minusSeconds(5).toString("MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss")]`
|Update Expression |`#[new org.joda.time.DateTime().withZone(org.joda.time.DateTimeZone.forID("PST8PDT")).minusSeconds(5).toString("MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss")]`
|===
+
The poll scope triggers once a minute. The watermark ensures that registries in the Siebel DB aren't processed more than once. It does this by keeping track of the last element processed in the last poll.
+
[NOTE]
To learn how watermarks work and what each attribute is for, read about xref:runtime-manager::managing-schedules.adoc[Poll Schedulers].
. Drag an Oracle Siebel Business Objects connector into the space provided by the Poll Scope.
+
image::poll.jpg[]
+
The Siebel connector is now polled at the intervals you specified in the Poll Scope.
+
. Open Siebel connector's properties editor, and next to the Config Reference field, click the plus sign to add a new Global Element.
+
image::boconfig.jpg[]

. On the Global Element Properties window, configure the global element according to the settings below:
+

|View Mode |3
|fields-to-retrieve |Create Object Manually
|search-spec |None
|Operation |Query business components
|===
+
Note: The search expression uses the same variable that is being updated by the Poll Scope. In this way, the Siebel connector returns only those DB records that Mule hasn't processed in the last poll.
+
[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|Child Element |Description
|siebel:fields-to-retrieve |Lists the output fields of the query

== Configuring a Global Element with the XML Editor or Standalone

To use the Siebel connector in your Mule application, configure a global element for the  Siebel connector you wish to use:

* Business Objects
* Business Services
* Integration Objects

. At the start of your project, add a Salesforce Global Element to set up global configuration attributes for this connector:

. Add a DataWeave component between the first logger and the Salesforce connector. It maps fields from the data structure returned by Siebel into the data structure required by Salesforce
+
[source,xml]
----
<data-mapper:transform doc:name="DataWeave"/>
----
+
. Switch to Studio Visual editor to configure DataWeave correctly. Click  the DataWeave icon to edit its fields:
+
[TIP]
If you have already configured both connectors properly, DataWeave should be able to automatically suggest the mapping you need to make.
+
Input:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|Type |Connector
|Connector |Oracle_Siebel_Business_Object
|Operation |query-business-components
|Object |List<Contact.Contact>
|===
+
Output:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|Type |Connector
|Connector |Salesforce
|Operation |create
|Object |List<Contact>
|===
+
. Click Create mapping for DataWeave to build a mapping between both data structures.
. A few fields don't have the same names in Salesforce as they do in Siebel. You must configure them manually.
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name in Siebel |Name in Salesforce
|Email_Address |Email
|First_Name |FirstName
|Last_Name |LastName
|===
+
There are two ways in which you can link these:
+
.. Look for the fields on both columns in DataLoader's graphical view, then simply drag and drop one onto the other.
+
This is usually the easiest way to go, but given the number of fields to navigate, it may be hard to find the fields you need. Use the search box above the field list to find these quickly.
+
.. Enter DataLoader's Script view and paste the following lines of code below what is already written:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
output.Email = input.Email_Address;
output.FirstName = input.First_Name;
output.LastName = input.Last_Name;
----
+
The full code should look like this:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
//MEL
//START -> DO NOT REMOVE
output.__id = input.__id;
//END -> DO NOT REMOVE
output.Department = input.Department;
output.Email = input.Email_Address;
output.First_Name = input.First_Name;
output.LastName = input.Last_Name;
----
+
. Save and run the project as a Mule Application.

== Filtering Query Results

When executing queries using the Siebel Integration Object, you have a few options on how to filter the results http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E14004_01/books/EAI2/EAI2_UseEAIAdapt5.html[Siebel Query Method].

One way is to modify the property set given as input to the query and change the value of the fields that enter your search criteria with a Siebel expression in order to filter the results.

Another way is to use the "searchspec" field in the business object you wish to filter. In order to guarantee the records are filtered correctly, no other business object field should be used alongside the searchspec field.

== Managing the Connection Pool

To define the pooling profile for the connector manually, access the Pooling Profile tab in the applicable global element for the connector.

For background information on pooling, see xref:3.9@mule-runtime::tuning-performance.adoc[Tuning Performance].

== Example Code

For the example use case code to work in Anypoint Studio, you must provide the credentials for both Siebel and Salesforce accounts. You can either replace the variables with their values in the code, or you can add a file named mule.properties in the src/main/properties folder to provide values for each variable.

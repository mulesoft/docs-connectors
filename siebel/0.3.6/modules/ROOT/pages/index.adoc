_Premium_

Anypoint Connector for Siebel lets you access connections between Mule integration applications and the Oracle Siebel customer relationship manager (CRM).

*Release Notes*: xref:release-notes::connector/siebel-connector-release-notes.adoc[Siebel Connector Release Notes]

The connector provides these options to connect to Siebel applications:

* *Oracle Siebel Business Objects*: Create, update, upsert, query, and delete Siebel business components.
* *Oracle Siebel Integration Objects*: Create, update, upsert, query, delete, query page, execute, and synchronize Siebel integration objects.
* *Oracle Siebel Business Services*: Execute Siebel business services.

== Prerequisites

Because of how closely the connector is coupled with Siebel CRM, this document assumes you have a working knowledge of Siebel Business Components, Business Objects, Business Services, and Integration Objects.

This document assumes you are familiar with Mule, xref:3.6@mule-runtime::anypoint-connectors.adoc[Anypoint Connectors] , and xref:6@studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio Essentials] To increase your familiarity with Studio, consider completing one or more xref:6@studio::basic-studio-tutorial.adoc[Anypoint Studio Tutorials]. Further, this page assumes that you have a basic understanding of  xref:3.6@mule-runtime::elements-in-a-mule-flow.adoc[Mule flows] and xref:3.6@mule-runtime::global-elements.adoc[Mule Global Elements].

The Siebel connector requires the following two Siebel JAR files: `Siebel.jar` and `SiebelJI_xxx.jar`.

[NOTE]
Choose the `SiebelJI_xxx.jar` based on the locale of the Siebel installation. For instance, if the locale of Siebel installation is US_EN, use `SiebelJI_enu.jar`.

The `Siebel.jar` and `SiebelJI_enu.jar` are available in the  `<%SIEBEL_HOME%>\8.1\Tools_1\CLASSES` folder on the Siebel server.  `%SIEBEL_HOME%` is the installation directory of Siebel.

[NOTE]
You can add the JAR files to your Studio project while configuring the Siebel global element. Learn how to configure the Siebel connector global element.

== Compatibility

The Siebel connector is compatible with:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Application/Service |Version
|*Mule Runtime* |3.6.1 or higher
|*Siebel* |v8.1
|===

[WARNING]
The Siebel v2.1.0 connector is built and tested using Oracle Siebel 8.1. Because the Java Data Bean interface is generic, the Siebel v2.1.0 connector works with Siebel versions 7.7, 7.8, and 8.0. However, the compatibility of the connector with any other version beside 8.1 has not been tested. The connector is not compatible with Siebel v7.5 and below.

== Siebel Connector Architecture

The Siebel connector is built using the Siebel Java Data Beans interface. Java Data Beans provides a native Java interface to access the Siebel Object Manager.

The Siebel Object Manager lets a connector use a generic interface that doesn’t depend on a customized installation. To discover the metadata of Siebel objects in design time, use xref:3.6@mule-runtime::datasense.adoc[DataSense] in Anypoint Studio. The Siebel connector takes advantage of the Siebel Repository to show a list of available objects as well as their structures in a Siebel custom installation.

The objects can be business components, business objects, integration objects, or business services based on the connector option you configure.

Following is the integration architecture of the Anypoint Connector for Siebel:

== Installing and Configuring

=== Installing

You can install a connector in Anypoint Studio using the instructions in xref:3.7@mule-runtime::installing-connectors.adoc[To Install a Connector from Anypoint Exchange].

To use the Siebel connector in a production environment, you must have either:

* An Enterprise license to use Mule
* A CloudHub Starter, Professional, or Enterprise account

Contact the mailto:info@mulesoft.com[MuleSoft Sales Team] to arrange for either license. See also xref:3.6@mule-runtime::installing-an-enterprise-license.adoc[Installing an Enterprise License].

Studio displays three new connectors in the palette:

* *Oracle Siebel Business Objects*: Connects to Siebel business objects and components.
* *Oracle Siebel Business Services*: Connects to Siebel business services.
* *Oracle Siebel Integration Objects*: Connects to Siebel integration objects.

=== Creating a New Project

To use the Siebel connector in a Mule application project:

. In Studio, select **File **>** New **>** Mule Project**.
+
image::ps-0001b-installing-new.png[PS_0001B_installing_new]

. Enter a name for your new project and leave the remaining options with their default values. +
+
image::new-project-1.png[New+Project-1]

. If you plan to use Git, select **Create a .gitignore file** for the project with default ignores for Studio Projects, and then click *Next*.
. Click *Finish* to create the project.

== Configuring the Siebel Global Element

To use the Siebel connector in your Mule application, you must configure a global element for each of the following Siebel business layers:

* Business Objects
* Business Services
* Integration Objects

=== Siebel Connector and DataSense

[NOTE]
====
If you intend to use a Siebel connector in conjunction with a xref:6@studio::datamapper-user-guide-and-reference.adoc[DataMapper transformer] to map and transform data, you can make use of Anypoint Studio's xref:3.6@mule-runtime::datasense.adoc[DataSense] functionality. You can enable DataSense as part of configuring the global element.

* Follow the DataSense instructions to drop the transformer into your flow, then xref:3.6@mule-runtime::testing-connections.adoc[test the connection] to Siebel using the Siebel connector.
* For a more DataMapper-friendly experience, use the *XML Version* to select **XML Version 2 (DataMapper)**.
* Add a *DataMapper* to your flow, before or after the Siebel connector, and click the DataMapper transformer to display the DataMapper properties editor. Having collected metadata from Siebel, Mule automatically prescribes the input or output (relative to the position of the Siebel connector to DataMapper) to map and transform data.
* Define specific mappings to or from Siebel, then save your flow.

== Using the Connector

Siebel connector is a operation based connector, which means that when you add a Siebel connector to your flow, you need to configure a specific operation for the connector to perform.

=== Use cases

The following are the common use cases for the Siebel connector:

* Poll a Siebel connector at a regular interval for new registries and send the output into Salesforce.
* Poll a Salesforce connector at a regular interval for new registries and send the output into Siebel.

=== Adding the Oracle Siebel Business Objects Connector to a Flow

. Create a new Mule project in Anypoint Studio.
. Add a suitable Mule Inbound endpoint, such as the HTTP listener or File endpoint, to begin the flow.
. Drag the** **business objects connector onto the canvas, then select it to open the properties editor.
. Configure the connector's parameters according to the table below.

== Example Use Case 1

Poll a Siebel connector at a regular interval, looking for new registries, and send the output into Salesforce.

[NOTE]
Refer to documentation on the xref:3.6@mule-runtime::poll-reference.adoc[Poll Scope] , xref:6@studio::datamapper-user-guide-and-reference.adoc[DataMapper], and the xref:3.6@mule-runtime::salesforce-connector.adoc[Salesforce connector] for in-depth information about these Mule elements.

=== Studio Visual Editor

image::example-use-case.jpg[example+use+case]

. Drag a *Poll Scope* into a new flow.
+
image::poll2.jpg[]
+
xref:3.6@mule-runtime::poll-reference.adoc[Poll Scope] executes any Mule element you place inside it, at regular intervals. In this case, it is a Siebel endpoint.
. Configure the Poll Scope as follows
+
image::pollnew.jpg[]
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*Frequency* |60000
|*Start Delay* |0
|*Time Unit* |MILLISECONDS
|*Enable Watermark* |check
|*Variable Name* |lastUpdate
|*Default Expression* |`#[new org.joda.time.DateTime().withZone(org.joda.time.DateTimeZone.forID("PST8PDT")).minusSeconds(5).toString("MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss")]`
|*Update Expression* |`#[new org.joda.time.DateTime().withZone(org.joda.time.DateTimeZone.forID("PST8PDT")).minusSeconds(5).toString("MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss")]`
|===
+
The poll scope triggers once a minute. The watermark ensures that registries in the Siebel DB aren't processed more than once. It does this by keeping track of  the last element processed in the last poll.
+
[NOTE]
To learn how watermarks work and what each attribute is for, read about  xref:runtime-manager::managing-schedules.adoc[Poll Schedulers].
. Drag an *Oracle Siebel Business Objects* connector into the space provided by the Poll Scope. +
+
image::poll.jpg[]
+
The Siebel connector is now polled at the intervals you specified in the Poll Scope.
+
. Open Siebel connector's properties editor, and next to the Config Reference field, click the *+* sign to add a new *Global Element.*
+
image::boconfig.jpg[]

. On the Global Element Properties window, configure the global element according to the settings below:
+
image::config.jpg[]
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*Name* |Oracle_Siebel_Business_Object
|*User* |<Your Siebel user name>

|*Default View Mode* |3
|*Data Sense Filter Query* |[Name] = 'Action_IO' OR [Name] = 'Contact_IO'
|===
+
[WARNING]
DataSense is filtered via a query to extract data only from Contacts and Action. This aids better performance by avoiding unnecessary data extraction.
+
. Click *Test Connection* at the bottom of the window to ensure that everything is correctly configured.
. Next, configure the Oracle Siebel Business Objects connector according to the settings below:

|*View Mode* |3
|*fields-to-retrieve* |Create Object Manually
|*search-spec* |None
|*Operation* |Query business components
|===
+
*Note*: The search expression uses the same variable that is being updated by the Poll Scope. In this way, the Siebel connector returns only those DB records that Mule hasn't processed in the last poll.

            </siebel:query-business-components>
----

+
In between the start and end tags of the  `siebel:query-business-components` , add the following child element structure:

== Example Use Case 2

Poll a Salesforce connector for new registries at a regular interval and send the output into Siebel.

[NOTE]
Refer to documentation on the xref:3.6@mule-runtime::poll-reference.adoc[Poll Scope], xref:6@studio::datamapper-user-guide-and-reference.adoc[DataMapper], and the xref:3.6@mule-runtime::salesforce-connector.adoc[Salesforce Connector] for in depth information about these elements.

[.ex]
=====
[discrete.view]
=== Studio Visual Editor

image::example-use-case2.jpg[example+use+case2]

. Drag a *Poll Scope*  into a new flow: +
+
image::poll2.jpg[]
+
xref:3.6@mule-runtime::poll-reference.adoc[Poll Scope]  executes the Mule element placed inside it at regular intervals. In this case, it is a Salesforce connector.
+
. Configure the Poll Scope according to the settings below: +
+
image::pollnew.jpg[]
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*Frequency* |60000
|*Start Delay* |0
|*Time Unit* |MILLISECONDS
|*Enable Watermark* |check
|*Variable Name* |lastUpdateSalesforce
|*Default Expression* |`#[org.joda.time.format.ISODateTimeFormat.dateTime().print(new org.joda.time.DateTime().withZone(org.joda.time.DateTimeZone.forID("PST8PDT")).minusSeconds(5))]`
|*Update Expression* |`#[org.joda.time.format.ISODateTimeFormat.dateTime().print(new org.joda.time.DateTime().withZone(org.joda.time.DateTimeZone.forID("PST8PDT")).minusSeconds(5))]`
|===
+
The poll scope now triggers once a minute. The watermark ensures that registries in the Salesforce aren't processed more than once. It does this by keeping track of  the last element processed in the last poll.
+
[NOTE]
To learn how watermarks work and what each attribute is for, read about xref:runtime-manager::managing-schedules.adoc[Poll Schedulers]
. Drag a *Salesforce Connector* into the space inside the Poll Scope. +
+
image::poll3.jpg[]
+
The Salesforce connector is polled at the intervals you specify in the Poll Scope
+

. Open the *Properties* editor of the Salesforce connector and click the *+* sign to add a new Salesforce global element**.**
+
*image:sf12.jpg[]*

.  On the Choose Global Type window, click ***Salesforce: Basic authentication***, and then click *Ok*.
+
image::sfbasicauth.jpg[]
+

. Configure the Salesforce global element properties:
+
image::salesconfig.jpg[Salesconfig]
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*Name* |Salesforce
|*User* |<Your user name>
|*Password* |<Your password>
|*Port* |<Port you're using>
|*URL* |<URL of your Salesforce repository>
|*Enable DataSense* |check
|===
. Click *Test Connection* to ensure that everything is correctly configured.
. Configure the Salesforce connector according to the settings below:
+
image::sf22.jpg[]
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*Display Name* |Salesforce
|*Coding Reference* |Salesforce
|*Operation* |Query
|*Language* |Native Query Language
|*Query Text* |`SELECT Id, email, firstname, lastname from Contact WHERE LastModifiedDate >#[flowVars.lastUpdateSalesforce]`
|===
+
*Note*: The search expression uses the same variable that is being updated by the Poll Scope. In this way, the Salesforce connector only returns the DB records that Mule hasn't processed in the last poll to avoid redundancies.
. Drag a *Logger* right after the Poll Scope, it registers the output of the Poll.
+
image::sftolog.jpg[]
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*Message* |`From SFDC: #[payload]`
|*Level* |Info
|===
. Drag an *Oracle Siebel Integration Object* after the Logger. It uploads the output of the poll into your Siebel repository. +
+
image::logger-to-oracle.jpg[logger+to+oracle]
+
. Open the *Properties* editor of the Siebel connector and click the *+* sign to add a new *Global Element*:
+
image::io21.jpg[]
. Configure the global element according to the settings below
+
image::globalprop1.jpg[]
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*Name* |Oracle_Siebel_Integration_Object
|*Username* |<Your user name>

|*Object Manager* |<The object manager you use>
|*Enable DataSense* |check
|*Default View Mode* |3
|*Data Sense Filter Query* |`[Name] = 'Action_IO' OR [Name] = 'Contact_IO'`
|===
. Click *Test Connection* to ensure that everything is correctly configured.
. Configure the Siebel connector as follows
+
image::io22.jpg[]
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*Display Name* |Oracle Siebel Integration Object
|*Coding Reference* |Oracle_Siebel_Integration_Object
|*Operation* |Execute Siebel Adapter
|*Integration Object* |Contact IO
|*Method* |UPSERT
|*input-properties* |From Message:  `#[payload]`
|===
. Add a  *Data Mapper* element between the Logger and the Siebel connector. It maps fields from the data structure returned by Salesforce into the data structure required by Siebel. +
+
image::flow-io.jpg[flow+IO]

. Configure the *Data Mapper* element:
+
Input:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*Type* |Connector
|*Connector* |Salesforce
|*By Type* |check
|*List* |check
|*Object* |Contact
|===
+
Output:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*Connector* |Oracle_Siebel_Integration_Object
|*Operation* |execute-siebel-adapter
|*Object* |Contact IO
|===
+
[TIP]
If DataSense works correctly, DataMapper should be able to populate all of the output fields on its own
. Click *Create mapping* for the DataMapper to build a mapping between both the data structures.
. A few fields don't have the same names in Salesforce and Siebel. You must configure them manually.
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|Email_Address |Email
|First_Name |FirstName
|Last_Name |LastName
|Person_UId |Id
|===
+
Also, Siebel requires two fields that don't exist in Salesforce. You must provide some default values for these. You can set the variables to use the following default values:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Variable |Value
|Primary_Organization |Default Organization
|Personal_Contact |N
|===
+
There are two ways you can link these:
+

.. Look for the fields on both the columns in** DataLoader's graphical view**, then simply drag and drop one onto the other.
+
[TIP]
This is usually the easiest way to go, but given the number of fields to navigate, it may be hard to find the fields you need. Use the search box above the field list to find these quickly.
.. Enter *DataLoader's Script view* and paste the following lines of code below what is already written:
+

[source,text,linenums]
----
output.First_Name = input.FirstName;
output.Last_Name = input.LastName;
output.Email_Address = input.Email;
output.Person_UId = input.Id;
output.Primary_Organization = 'Default Organization';
output.Personal_Contact = 'N';
----
+

The full code should look like this:
+

[source,text,linenums]

//MEL
//START -> DO NOT REMOVE

output.Email_Address = input.Email;
output.Person_UId = input.Id;
output.Primary_Organization = 'Default Organization';
output.Personal_Contact = 'N';

= Oracle Siebel Connector 4.0 - Mule 4

Support Category: https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#anypoint-connectors[Premium]

Anypoint Connector for Oracle Siebel (Siebel Connector) lets you access connections between Mule runtime engine (Mule) integration apps and the Oracle Siebel customer relationship manager (CRM).

Siebel Connector has only one option for connecting with Siebel apps, which are categorized by Siebel Objects and Services.

* Oracle Siebel Business Objects: Create, update, upsert, query, and delete Siebel business components.
* Oracle Siebel Integration Objects: Create, update, upsert, query, delete, query page, execute, and synchronize Siebel integration objects.
* Oracle Siebel Business Services: Execute Siebel business services.

All options are available after installing the Siebel connector.

The Siebel connector is built using the Siebel Java Data Beans interface. Java Data Beans provides a native Java interface to access the Siebel Object Manager.

The Siebel Object Manager lets a connector use a generic interface that does not depend on a customized installation. To discover the metadata of Siebel objects in design time, use DataSense in Anypoint Studio. The Siebel connector takes advantage of the Siebel Repository to show a list of available objects as well as their structures in a Siebel custom installation.

The objects can be business components, business objects, integration objects, or business services.

== Prerequisites

To use this information, you should be familiar with Oracle Siebel, Mule runtime engine (Mule), Anypoint Connectors, Anypoint Studio, Mule concepts, elements in a Mule flow, and Global Elements.

You need login credentials to test your connection to your target resource.

To use this connector with Maven, view the pom.xml dependency information in
the Dependency Snippets in Anypoint Exchange.

Because of how closely the connector is coupled with Siebel CRM, you should have a working knowledge of Siebel Business Components, Business Objects, Business Services, and Integration Objects.

The Siebel connector requires the following two Siebel JAR files: `Siebel.jar` and `SiebelJI_xxx`.

Choose the SiebelJI_xxx.jar based on the locale of the Siebel installation. For instance, if the locale of Siebel installation is US_EN, use `SiebelJI_enu.jar`.
The `Siebel.jar` and `SiebelJI_enu.jar` are available in the `<%SIEBEL_HOME%>\8.1.1.11\Tools_1\CLASSES` folder on the Siebel server.  `%SIEBEL_HOME%` is the installation directory of Siebel.

The connector now is a conglomerate of the previous 3 modules (Oracle Siebel Business Objects, Oracle Siebel Integration Objects, Oracle Siebel Business Services)

Limit the number of objects to retrieve through DataSense to a few objects using search specifications, otherwise retrieving metadata slows down Studio.

[[log-requests-responses]]
== Log Requests and Responses

To log requests and responses when using the connector, configure a logger by adding this line to the `Loggers` element of the `log4j2.xml` configuration file for the Mule app:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<AsyncLogger name="org.mule.modules.siebel.internal.service"
   level="DEBUG"/>
----

The following example shows the `Loggers` element with the `AsyncLogger` line added:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Configuration status="WARN">
	<Appenders>
	    <Console name="Console" target="SYSTEM_OUT">
	    	<PatternLayout pattern="%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%t] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n"/>
		</Console>
	</Appenders>
	<Loggers>
		<AsyncLogger name="org.mule.modules.siebel.internal.service" level="DEBUG" additivity="false">
			<appender-ref ref="Console" level="debug"/>
		</AsyncLogger>
	</Loggers>
</Configuration>
----

You can view the app log as follows:

* If you’re running the app from the Anypoint Platform, the output is visible in the Anypoint Studio console window.

* If you’re running the app using Mule from the command line, the app log is visible in your OS console.

Unless the log file path was customized in the app’s log file (`log4j2.xml`), you can also view the app log in this default location:

`MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`

For more information about the app log, see xref:mule-runtime::logging-in-mule.adoc[Configuring Logging].

== Use Case: Studio

The Siebel Connector is an operation-based connector,
which means that when you add the connector to your flow you must specify an operation to perform.

=== Example Use Cases

The following are common use cases for the Siebel v4.0.0 connector:

. Create a Business Component (Action, Account, etc.)

.. Create a new Mule project in Anypoint Studio.
.. Add a suitable Mule Inbound endpoint, such as the HTTP listener, to begin the flow.
.. Drag the Create business component operation from the Siebel JDB palette onto the canvas, then select it to open the properties editor.
.. Configure the operation's parameters:
+
image::siebel-studio-create.png[Configure the operation's parameters]

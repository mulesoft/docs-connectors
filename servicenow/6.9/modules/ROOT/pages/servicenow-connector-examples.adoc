= ServiceNow Connector 6.9 Examples - Mule 4

To fully benefit from using Anypoint Connector for ServiceNow (ServiceNow Connector), see the following examples of configuring the connector both in Anypoint Studio and Flow Designer.

== Retrieve a ServiceNow Incident Record

This example creates a Mule flow in Flow Designer to retrieve a record based on an incident number:

. Create a Mule application as a project in Flow Designer.
. Add and configure an HTTP *Listener* as a source for your flow, and set the *Path* to `/incident/get`.

+
Or, use the default configuration for the HTTP Listener connection.

. Add the ServiceNow *Invoke* operation to your flow.
. Set up and test a ServiceNow configuration for the connection to the ServiceNow server, for example:
+
** Configuration Name: `ServiceNow_Config`
** Username: `my_user_name`
** Password: `my_password`
** Service Address: `+https://my_account.service-now.com+`
** ServiceNow Version: `Quebec`
+

[IMPORTANT]
Your ServiceNow account must either have the `soap` role set or be an `admin` account. Admin accounts automatically have access to SOAP and are preferred for testing. However, for production, create a dedicated API account with the `soap` role and any additional roles set to grant minimal necessary access.

+
If the connection test is unsuccessful, correct any invalid connection parameters and retest the connection.

. In the *Transport* tab for the ServiceNow configuration, set up, test, and save a `Basic Auth HTTP` Message Dispatcher.
+
Use the same username and password that you provided in the *General* tab, for example:
+
** Username: `my_user_name`
** Password: `my_password`
+
If the connection test is unsuccessful, correct any invalid connection parameters and retest the connection.

. Select the Web Service Configuration values for the ServiceNow connector, for example:
+
====
* Service: `incident`
* Operation: `getRecords`
====

. Make these values available as menu items in the *Service* and *Operation* fields.
+
====
The names become available once the connector loads the metadata for them. +

IMPORTANT: Do not add these names manually.
====
+
. Provide a transformation script for the connector.
. From the *Invoke* operation in Design Center, click  *Map* for the *Body* field.
. Click the *Script* tab at the bottom of the *Body* window.
. Copy and paste in the transformation script as in this example:
+
----
%dw 2.0
output application/xml
ns inc http://www.service-now.com/incident
---
{
    inc#getRecords: {
        inc#number: "INC0012345"
    }
}
----
+
NOTE: This example changes the `output` data type to `application/xml`.

. Add a Logger to the end of your flow that takes `payload` as the message.
. Deploy, sync, or run the app.
. Test the app by opening the URL `+http://url.for.your.app:8081/incident/get+` from a browser  or from an app such as Postman.
+
The response should look similar to this example (several fields omitted for brevity):

----
<getRecordsResponse xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">

  </getRecordsResult>
</getRecordsResponse>

== Retrieve Records from a ServiceNow Incident Table

This example creates a Mule flow in Studio to retrieve records from the `Incident` table. The following screenshot shows the Studio app flow for this example:

.App flow for the Retrieve Records example
image::servicenow-flow-incident-getrecords.png[Servicenow flow - incident get records]

. Create a Mule project in Studio.
. Add and configure an *HTTP Listener* trigger for your flow with this path:
+
====
`getrecords`
====
image::servicenow-listener.png[HTTP Listener general settings with path set to getrecords]
+
. Add a *Transform Message* component after the HTTP connector and provide a transformation script similar to this:
+
----
%dw 2.0
output application/xml
ns ns0 http://www.service-now.com/incident
---
{
	ns0#getRecords: {
		ns0#description: 'Test WSDL QA'
	}
}
----
+
NOTE: Add a description that matches records in your ServiceNow incident table.

. Add the *Invoke* operation from ServiceNow after the *Transform* component.

. Set up, test, and save a ServiceNow configuration for the connection to the ServiceNow server. If the connection is unsuccessful, correct any invalid connection parameters, and test again.
+
image::servicenow-studio-connection-6.6.0.png[Servicenow studio connection]
+
image::servicenow-studio-config-transport-tab.png[Servicenow studio config transport tab]
+
. In the *General* tab in the navigation, set *Service* to `incident` and *Operation* to `getRecords`. +
. Optionally, choose *Show Reference Values* from the values (`ALL`, `TRUE`, `FALSE`) +
+
IMPORTANT: In Studio 7.5.0 and later, you can choose the `service` and `operation` keys without specifying the `Show Reference Values` key to resolve the metadata. However, in earlier Studio versions, metadata wonâ€™t be loaded until you specify all of the metadata keys, and if you don't specify all of the metadata keys, it results in a tooling exception.
+
image::servicenow-metadata-without-reference-values.png[Servicenow metadata for Studio 7.5.0 without reference values]
+
. Set the Message Body to `payload`. +

. Add the *Transform Message* component to `transform XML to JSON` for better readability. For example:
+
----
%dw 2.0
output application/json
---
payload

----
+
. Add a *Logger* component to the end of your flow that takes a `payload` (or `#[payload]`) as the message. +
. Deploy or run your app.
. Test the app by navigating to `+http://localhost:8081/getrecords+` +

The response should look similar to this example (several fields are omitted for brevity):

== Retrieve ServiceNow Incident Table Keys

This example creates a Mule flow in Studio to retrieve keys from the Incident table in a ServiceNow instance:

. Create a Mule application as a project in Studio. +

. Add and configure an HTTP *Listener* trigger for your flow, and set the *Path* to `/getkeys`.

+
+
. Add a *Transform Message* component after the HTTP *Listener* operation.

. Provide a transformation script similar to this (use a description that matches records in your ServiceNow incident table):

+
----
%dw 2.0
output application/xml
ns ns0 http://www.service-now.com/incident
---
{
	ns0#getKeys: {
		ns0#description: 'Test WSDL QA'
	}
}
----
+
. Add the ServiceNow *Invoke* operation after the *Transform Message* component. +

. Set up, test, and save a ServiceNow configuration for the connection to the ServiceNow server. If the connection is unsuccessful, correct any invalid connection parameters and test again. +

. In the *General* tab navigation, set *Service* to `incident` and *Operation* to `getKeys`. +

. Set the Message Body to `payload`. +

. Add the *Transform Message* component to transform XML to JSON for better readability. For example:

+
----
%dw 2.0
output application/json
---
payload
----
+
. Add a *Logger* component to the end of your flow that takes a `payload` (or `#[payload]`) as the message.

. Deploy or run your app.

. To test the app, navigate to: `+http://localhost:8081/getkeys+`

. The response should look similar to this:
+
----
{
  "headers": {

  },
  "attachments": {

  },
  "body": {
    "getKeysResponse": {
      "sys_id": "c03deab4db840010a0e6e04a48961999,0f517ab8db840010a0e6e04a489619bc,6f1236f8db840010a0e6e04a489619f5",
      "count": "3"
    }
  }
}

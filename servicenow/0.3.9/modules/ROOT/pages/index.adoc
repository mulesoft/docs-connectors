ServiceNow Connector v5.x

The ServiceNow Connector facilitates connections between Mule integration and ServiceNow applications. The ServiceNow Connector v5 provides these operations: aggregate, deleteMultiple, deleteRecord, get, getKeys, getRecords, insert, insertMultiple, and update. You can use these operations with the custom ServiceNow tables, along with any operations available through the installed plugins.

The XML element for the ServiceNow configuration starts with the `servicenow:` statement.

*Migration Guide*: 

== About Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule, xref:3.9@mule-runtime::anypoint-connectors.adoc[Anypoint Connectors], and the xref:6@studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio interface]. To increase your familiarity with Studio, consider completing one or more xref:6@studio::basic-studio-tutorial.adoc[Anypoint Studio Tutorials]. Further, this page assumes that you have a basic understanding of xref:3.9@mule-runtime::mule-concepts.adoc[Mule flows] and xref:3.9@mule-runtime::global-elements.adoc[Global Elements in Mule].

For this connector to discover available operations, your ServiceNow user account has to have at least read access for the Name and Label fields in the sys_db_object and sys_db_view tables.

The ServiceNow API relies on HTTP Basic authentication which is the default authentication system to make an HTTP request.

== About Compatibility

This version of the ServiceNow connector is compatible with:

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|Application/Service
|Version
|Mule Runtime |3.7.0 or later
|ServiceNow |Eureka, Fuji, Geneva, Helsinki, and Istanbul (default)
|===

The ServiceNow connector has been tested with the Eureka,
Fuji, Geneva, Helsinki, and Istanbul (default) versions of ServiceNow.
It may work with other versions of ServiceNow as well, but the compatibility of the connector with another version has not been tested.

The ServiceNow connector is not compatible with Mule Runtime versions prior to 3.7.

== To Install this Connector

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio taskbar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange.
. Search for the connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

When Studio has an update, a message displays in the lower right corner, which you can click to install the update.

To use the ServiceNow connector v5 in a production environment, you must have an Enterprise license to use Mule. Contact the mailto:info@mulesoft.com[MuleSoft Sales Team] to obtain this license. See: xref:3.9@mule-runtime::installing-an-enterprise-license.adoc[Installing an Enterprise License].

== To Create a New Project

To use the ServiceNow connector in a Mule application project:

. In Studio, click File > New > Mule Project.
. Enter a name for your new project and leave the remaining options with their default values.
. If you plan to use Git, select Create a .gitignore File for the project with default ignore settings for Studio Projects, and click Next.
. Click Finish to create the project.
. Search for `http` and drag the HTTP connector to the canvas.
. Click the green plus sign next to Connector Configuration and accept the default settings for the HTTP connector.
. Search for `servicenow` and drag the ServiceNow connector to the canvas.
. Click the green plus sign next to Connector Configuration and choose either the <<snobasic,basic>> or <<snoadv,advanced>> configuration.

[[snobasic]]
== To Configure a ServiceNow Basic Configuration

The Basic configuration only supports basic authentication. You can specify ServiceNow login credentials from this menu:

image::servicenow-config.png[]

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|Name |Enter a name for the configuration so it can be referenced later.
|Username |Username for connecting to the ServiceNow instance.
|Password |Password to log into the ServiceNow instance.
|Service Address |The URL of your ServiceNow address, for example: `+https://myservicenow.service-now.com+`
|ServiceNow Version |Select the version of your ServiceNow instance. The default is ISTANBUL.
|User Table List |
* Default &mdash; DataSense does not fetch user (or custom) tables.
* Create Object Manually &mdash; Click the `...` symbol to add entries to the list. Only user (or custom) tables can be acquired by DataSense. In Object Builder, click the green plus sign to add a String entry. Right-click the entry to edit the metadata value for the entry (the Entry name cannot be changed).
|===

[[tblnotes]]
*Notes:*

* ServiceNow lets you create Custom Tables or Views. To access these, use the User Table List field.

* To fetch available tables and view, make a call to `/api/now/table/sys_db_object` and `/api/now/table/sys_db_view`, otherwise, the connector won't be able to display available operations and input/output parameters for them.
You can create a role with read writes on sys_db_object and sys_db_view, which can be limited to "name" and "label" fields as these are the ones of most interest, and associate those rules to your integration user without being forced to give admin rights to the integration user.

* The placeholder values refer to a configuration file placed in the `src` folder of your project. See xref:3.9@mule-runtime::configuring-properties.adoc[Learn how to configure properties]. You can either enter your credentials into the global configuration properties, or reference a configuration file that contains these values. For simpler maintenance and better re-usability of your project, use a configuration file. Keeping these values in a separate file is useful if you need to deploy to different environments, such as production, development, and QA, where your access credentials differ. See xref:3.9@mule-runtime::deploying-to-multiple-environments.adoc[Deploying to Multiple Environments] for instructions on how to manage this.

[[snoadv]]
== To Configure a ServiceNow Advanced Configuration

The Advanced configuration supports additional authentication options.

Using the advance configuration, connection settings like Connection Idle Timeout and Response Timeout can also be configured. You can configure them by modifying HTTP Request Configuration global element that you choose for HTTP Request Config.

The Advanced configuration requires that you specify ServiceNow login credentials from the HTTP connector. For information on each HTTP authentication parameter, see xref:3.9@mule-runtime::authentication-in-http-requests.adoc[Authentication in HTTP Requests].

[IMPORTANT]
While the ServiceNow Advanced Configuration exposes various configurations of HTTP Request, the connector only supports Basic Authentication, proxy setting, Connection Idle Timeout, and Response Timeout.

[[ex1]]
== Example 1: Get ServiceNow Incident Table Keys

Create a Mule flow to get keys from the Incident table in your ServiceNow instance.

See additional examples at the http://mulesoft.github.io/mule3-servicenow-connector/[ServiceNow connector resource page].

image::servicenow-73170.png[servicenow-getkeys-flow]

. Create a Mule project in your Anypoint Studio.
. Drag an HTTP connector into the canvas, then select it to open the properties editor console.
+
The HTTP Request configuration sets properties for the HTTP connection: socket properties, proxy settings, and authentication. This simple configuration assumes a default HTTP request configuration. If a different authentication strategy is employed, it can be configured within the advanced configuration of the connector.
+
. Add a new HTTP Listener Configuration global element:
.. In *Connector Configuration*, click the green plus button (*+*).
.. Accept the default parameters: port 8081 and host 0.0.0.0.
.. In the HTTP connector properties, set the path to the /get value.
. Add a Set Payload transformer after the HTTP connector, and set the value to `#[['description': 'Get Keys Demo']]`
. Search for `servicenow` and drag the ServiceNow connector after the Set Payload block.
. Click the green plus sign next to Connector Configuration, choose ServiceNow: Basic Configuration, and set the username, password, and service address to your ServiceNow access credentials.
. Click Validate Config to confirm that Mule can connect with your ServiceNow instance. If the connection is successful, click OK to save the configurations of the global element. If unsuccessful, revise or correct any incorrect parameters, and test again.
. In the properties editor of the ServiceNow connector, set the Table to Incident and the Operation to getKeys:
+
image::servicenow-getkeys-config.png[]
+
. Search for `dataweave` and drag the Transform Message processor between the Set Payload transformer and the ServiceNow connector, and configure it as follows:
+
image::servicenow-0547d.png[servicenow-dw-keys]
+
. The Output properties are automatically configured to correspond to the ServiceNow connector's input properties.
. Add an XML to JSON transformer.
. Save and run the project as a Mule Application.
. From a browser, navigate to `+http://0.0.0.0:8081/incident/get+`
. Mule performs the query to get keys from the Incident table and displays them in your browser.

For this code to work in Anypoint Studio, you must provide the credentials for your ServiceNow instance. You can either replace the variables with their values in the code, or you can add a file named `mule.properties` to the  `src/main/properties` folder to provide the values for each variable.

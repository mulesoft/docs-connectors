The ServiceNow Connector facilitates connections between Mule integration and ServiceNow applications. The ServiceNow Connector v5 allows you to perform seven standard operations (insert, update, get, getKeys, getRecords, deleteMultiple, deleteRecord) on standard as well as the custom ServiceNow tables, along with any operations available through the installed plugins.

*Release Notes*: xref:release-notes::connector/servicenow-connector-release-notes.adoc[ServiceNow Connector Release Notes].

*Migration Guide*: xref:servicenow-connector-5.0-migration-guide.adoc[ServiceNow Connector 5.x Migration Guide].

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule, xref:3.7@mule-runtime::anypoint-connectors.adoc[Anypoint Connectors], and the xref:5@studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio interface]. To increase your familiarity with Studio, consider completing one or more xref:5@studio::basic-studio-tutorial.adoc[Anypoint Studio Tutorials]. Further, this page assumes that you have a basic understanding of xref:3.7@mule-runtime::mule-concepts.adoc[Mule flows] and xref:3.7@mule-runtime::global-elements.adoc[Global Elements in Mule].

This document describes implementation examples within the context of Anypoint Studio, Mule ESB’s graphical user interface, and, also includes configuration details for doing the same in the XML Editor.

== Compatibility

The latest version of the ServiceNow connector, *presently v5.2.1 released March 2016*, is compatible with:

[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Application/Service
|Version
|Mule Runtime |3.7.0 or later
|ServiceNow |Eureka, Fuji and Geneva
|===

[NOTE]
The ServiceNow connector has been tested with the *Eureka, Fuji and Geneva versions of ServiceNow*. It may work with other versions of ServiceNow as well, but the compatibility of the connector with another version has not been tested. The connector is not compatible with Mule runtimes prior to 3.7.

== To Install this Connector

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio taskbar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange.
. Search for the connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

When Studio has an update, a message displays in the lower right corner, which you can click to install the update.

To use the ServiceNow connector v5 in a production environment, you must have an Enterprise license to use Mule. Contact the mailto:info@mulesoft.com[MuleSoft Sales Team] to obtain either of these. (Read more about xref:3.7@mule-runtime::installing-an-enterprise-license.adoc[Installing an Enterprise License].)

=== Creating a New Project

To use the ServiceNow connector in a Mule application project:

. In Studio, select File > New > Mule Project.
. Enter a name for your new project and leave the remaining options with their default values.
+
image::servicenow-new.png[servicenow_new]
+
. If you plan to use Git, select *Create a .gitignore file* for the project with default ignore settings for Studio Projects, and then click *Next*.
. Click *Finish* to create the project.

== Configuring the Global Element

To use the ServiceNow Connector in your Mule application, you must configure a global ServiceNow element that can be used by all the ServiceNow connectors in the application (read more about xref:3.7@mule-runtime::global-elements.adoc[global elements]). The ServiceNow connector supports a simple configuration and an advanced configuration.

ServiceNow API relies on *HTTP Basic authentication* which is the default authentication system to make an HTTP request. The HTTP Request configuration establishes various properties for the HTTP connection: socket properties, proxy settings and even various authentication mechanisms. This simple configuration assumes a default HTTP request configuration. If a different authentication strategy is employed, it can be configured within the advanced configuration of the connector.

=== Studio Visual Editor

Follow these steps to create a ServiceNow global element:

. Click the *Global Elements* tab at the base of the canvas.
. On the Global Mule Configuration Elements screen, click *Create*.
. In the Choose Global Type wizard, expand *Connector Configuration*, and click *ServiceNow: Advanced* or  *ServiceNow: Basic*, depending on your ServiceNow implementation.
+
image::servicenow-choose-global-type.png[]
+
. Click *OK*
. Enter the global element properties:
.. For *ServiceNow Connector: Basic Configuration*:
+

[%header,cols="2*a"]

|Field |Description
|*Name* |Enter a name for the configuration so it can be referenced later.
|*Username* |Username for connecting to the ServiceNow instance
|*Password* |Password to log into the ServiceNow instance
|*Service Address* |The URL of the ServiceNow instance.
Format: `https://<instancename>.service-now.com`
|*ServiceNow Version* |Select the version of your ServiceNow instance.
|*User Table List* |
* *None* - DataSense does not fetch any user tables.
* *Create Object manually* - A user creates a list and adds the table names to the list - only those user tables are acquired by DataSense.
|===
+
[NOTE]
In the image above, the placeholder values refer to a configuration file placed in the `src` folder of your project (xref:3.7@mule-runtime::configuring-properties.adoc[Learn how to configure properties]). You can either enter your credentials into the global configuration properties, or reference a configuration file that contains these values. For simpler maintenance and better re-usability of your project, Mule recommends that you use a configuration file. Keeping these values in a separate file is useful if you need to deploy to different environments, such as production, development, and QA, where your access credentials differ. See xref:3.7@mule-runtime::deploying-to-multiple-environments.adoc[Deploying to Multiple Environments] for instructions on how to manage this.

|===
+
image::servicenow-advanced-basic-auth.png[]
+
. Create the HTTP Request Config object. Provide the ServiceNow username and password in the Authentication tab after selecting "Basic" from the Protocol dropdown.
. Keep the default values in the *Pooling Profile* and the *Reconnection* tabs.
. Click *Validate Config* to confirm that the parameters of your global ServiceNow connector are accurate, and that Mule is able to successfully connect to your instance of ServiceNow. Read more about
xref:5@studio::testing-connections.adoc[Testing Connections].
. Click *OK* to save the global connector configurations.

=== XML Editor

To configure the ServiceNow global element:

.  Ensure you have included the following namespaces in your configuration file:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/servicenow
http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/servicenow/current/mule-servicenow.xsd

+
. Create a global ServiceNow configuration outside and above your flows, using the following global configuration code:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<servicenow:config name="ServiceNow_Connector__configuration" username="${servicenow.username}" password="${servicenow.password}" serviceAddress="${servicenow.serviceEndpoint}" doc:name="ServiceNow Connector: configuration">

== Using the Connector

ServiceNow connector is an operation-based connector, which means that when you add the connector to your flow, you need to configure a specific operation (Invoke operation) for the connector to perform. The XML element for the Invoke operation is  *servicenow-wsdl:invoke*. After you call the Invoke operation, you can use the "Table" and "Operation" fields to select a method you want to execute on a particular ServiceNow table. The ServiceNow connector v5 allows you to perform seven standard operations (insert, update, get, getKeys, getRecords, deleteMultiple, deleteRecord) on the standard as well as custom ServiceNow tables, along with any operations available through the installed plugins.

=== Use Cases

Below are a few common use cases for the ServiceNow connector:

* Get Records from the Incident table.
* Get Keys from the Incident table.
* Update Incident table using the new DataWeave Language.

==== Adding the ServiceNow Connector to a Flow

. Create a new Mule project in Anypoint Studio.
. Drag the ServiceNow Connector onto the canvas, then select it to open the properties editor.
. Configure the connector's parameters:
+
image::servicenow-getkeys-config.png[]
+
[cols="2*a"]
|===
|*Field* |*Description*
|*Display Name* |Enter a unique label for the connector in your application.
|*Connector Configuration* |Select a global ServiceNow connector element from the dropdown.
|*Operation* |Invoke
|*Table* |Select a ServiceNow table from the dropdown.
|*Operation* |Select the operation to perform on the table your select.
|===
+
. Save your configurations.

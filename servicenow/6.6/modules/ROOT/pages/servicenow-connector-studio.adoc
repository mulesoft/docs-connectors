= Using Anypoint Studio to Configure ServiceNow Connector - Mule 4


Studio editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.

To configure a connector in Anypoint Studio:

. Create a Mule project.
. Supply your authentication credentials to Anypoint Platform.
. Add the connector to your Mule project.
. Configure an input source for the connector's flow.
. Configure the connector.

== Best Practices

Follow these best practices when you configure an input source and connector in Studio:

* Configure an associated global element for the input source and connector.
* Create a YAML or properties file to contain your properties, and then reference the file from the configuration.
* Configure a reconnection strategy for the input source and target connector.


== Add the Connector to Your Project

Add ServiceNow Connector to a Mule project both to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location and to add the required dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file.

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Modules to Project*, type "servicenow" in the search field.
. Click the ServiceNow Connector name in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.

== Configure the Connector

The ServiceNow Connector supports Basic and OAuth2 authentications. Select the authorization type to use from the *Connection* drop-down list.

=== Basic Authentication

. In the ServiceNow Config *General* tab, select *Basic Authentication* from the *Connection* drop-down list.
. Provide the following values for Basic authentication:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|*Username* | Name used to log in to ServiceNow
|*Password* | Password that corresponds to the user name
|*Service Address* | The WSDL endpoint
|*ServiceNow Version* | The ServiceNow version to use
|*User table list*| Custom tables for a user who is logged in
|===

==== Basic Authentication HTTP Message Dispatcher Provider

. Click the *Transport* tab.
. From *Transport Configuration*, select *Basic auth http message dispatcher provider*.
. Enter the following required values:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|*User Name* | Name used to log in to ServiceNow
|*Password* | Password that corresponds to the user name
|===

==== Basic Authentication HTTP Requester Based Transport Provider

. Click the *Transport* tab.
. From *Transport Configuration*, select *Http requester based transport provider*.
. Select the *Requester config* or click the green plus sign to create a new one.

+
. Specify the required values:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|*Host* | The WSDL endpoint
|*Username* | User name for logging in to ServiceNow
|*Password* | Password that corresponds to the user name
|===

=== OAuth2.0 Authentication

. In the ServiceNow Config *General* tab, select *OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code* from the *Connection* drop-down list.
. Specify the values for the OAuth connection:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|*Service Address* | ServiceNow's instance endpoint.
|*Consumer key* | Client ID from the registered application.
|*Consumer secret* | Client secret from the registered application.
|*Authorization url* | Endpoint for initiating the OAuth dance.
|*Access token url* | Endpoint for retrieving the access token.
|*Listener config* | HTTP Listener configuration.
|*Callback path* | The path of the access token callback endpoint.
|*Authorize path* | The path of the local HTTP endpoint that triggers OAuth dance.
|*External callback url* | If the callback endpoint is behind a proxy  or should be accessed through a non-direct URL, use this parameter to specify the URL the OAuth provider should use to access the callback.
|===

== Configure an Input Source

Because ServiceNow operations can't be used as input sources, you must configure the input source by using an *HTTP Listener* or *Scheduler* component:

* *HTTP Listener* +
Start your app using a browser or a command such as `curl`.
* *Scheduler* +
Start your app at timed intervals.

In Studio, drag the input operation you choose from the *Mule Palette* to the canvas.

== Next Step

After configuring ServiceNow Connector in Studio, see the xref:servicenow-connector-examples.adoc[Examples] to experiment with the connector.

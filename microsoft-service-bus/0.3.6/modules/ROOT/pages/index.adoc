:keywords: anypoint studio, connector, endpoint, microsoft, azure, windows service bus, windows
:page-aliases: 3.6@mule-runtime::microsoft-service-bus-connector.adoc

The ServiceBus connector enables message integration with Windows Service Bus on premises and Azure Service Bus on the cloud. The connector supports communication with queues, topics and event hubs through AMQP 1.0. In addition, dynamic discovery and provisioning of Service Bus objects is possible using the built-in management API.

*Release Notes:* xref:release-notes::connector/microsoft-service-bus-connector-release-notes.adoc[Microsoft Windows Service Bus Connector Release Notes]

The connector currently supports the following operations:

* Send to Queues, Topics and Event Hubs with support of AMQP message properties and header, including custom properties.
* Receive from Queues and Topics asynchronously
* Rest Management API
* CRUD for Queues
* CRUD for Topics
* CRUD for Subscriptions
* CRUD for Rules

The connector supports the following Service Bus versions:

* Microsoft Azure Service Bus (Cloud)
* Microsoft Windows Service Bus (on-premises)

=== Running the Application

You are now ready to run the project! First, you can test run the application from Studio:

. Right-click your application in the Package Explorer pane.
. Select Run As > Mule Application:
. Start a browser and go to `+http://localhost:8081/servicebus+`.
. The list of existing queues should be returned in JSON format (results vary according to your Service Bus instance).


== Service Bus Authentication

For sending and receiving messages through the Service Bus connector, the authentication is performed through AMQP.

For the REST Management API, the authentication scheme differs based on the Microsoft Service Bus version. The Windows Service Bus running on premises uses OAuth and the Azure Service Bus running on the cloud uses a Shared Access Key token.

[NOTE]
The Windows Service Bus uses a self-signed SSL certificate to secure the communication via AMQP/HTTPS. The connector won’t run if this certificate is not locally imported in the box running Mule, unless the Ignore SSL warning check is enabled.

To enable the SSL checks, the certificate must be imported following these steps:

. Use the powershell cmdlet Get-SBAutoGeneratedCA to download the certificate locally in the box running the Windows Service Bus. For the purposes of this tutorial,  assume the certificate file is exported to `%temp%\AutoGeneratedCA.cer`.
. Go to `%programfiles%\Java\jre7`. Verify that the `bin\keytool.exe` tool exists, and that `lib\security\cacerts` exists. Note that you must be running as Administrator in order to perform a certificate import with Keytool.exe. Otherwise, an Access Denied error is generated.
. Enter the following command:*  bin\keytool.exe –list –keystore lib\security\cacerts.*
. Import the autogenerated Service Bus certificate by running the following command:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
bin\keytool.exe –importcert –alias AppServerGeneratedSBCA –file
%temp%\AutoGeneratedCA.cer –keystore lib\security\cacerts –v
----
+
. You are prompted for the password (the default is “changeit”).  If you do not know the password, you cannot perform the import.  When the tool asks you whether to trust the certificate, enter *Y* (Yes).

== AMQP Operations - Send to Queue Topic Event Hub


[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
|Property |Usage
|*Destination Queue/Topic/Event Hub* |The name of the destination of the message
|*Body* |The content of the message
|*Header* |The supported Header fields defined in the AMQP 1.0 standard
|*Properties* |The supported Amqp Properties defined in the AMQP 1.0 Standard
|===

The following message content types are supported by these operations : String, Stream, Map, Byte Array or any object that implements the serializable interface. An Exception is raised otherwise.

The Amqp Header fields defined in the AMQP 1.0 standard that can be specified in the processor are:

* *Durable*: specify durability requirements
* *Priority*: relative message priority
* *Ttl*: time to live in ms
* *deliveryCount*: the number of prior unsuccessful delivery attempts

The following Amqp Properties in the standard are supported and can be specified:

* *messageId*: application message identifier
* *contentType*: MIME content type
* *correlationId*: application correlation identifier
* *to*: the address of the node the message is destined for
* *replyTo*: the node to send replies to
* *userId*: creating user id
* *subject*: the subject of the message

*Custom Properties:*

Additional custom properties can be passed through the Mule Message properties to the processor. To do this, the property name of the Mule Message has to start with the “amqp.” prefix.


== AMQP Operations - Receive from Queue/Topic

[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
|Property |Usage
|*Source Topic/Queue* |The name of the source from where the messages is retrieved
|*Subscription* |In case of receiving messages from a topic, the name of the subscription from where the messages is retrieved has to be specified
|===

To use these operations, the connector has to be an inbound endpoint. The _Receive_ operations use asynchronous listeners to receive the messages. Once the message is received, the custom properties of the AMQP Message is transformed into Mule Message properties with the “amqp.” prefix, and the content of the message is passed as the payload.

== Management API

=== Queues

==== ServiceBusQueue Object

The queue is represented by an object containing the following fields:

* *Id* (String)
* *Title* (String)
* *Published* (Date)
* *Updated* (Date)
* *Author* (String)
* *Link* (String)
* *Queue Description* (ServiceBusQueueDescription)

==== ServiceBusQueueDescription Object

* *Lock Duration* (String): Determines the amount of time in seconds in which a message should be locked for processing by a receiver. After this period, the message is unlocked and available for consumption by the next receiver. Settable only at queue creation time.  +
 Valid values: Range: 0 – 5 minutes. 0 means that the message is not locked.  +
 Format: PTx3Mx4S , where x1 is number of days, x2 is number of hours, x3 is number of minutes, x4 is number of seconds (Examples: PT5M (5 minutes) , PT1M30S (1 minute, 30 seconds)). +
* *Max Size In Megabytes* (Long): Specifies the maximum queue size in megabytes. Any attempt to enqueue a message that  causes the queue to exceed this value will fail. Valid values are: 1024, 2048, 3072, 4096, 5120.
* *Size In Bytes* (Long): Reflects the actual number of bytes that messages in the queue currently occupy toward the queue’s quota.
* *Message Count* (Long): Displays the number of messages currently in the queue.

* *Dead Lettering On Message Expiration* (Boolean): This field controls how the Service Bus handles a message with an expired TTL. If it is enabled and a message expires, Service Bus moves the message from the queue into the queue’s dead-letter sub-queue. If disabled, message is permanently deleted from the queue. Settable only at queue creation time.
* *Enable Batched Operations* (Boolean): Enables or disables service-side batching behavior when performing operations for the specific queue. When enabled, Service Bus collects/batches multiple operations to the back end, to be more efficient with the connection. If you want lower operation latency, you can disable this feature.
* *Default Message Time To Live* (String): Depending on whether DeadLettering is enabled, a message is automatically moved to the DeadLetterQueue or deleted if it has been stored in the queue for longer than the specified time. This value is overwritten by a TTL specified on the message if and only if the message TTL is smaller than the TTL set on the queue. This value is immutable after the queue has been created.
* *Format*: Px1DTx2Hx3Mx4S , where x1 number of days, x2 number of hours, x3 number of minutes, x4 number of seconds (Examples: PT10M (10 minutes), P1DT2H (1 day, 2 hours)

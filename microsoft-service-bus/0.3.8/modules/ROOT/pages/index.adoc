== Service Bus Authentication

For sending and receiving messages through the Service Bus connector, the authentication is performed through AMQP.

For the REST Management API, the authentication scheme differs based on the Microsoft Service Bus version. The Windows Service Bus running on premises uses OAuth and the Azure Service Bus running on the cloud uses a Shared Access Key token.

[NOTE]
The Windows Service Bus uses a self-signed SSL certificate to secure the communication via AMQP and HTTPS. The connector won’t run if this certificate is not locally imported in the box running Mule, unless the *Ignore SSL* warning check is enabled.

To enable the SSL checks, the certificate must be imported following these steps:

. Use the powershell cmdlet https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/jj248762%28v=azure.10%29.aspx[Get-SBAutoGeneratedCA] to download the certificate locally in the box running the Windows Service Bus. For the purposes of this tutorial, assume the certificate file is exported to _%temp%\AutoGeneratedCA.cer_.
. Go to _%programfiles%\Java\jre7_. Verify that the _bin\keytool.exe_ tool exists, and that _lib\security\cacerts_ exists. Note that you must be running as Administrator in order to perform a certificate import with Keytool.exe. Otherwise, an Access Denied error is generated.
. Enter the following command: *bin\keytool.exe –list –keystore lib\security\cacerts*
. Import the auto-generated Service Bus certificate by running the following command:  *bin\keytool.exe –importcert –alias AppServerGeneratedSBCA –file %temp%\AutoGeneratedCA.cer –keystore lib\security\cacerts –v*
. You are prompted for the password (the default is “changeit”).  If you do not know the password, you cannot perform the import.  When the tool asks you whether to trust the certificate, enter *Y* (Yes).

=== SAS Based Authentication

In addition to the connection schemes that require a username and password, the connector provides a connection in which authentication is SAS based (only for Azure) which allows you to set the authentication token for the Service Bus Service without requiring the username and password for it.

As the SAS token schema is URI based (that is, you can assign different authorization access to your resources based on their URIs) the connection supports multiple ways of providing the authentication tokens needed. The most trivial and simple case is when you have a single profile that authorizes accesses to all your resources by using an specific root URI which is the base endpoint that your service expose. If you need to provide different access tokens on different resources, then you can use a setting that allows you to configure a list of them according to the resources the connector will need to access during its running time.

Last but not least, and extending the mechanisms described above to provide the authentication token, there is another mechanism that allows you to implement a custom token provider to allow the connector requests for security tokens when needed. It is your responsibility to solve each request and to return a fresh token every time the connector asks for one. As the token has an expiration time within it, this mechanism allows the connector to re-authenticate with the target resource once the token has expired (this is not allowed with the previous mechanisms described above where the tokens are fixed at configuration time before the flow runs).

The following are the available settings for the `Shared Access Signature` connection:

*Service Namespace*: The namespace for the Azure Service Bus Service within your subscription.

*Shared Access Signature*: (Optional) The unique security token when you set up just one security profile to access all your service resources. In this case when the token has expired, the connector cannot reconnect automatically and you will need to stop running the flow in order to update this configuration setting with a new token.

Within the advanced section you can find:

*SAS Tokens List*: (Optional) The list of security tokens the connector will need to access different URIs when the security profiles for each one of them are different. In this case when any of the tokens has expired the connector cannot reconnect to the URI linked to that token and you will need to stop running the flow in order to update this configuration setting with a new set of tokens.

*SAS Tokens Provider*: (Optional) An Spring bean reference implementing the `org.mule.modules.microsoftservicebus.connection.providers.SharedAccessSignatureProvider` interface. If you set an instance of a token provider here, it is your responsibility to provide a fresh token for each URI the connector requires access to (according to your security profiles). In this case each time a token has expired the connector will request for a new one, which will be provided by your implementation, and reconnection to the target URI will be done seamlessly. In order to provide a reference to your own implementation as a Spring bean, refer to the following xref:3.8@mule-runtime::using-spring-beans-as-flow-components.adoc[documentation].

NOTE: At least one of the optional settings shown above must be provided.

In all cases, the token format you should provide is a `string` that must comply with the following pattern:

----
SharedAccessSignature sr=[resource_uri]&sig=[signature]&se=[ttl]&skn=[profile]
----

the `sr` parameter value can start with `https` or `amqps` protocol depending on the operation you will perform on the target resource.

As example:
----
SharedAccessSignature sr=amqps%3a%2f%2fmynamespace.servicebus.windows.net%2fMyQueue&sig=pSrfJn5uRTiepgOTjBpjcf2gw%2bG34S1MYdCfkQkTC8A%3d&se=101&skn=OperationalPolicyKey`
----

==== Performance Considerations

The Claims Based Security mechanism required to authenticate to Azure Service Bus using a SAS token involves exchanging messages with a special node. The latest impacts on connector's performance as tokens are exchanged per request in order to achieve connection security setup using targeted tokens (related to the resource being accessed). This has been optimized, starting from version 1.2, to impact performance as low as possible. Anyway, if your scenario requires sending several messages with high throughput it is recommended the connection strategy that requires setting the username and password. This is the simpler way to authenticate to Azure Service Bus with the connector while achieving better throughput, though it requires to write the password for the `shared access key name` you are using.

NOTE: As said before, if you are experiencing performance issues when using the SAS strategy we recommend you updating to version 1.2 or higher. The optimized mechanism has lower performance impact on receiving & sending operations as the AMQP container and cache (respectively) keep the connection alive and token exchange messages occur only when setting up the connection and/or in case of token expiration.

==== Using restricted access policies

In cases where you have restrict access to your resources, having a security policy with permissions just at resource level, the connector cannot perform the `connectivity test` when it is starting up as this targets the root level of your namespace which might be forbidden due to the customized policy applied to the `shared access key`. For these scenarios, you need to skip the connectivity test with the configuration option available to this purpose, otherwise connetor's startup will fail.

== Connector Operations

=== AMQP Operations

==== Send to Queue, Topic, or Event Hub

[%header,cols="20,80"]
|===
|Property |Usage
|*Destination Queue, Topic, Event Hub* |The name of the destination of the message
|*Body* |The content of the message
|*Header* |The supported Header fields defined in the AMQP 1.0 standard
|*Properties* |The supported AMQP Properties defined in the AMQP 1.0 Standard
|===

The following message content types are supported by these operations: String, Stream, Map, Byte Array, or any object that implements the serializable interface. An exception is raised otherwise.

You can specify the following AMQP Header fields defined in the AMQP 1.0 standard in your processor:

* *Durable*: Specify durability requirements
* *Priority*: Relative message priority
* *Ttl*: Time to live in milliseconds
* *deliveryCount*: The number of prior unsuccessful delivery attempts

The following AMQP Properties in the standard are supported and can be specified:

* *messageId*: Application message identifier
* *contentType*: MIME content type
* *correlationId*: Application correlation identifier
* *to*: The address of the node the message is destined for
* *replyTo*: The node to send replies to
* *userId*: Creating a user ID
* *subject*: The subject of the message

*Custom Properties:*

Additional custom properties can be passed through the Mule Message properties to the processor. To do this, the property name of the Mule Message has to start with the “amqp.” prefix.

==== Receive from Queue or Topic

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Property |Usage
|*Source Topic, Queue* |The name of the source from where the messages is retrieved
|*Subscription* |In case of receiving messages from a topic, the name of the subscription from where the messages is retrieved has to be specified
|===

To use these operations, the connector has to be an inbound endpoint. The _Receive_ operations use asynchronous listeners to receive the messages. Once the message is received, the custom properties of the AMQP Message is transformed into Mule Message properties with the “amqp.” prefix, and the content of the message is passed as the payload.

== Management API

=== Queues

WebSockets Connector Version 1.0

Anypoint Connector for WebSockets (WebSockets Connector) provides communication through the WebSockets protocol, allowing external systems to open connections to the server (inbound sockets) or to establish connections to external systems (outbound socket). In both cases, full duplex traffic is supported.

== Operations

Anypoint Connector for WebSockets (WebSockets Connector) supports the following operations:

* <<Broadcast>>
* <<BulkCloseSockets>>
* <<CloseSocket>>
* <<OpenOutboundSocket>>
* <<Send>>

=== Associated Sources

* <<InboundListener>>

[[Broadcast]]
== Broadcast
`<websocket:broadcast>`

Sends the content to all active WebSockets that match the path, socketType, and groups criteria. In the case of the path, the configured base path is not considered, as you can target both inbound and outbound sockets.

The message is sent to all the matching sockets, even though it's possible that delivery to some of them fail. The operation returns a list of `BroadcastFailure` that contains details of each failure. If none fail, an empty list is returned.

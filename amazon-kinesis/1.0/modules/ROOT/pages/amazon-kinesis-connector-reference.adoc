== Configurations
---
[[Config]]
=== Config

The configuration for the connector. You can use this configuration for both the producer and consumer.

==== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x
| Connection a| <<Config_Connection, Kinesis Connection>> | The connection types to provide to this configuration. | | x
| Aggregation Enabled a| Boolean |  When set to `true`, this option packs multiple user data records into a single Amazon Kinesis data record. |  true |
| Response Timeout a| Number |  The maximum total time that can elapse between the start of an HTTP request and when the responses are received. If this time is exceeded, the request times out.|  30 |
| Request Timeout Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  A time unit that qualifies the *Response Timeout* value |  SECONDS |
| Record Max Buffered Time a| Number |  Maximum amount of time that an Amazon Kinesis data record spends buffering before it is sent. Records can be sent earlier than this value, depending on other buffering limits. |  3 |
| Record Max Buffered Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  A time unit that qualifies the *Record Max Buffered Time* value|  SECONDS |
| Aggregation Max Count a| Number |  Maximum number of items to pack into an aggregated Amazon Kinesis data record. |  4294967295 |
| Aggregation Max Size a| Number |  Maximum data size to pack into an aggregated Amazon Kinesis data record. |  51200 |
| Aggregation Max Size Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB |  A data unit that qualifies the *Aggregation Max Size* value |  BYTE |
| Collection Max Count a| Number |  Maximum number of items to pack into a batch request. |  500 |
| Collection Max Size a| Number |  Maximum amount of data to send with a *Put Record* operation. |  5242880 |
| Collection Max Size Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB |  A data unit that qualifies the *Collection Max Size* value |  BYTE |
| Connection Timeout a| Number |  The amount of time to wait when initially establishing the TCP connection between the connector and Amazon Kinesis server before throwing an exception if the connection fails |  30 |
| Connection Timeout Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  The time unit for the *Connection Timeout* value |  SECONDS |
| Max Connections a| Number |  Maximum number of connections to open to the backend. HTTP requests are sent in parallel over multiple connections. Setting this value too high can impact latency and consume additional resources without increasing throughput. |  24 |
| Min Connections a| Number |  Minimum number of connections to keep open to the backend. In most cases, there is no need to increase value. |  1 |
| Rate Limit a| Number |  Limits the number of data records per second and number of bytes per second sent to a shard. This limit can reduce bandwidth and CPU cycle wastage from sending requests that will fail from throttling. The default value, 150%, enables a single producer instance to completely saturate the allowance for a shard. To reduce throttling errors rather than completely saturate the shard, consider reducing this setting. |  150% |
| Record TTL a| Number | Time limit for data records to be put. Records that are not successfully put within this limit fail. When setting this value, take into consideration the fact that data records still incur network latency after they leave the Amazon Kinesis Producer Library (KPL). |  30 |
| Record TTL Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  The time unit for the *Record TTL* value. |  SECONDS |
| Thread Pool Size a| Number |  Maximum number of threads with which to configure the native process thread pool. The default value, 0, enables the KPL process to choose the size of the thread pool. |  0 |

==== Connection Types
[[Config_Basic]]
===== Basic Auth Connection Provider


====== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Default Headers a| Object |  Default HTTP headers to include in requests. |  |
| Query Parameters a| Object |  Default query parameters to include in requests. |  |
| Connection Timeout a| Number |  How long the connector waits before timing out when establishing a connection to the remote service.  |  30 |
| Connection Timeout Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** DAYS |  Time unit for the *Connection Timeout* field. |  SECONDS |
| Use Persistent Connections a| Boolean a|  Indicates whether to use persistent connections:

* `true`
+
Mule uses persistent connections.

* `false`
+
Mule closes the connection after the first request completes. |  true |
| Max Connections a| Number |  Maximum number of connections to open to the backend. HTTP requests are sent in parallel over multiple connections. Setting this value too high can impact latency and consume additional resources without increasing throughput. By default, the number of connections is unlimited. |  -1 |
| Connection Idle Timeout a| Number |  When persistent connections are enabled, how long a connection can remain idle before Mule closes it. The value of this attribute is used only when persistent connections are enabled.  |  30 |
| Connection Idle Timeout Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** HOURS
** DAYS |  Time unit for the *Connection Idle Timeout* field. |  SECONDS |
| Proxy Config a| <<Proxy>> |  Configures a proxy for outbound connections. A proxy element must define a host name and port attributes and can optionally define a username and a password. |  |
| Stream Response a| Boolean |  If this value is `true`, Mule streams received responses. Processing continues when all headers are parsed and the body is streamed. When enabled, the response must eventually be read because, depending on the configured buffer size, the response might not fit into the memory and processing will stop until space is available. |  false |
| Response Buffer Size a| Number |  Size of the buffer that stores the HTTP response, in bytes. |  -1 |
| Base Uri a| String |  Parameter base URI. Each instance or tenant gets its own parameter base URI. |  `+https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v2.0/<tenantId>/<environmentname>/api/v2.0+` |
| Username a| String |  Username used to authenticate the requests. |  | x
| Password a| String |  Password used to authenticate the requests. |  |
| Protocol a| Enumeration, one of:

** HTTP
** HTTPS |  Protocol to use for communication. If `HTTPS` is configured as a protocol, the user can customize the TLS/SSL configuration by defining the `tls:context` child element of this `listener-config`. If `tls:context` is not defined, then the default JVM certificates are used to establish communication. |  HTTP |
| TLS Configuration a| <<Tls>> |  Reference to a TLS config element. This field enables `HTTPS` for this config. |  |
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> a|  What to do if, when an app is deployed, a connectivity test does not pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy:

* `true`
+
Allow the deployment to fail.

* `false`
+
Ignore the results of the connectivity test. |  |

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | Initial amount of memory to allocate to the data stream. If the streamed data exceeds this value, the buffer expands by *Buffer Size Increment*, with an upper limit of *Max In Memory Size value*. |  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | Amount by which the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of `0` or lower specifies that the buffer can't expand. |  |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | The maximum amount of memory to use. If more than that is used then a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised. A value lower than or equal to zero means no limit. |  |

** MB
** GB | Unit for the *Initial Buffer Size*, *Buffer Size Increment*, and *Buffer Unit* fields. |  |
|===

[[RepeatableFileStoreStream]]
=== Repeatable File Store Stream

Configures the repeatable file-store streaming strategy by which Mule keeps a portion of the stream content in memory. If the stream content is larger than the configured buffer size, Mule backs up the buffer's content to disk and then clears the memory.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| In Memory Size a| Number a| Maximum amount of memory that the stream can use for data. If the amount of memory exceeds this value, Mule buffers the content to disk. To optimize performance:

* Configure a larger buffer size to avoid the number of times Mule needs to write the buffer on disk. This increases performance, but it also limits the number of concurrent requests your application can process, because it requires additional memory.

* Configure a smaller buffer size to decrease memory load at the expense of response time. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | Unit for the *In Memory Size* field. |  |
|===

=== Redelivery Policy

Configures the redelivery policy for executing requests that generate errors. You can add a redelivery policy to any source in a flow.

| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Redelivery Count a| Number | Maximum number of times that a redelivered request can be processed unsuccessfully before returning a REDELIVERY_EXHAUSTED error. |  |
| Message Digest Algorithm a| String | Secure hashing algorithm to use if the *Use Secure Hash* field is `true`. If the payload of the message is a Java object, Mule ignores this value and returns the value that the payload's `hashCode()` returned. |  |
| Message Identifier a| <<RedeliveryPolicyMessageIdentifier>> | One or more expressions that determine if a message was redelivered. This property can be set only if the *Use Secure Hash* field is `false`. |  |
| Object Store a| ObjectStore | Configures the object store that stores the redelivery counter for each message. |  |
|===

Configures how to identify a redelivered message and how to find out when the message was redelivered.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]

| Use Secure Hash a| Boolean | If `true`, Mule uses a secure hash algorithm to identify a redelivered message. |  |
| Id Expression a| String | One or more expressions that determine when a message was redelivered. You can set this property only if the *Use Secure Hash* field is `false`. |  |
|===

[[RepeatableInMemoryIterable]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Iterable

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | Amount of instances that are initially allowed to be kept in memory to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can fit into this buffer, then the buffer expands according to the *Buffer Size Increment* attribute, with an upper limit of *Max In Memory Size*. The default value is 100 instances. |  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | How much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer must not expand, meaning that a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error is raised when the buffer is full. The default value is 100 instances. |  |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | Maximum amount of memory to use. If more than that is used, then a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error is raised. A value lower than or equal to zero means no limit. |  |
|===

[[RepeatableFileStoreIterable]]
=== Repeatable File Store Iterable

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| In Memory Objects a| Number | Maximum amount of instances to keep in memory. If more than that is required, content on the disk is buffered. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | Unit for the *In Memory Size* field. |  |

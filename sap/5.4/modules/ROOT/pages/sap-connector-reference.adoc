= SAP Connector 5.4 Reference - Mule 4



Anypoint Connector for SAP (SAP Connector) enables the integration of data to and
from external systems based on SAP NetWeaver.

NOTE: Starting with version 5.0, SAP Connector also supports connecting to an on-premises instance of SAP S/4HANA.

== Limitations

* SNC is not supported for use in Mule apps that deploy SAP Connector in CloudHub and Anypoint Runtime Fabric.
* For SAP Connector versions earlier than 5.4.0, multiple servers deployed on the same Mule runtime engine with the same PROGRAM_ID, GATEWAY_SERVICE, and GATEWAY_HOST cannot be created by the JCo library. If you attempt to create two servers with the same PROGRAM_ID, GATEWAY_SERVICE, and GATEWAY_HOST, only one server is created. To work around this, you can use two different Mule runtime engines or use the same PROGRAM_ID with two different GATEWAY_HOSTs.
* SAP Connector does not support Bitronix Transaction Manager.
* The reconnection strategy on SAP Listeners (Function Listener and Document Listener) relies exclusively on the JCo library, which means that the Mule reconnection mechanism has no impact on reconnections.
* The JCO Server that runs in the background manages the reconnection when there is a connection issue. The JCo RFC provider recognizes a communication error between the Java server and the ABAP gateway and attempts to reconnect. If the first reconnection fails, the next reconnection attempt occurs after waiting for one second. If the reconnection fails again, the reconnection wait time doubles from one second to two seconds, until eventually it reaches the default maximum waiting period of 3600 seconds, or one hour. Set the maximum reconnection timeout using the `-Djco.server.max_startup_delay=<reconnect delay in seconds>` JMV parameter.

[[asyncRfc]]
=== Asynchronous Remote Function Call
`<sap:async-rfc>`

Executes a BAPIFunction over a queued Remote Function Call (qRFC). A queued RFC is an extension of a transactional RFC (tRFC) that ensures that individual steps are processed in sequence.

To guarantee that multiple Logical Unit of Work (LUWs) transactions are processed in the order specified by the application. tRFC can be serialized using inbound and outbound queues; hence the name queued RFC (qRFC).  qRFC is best used as an extension of tRFC to define a processing sequence. Use qRFC to guarantee that several transactions are processed in a predefined order.

[[send]]
=== Send IDoc
`<sap:send>`

Sends an IDocument to SAP over an RFC. An RFC can be one of two types for IDocuments:

* Transactional (tRFC): A tRFC is a special form of asynchronous Remote Function Call (aRFC). Transactional RFC ensures transaction-like handling of processing steps that were originally handled autonomously. tRFC is an asynchronous communication method that executes the called function module in the RFC server only once, even if the data is sent multiple times due to some network issue. The remote system need not be available at the time the RFC client program is executing a tRFC.  The tRFC component stores the called RFC function, together with the corresponding data, in the SAP database under a unique transaction ID (TID). tRFC is similar to aRFC in that it does not wait at the target system (similar to a registered post). If the system is not available, the data is written into aRFC tables with a transaction ID (SM58) that is chosen by the scheduler RSARFCSE and run every 60 seconds.  tRFC is best used as an extension of asynchronous RFC secure communication between systems.

* Queued (qRFC): A queued RFC is an extension of tRFC. It also ensures that individual steps are processed in sequence. Use qRFC to guarantee that multiple LUWs (Logical Unit of Work transactions) are processed in the order specified by the application. tRFC can be serialized using inbound and outbound queues, hence the name queued RFC (qRFC).  qRFC is best used as an extension of tRFC to define a processing sequence.  Implement qRFC if you want to guarantee that several transactions are processed in a predefined order.

Both tRFC and qRFC have a TID handler.

[[syncRfc]]
=== Synchronous Remote Function Call
`<sap:sync-rfc>`

Executes a BAPIFunction over a synchronous remote function call (sRFC). A synchronous RFC requires both the systems (client and server) to be available at the time of communication or data transfer. sRFC is the most common type and is used when a result is required immediately after the execution of sRFC.  sRFC is a means of communication between systems where acknowledgments are required.

The resources of the source system wait at the target system and ensure that they deliver the message or data with ACKD. The Data is consistent and reliable for communication.  If the target system is not available, the source system resources wait until the target system is available. This can lead to the processes of the source system going into Sleep/RFC/CPIC mode at the target systems, which blocks these resources.  Use sRFC for communication between systems, and communication between an SAP web application server and an SAP GUI.

When streaming in this mode, Mule never uses the disk to buffer the contents. If you exceed the buffer size, the message fails.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | The amount of memory to allocate to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can fit into this buffer, then the buffer expands according to *Buffer Size Increment*, with an upper limit of *Max Buffer Size*. |  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This is by how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer should not expand, meaning that a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised when the buffer gets full. |  |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | The maximum amount of memory to use. If more than that is used then a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised. A value lower than or equal to zero means no limit. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which all these attributes are expressed. |  |

[[repeatable-file-store-stream]]
=== Repeatable File Store Stream

File store repeatable streams require buffering, and there are different buffering strategies. Mule keeps a portion of contents in memory. If the stream contents are larger than the configured buffer size, Mule backs up the buffer’s content to disk and then clears the memory.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| In Memory Size a| Number | Defines the maximum memory that the stream should use to keep data in memory. If more than that is consumed content on the disk is buffered. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which maxInMemorySize is expressed. |  |

[[RedeliveryPolicy]]
=== Redelivery Policy

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Redelivery Count a| Number | The maximum number of times a message can be redelivered and processed unsuccessfully before triggering process-failed-message. |  |
| Use Secure Hash a| Boolean | Whether to use a secure hash algorithm to identify a redelivered message. |  |
| Message Digest Algorithm a| String | The secure hashing algorithm to use. If not set, the default is SHA-256. |  |
| Id Expression a| String | Defines one or more expressions to use to determine when a message has been redelivered. This property may only be set if useSecureHash is `false`. |  |
| Object Store a| Object Store | The object store where the redelivery counter for each message is stored. |  |

IDoc parsing options

[cols=".^20%,.^25%,.^30%,.^15%,.^10%", options="header"]
|======================
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Parse With Field Value Checking a| Boolean | Indicates whether to enable the field value checking mechanism in accordance with the respective IDoc field metadata when parsing | false |
| Parse Ignore Unknown Fields a| Boolean | Indicates whether to ignore unknown fields when parsing, for example, when parsing with older IDoc metadata | false |
| Parse Ignore Invalid Char Errors a| Boolean | Indicates whether to ignore character range check errors in accordance with the declared XML specification version when parsing.
When using this option, invalid characters within field values are accepted, although the XML document to parse might contain characters that are not in the valid character range. | false |
| Parse Without Field Data Type Checking a| Boolean | Indicates whether to disable the field data type checking mechanism in accordance with the respective IDoc field metadata when parsing.
{sp} +
{sp} +
*Caution*: Use this option with care.
Sending IDocs with illegal field contents that violate the field's defined datatype can cause ABAP system dumps and result in unrecognized partial loss of data when processed in an AS ABAP system. | false |
| Parse Refuse Unknown XML Version a| Boolean | Indicates whether to refuse XML documents that declare an unknown XML specification version, for example, a potential future XML specification version 1.2 or 2.0 | false |
| Parse Refuse XML Version10 a| Boolean | Indicates whether to refuse XML documents that don't use XML specification version 1.0 or that don't contain an XML declaration header | false |
| Parse Refuse XML Version11 a| Boolean | Indicates whether to refuse XML documents that use XML specification version 1.1 | false |
| Parse Accept Only Xml Version10 a| Boolean | Indicates whether to accept only XML documents that use XML specification version 1.0 or that don't contain an XML declaration header | false |
| Parse Accept Only Xml Version11 a| Boolean | Indicates whether to accept only XML documents that use XML specification version 1.1 or that don't contain an XML declaration header | false |
| Parse Accept Only Xml Version10 To11 a| Boolean | Indicates whether to accept only XML documents that use XML specification version 1.0 or 1.1 or that don't contain an XML declaration header | false |

[[executeQueuedRemoteFunctionCall]]
=== Execute BAPI / Function over qRFC
`<sap:execute-queued-remote-function-call>`


Executes a BAPI function over a queued Remote Function Call (qRFC). A queued RFC is an extension of a transactional RFC (tRFC) that ensures that individual steps are processed in sequence. To guarantee that multiple Logical Unit of Work (LUWs) transactions are processed in the order specified by the application, tRFC can be serialized using inbound and outbound queues; hence the name queued RFC (qRFC).

Use qRFC to extend tRFC and define the processing sequence.  qRFC is recommended if you want to guarantee that several transactions are processed in a predefined order.

[[executeSynchronousRemoteFunctionCall]]
=== Execute BAPI function over sRFC
`<sap:execute-synchronous-remote-function-call>`


Executes a BAPI function over a synchronous Remote Function Call (sRFC). A synchronous RFC requires that both the client and server systems are available at the time of communication or data transfer. A synchronous RFC is the most common type and is used when a result is required immediately after the sRFC is executed.

Use sRFC when communication between source and target systems requires acknowledgments. The resources of the source system wait at the target system and ensure that the message or data is delivered with an acknowledgment (ACKD) and that the data is consistent and reliable for communication.

If the target system is not available, the source system resources wait until the target system is available. This may cause the processes of the source system to go into Sleep/RFC/CPIC mode at the target systems and block the resources.

sRFC is best used for:

* Communication between systems
* Communication between the SAP Web Application Server to the SAP GUI

[[executeTransactionalRemoteFunctionCall]]
=== Execute BAPI function over tRFC
`<sap:execute-transactional-remote-function-call>`


Executes a BAPI function over a Transactional Remote Function Call (tRFC). A tRFC is a special form of asynchronous Remote Function Call (aRFC). Transactional RFC ensures transaction-like handling of processing steps that were originally autonomous.

tRFC is an asynchronous communication method that executes the called function module in the RFC server only once, even if the data is sent multiple times due to a network issue. The remote system does not need to be available at the time when the RFC client program is executing a tRFC. The tRFC component stores the called RFC function, together with the corresponding data, in the SAP database under a unique transaction ID (TID).

tRFC is similar to aRFC as it does not wait at the target system (similar to a registered post). If the system is not available, it writes the data into aRFC tables with a transaction ID (SM58), which is picked by the scheduler RSARFCSE and runs every 60 seconds).

tRFC is best used for:

* Extension of asynchronous RFC
* Secure communication between systems

[[send]]
=== Send IDoc
`<sap:send>`


Sends an IDoc to SAP over an RFC. An RFC can be one of two types for IDocs:

* Transactional (tRFC): A tRFC is a special form of asynchronous Remote Function Call (aRFC). Transactional RFC ensures transaction-like handling of processing steps that were originally handled autonomously. tRFC is an asynchronous communication method that executes the called function module in the RFC server only once, even if the data is sent multiple times due to some network issue. The remote system does not need to be available at the time the RFC client program is executing a tRFC.  +
The tRFC component stores the called RFC function, together with the corresponding data, in the SAP database under a unique transaction ID (TID). +
tRFC is similar to aRFC in that it does not wait at the target system (similar to a registered post). If the system is not available, the data is written into aRFC tables with a transaction ID (SM58) that is chosen by the scheduler RSARFCSE and run every 60 seconds. +
tRFC is best used for:
** Extension of asynchronous RFC
** Secure communication between systems
* Queued (qRFC): A queued RFC is an extension of tRFC. tRFC can be serialized using inbound and outbound queues, hence the name queued RFC (qRFC). It also ensures that individual steps are processed in sequence. Use qRFC to guarantee that multiple LUWs (Logical Unit of Work transactions) are processed in the order specified by the application. +
qRFC is best used as an extension of tRFC to define a processing sequence.  Implementation of qRFC is recommended if you want to guarantee that several transactions are processed in a predefined order.

[[Reconnection]]
=== Reconnection

The Reconnection Strategy settings are not enabled. Although disabled, reconnection is automatic when a computer running SAP Connector is disconnected and reconnected. Reconnection occurs based on default conditions established in the SAP JCo libraries. However, if the computer is accessing the SAP instance via VPN, reconnection fails and SAP Connector displays `TIMEOUT` and `CANNOT_SEND_IDOC` errors.

[[repeatable-in-memory-stream]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Stream

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | The amount of memory that will be allocated to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the data in this stream is larger than the buffer size, then the buffer expands according to the *Buffer size increment* attribute, with an upper limit of *Max in Memory Size*. |  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This is by how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer should not expand, meaning that a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error is raised when the buffer gets full. |  |
| Max in Memory Size a| Number | The maximum amount of memory to use. If more than that is used then a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error is raised. A value lower than or equal to zero means no limit. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which all these attributes are expressed |  |

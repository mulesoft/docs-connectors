== Topic Title
:license-info: Enterprise

*_Premium_*

This connector requires a separate license. Contact mailto:sales@mulesoft.com[MuleSoft] to evaluate or use this connector in production.

== Overview

Mule ESB supports SAP integration through our xref:3.5@mule-runtime::anypoint-connectors.adoc[Anypoint Connector] for SAP, which is an SAP-certified Java connector that leverages the SAP Java Connector (JCo) libraries.  The SAP connector enables Mule applications to:

* Send IDocs over tRFC and qRFC
* Receive IDocs over tRFC and qRFC
* Transform all SAP objects (JCoFunction & IDocs) both to and from XML
* Execute Business Application Programming Interface (BAPI) functions using all of the following types of Remote Function Calls (RFC) +
** sRFC (synchronous RFC)
** tRFC (transactional RFC)
** qRFC (queued RFC)
* Act as a JCo Server to be called as a BAPI over the following protocols: +
** sRFC
** tRFC
** qRFC

== Installation

You can install a connector in Anypoint Studio using the instructions in xref:3.5@mule-runtime::installing-connectors.adoc[To Install a Connector from Anypoint Exchange].

== Before You Begin

This connector requires the following SAP libraries:

* Java Connector (JCo) library (Platform-dependent)
* IDoc library

Note that the JCo library is dependent on both your hardware platform and operating system, so you need to download the correct version for the local drive running Anypoint Studio.

Three files are required for both libraries:

* Both multi-platform Java libraries: +
** sapjco3.jar
** sapidoc3.jar

* One of the JCo platform-specific native libraries: +
** sapjco3.dll (Windows)
** libsapjco3.jnilib (Mac OS X)
** libsapjco3.so (Linux)

*Important:*

* Do not change the names of any of the SAP JCo library files from their original names, as they won't be recognized by JCo. Because of this, Studio validates against unfamiliar JCo file names.
* If you deploy to a platform that is different from the one used for development, you *must* change the native library before generating the zip file.

Download the requisite http://service.sap.com/connectors[SAP libraries]. To perform this download, you must have an SAP user ID.

You add the SAP libraries to your Studio project when configuring the SAP global element. For details, see <<Adding the SAP Libraries>> below.

[NOTE]
To enable SAP to communicate with Mule, you need to perform additional SAP configuration. SAP configuration facilitates many options, which should be set by your SAP system administrator.

== Adding the SAP Connector to the Classpath

Specifying the location of the SAP connector in your system `classpath` enables you to run/debug your project locally and to create custom Java code in your project that uses the classes.

The first time you try to add any of the SAP components to your Mule configuration file, the SAP dependencies that match the version of the project ESB runtime get added automatically. In case there is more than one SAP transport dependency for the ESB runtime configured in the project, then you will be prompted to select the one you want to use.

image::select-sap-connector.png[select-SAP-connector]

To add the SAP connector manually to the classpath, complete the following steps:

. Right-click the top of the project in the Package Explorer pane.
. Select *Build Path* > *Add Libraries ...*
. Select the library type** Anypoint Connectors Dependencies* and then click *Next**.
. On the *Extensions Classpath* list, check the SAP extension.

image::addsaplibrary.png[AddSAPlibrary]

== Configuration

You can employ the SAP connector in any of the configurations listed below.

[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
|Configuration |Activity
|*IDoc Inbound Endpoint* |The SAP connector registers with a SAP server Gateway using a specific Program ID. This enables it to send and receive IDocs sent to that destination.
|*Function Inbound Endpoint* |The SAP connector registers with a SAP server Gateway using a specific Program ID that allows the SAP transport to be called as a Function or BAPI using the RFC protocol drawn from ABAP code in SAP.
|*IDoc Outbound Endpoint* |The SAP connector sends an IDoc generated within Mule ESB to a SAP server.
|*Function Outbound Endpoint* |The SAP connector calls a Function or BAPI that resides on a SAP server.
|===

The SAP connector uses JCo as the underlying SAP integration technology. The Inbound Endpoints (both IDoc and Function) start a JCo server, while the Outbound Endpoints rely on the JCo client.

The connector allows both synchronous and asynchronous communications. By definition, functions are synchronous and IDocs are asynchronous.

* IDocs can be sent and received over tRFC and qRFC
* Functions (both inbound and outbound) allow sRFC, tRFC and qRFC

[TIP]
====
If the SAP Connector is configured as a function, the value of the *Function Name* property references different objects, depending on context:

* For inbound endpoints, *Function Name* is the name of the function that this server handles. If no value is provided, all functions will be handled.
* For outbound endpoints, *Function Name* is the name of the SAP object. If executing a function, this will be the name of the BAPI. This value is not required if the BAPI name is provided by the payload or nested element. If sending an IDoc, this may be the name of the IDoc. In this last case, this value is only used by DataSense during design time and will be ignored during runtime
====

As from version 2.1.0, the SAP Outbound Endpoint can also be used to generate a template of a valid XML that represents a BAPI or an IDoc. In order to achieve this. the type should be configured to *function-metadata* or *idoc-metadata* and the *Function Name* set to hold the name of the BAPI or IDoc.

=== SAP Connector and DataSense

If you intend to employ an SAP endpoint in conjunction with a xref:6@studio::datamapper-user-guide-and-reference.adoc[DataMapper transformer] to map and transform data, you can make use of Anypoint Studio's xref:3.5@mule-runtime::datasense.adoc[DataSense] functionality.

. Follow the detailed xref:3.5@mule-runtime::datasense.adoc[DataSense] instructions to drop the endpoint into your flow, then xref:5@studio::testing-connections.adoc[test the connection] to SAP using the SAP Connector.
. In your flow, define the *Object Name* in the endpoint which should be the complete name of the BAPI or IDoc. You can also follow the instructions in the following section to find the BAPI or IDoc.
. For a more DataMapper-friendly experience, use the *XML Version* selector to select `XML Version 2` `(DataMapper)`. `XML Version 1` is functional, but the mapping experience is inferior to that available with version 2.
. Drop a *DataMapper* into your flow, before or after the SAP endpoint, then click the DataMapper transformer to display the DataMapper properties editor. Having collected metadata from SAP, Mule automatically prescribes the input or output (relative to the position of the SAP endpoint to DataMapper) to use in mapping and transforming data.
. Define specific mappings to or from SAP, then save your flow.

==== Finding the SAP object

Since Mule runtime version 3.5.0 and SAP connector version 2.2.2, Studio allows searching BAPIs or IDocs.

image::sap-basic-settings.png[SAP-basic-settings]

. Make sure you have selected the *Connector Configuration.*
. Specify the SAP object *Type* to search (IDoc or Function).
. Click the *Select* button to open the find SAP Object form.
+
image::search-sap-object.png[]

. Type a valid filter. (At least one character should be typed in.) You can use the wildcard '*' and by default the filter type will be 'starts with'.
. Once results are displayed, you can right-click each row to export the XML or XSD representation of the BAPI (XML version 1 or 2) or IDoc. When a row in the result is selected, you can then press the *Select* button to set the value of the *Object Name*.
+
image::select-export-sap-object.png[]

== SAP Transformers

The SAP endpoints receive and transmit SAP objects, which must be transformed to and from XML within your Mule flow. MuleSoft bundles three SAP transformers specifically designed to handle such transformation:

* SAP Object to XML
* XML to SAP Function (BAPI)
* XML to SAP IDoc

These are available in the *Transformers* group on the Studio Palette. Entering *SAP* into the filter input box above the palette displays both the SAP Connector and the SAP Transformers (below):

image::sapfilter.png[SAPfilter]

Click and drag the *SAP Object to XML* transformer _after_ an SAP inbound endpoint (or a SAP outbound endpoint if the endpoint is a function and expects a response).

[WARNING]
====
With DataSense enablement on the SAP endpoint came a new attribute,` outputXml `. The default value, `false`, ensures that the output produced by the endpoint is XML instead of a Java object.

However, if you set this value to `true` in order to output a Java Object, avoid the subsequent use of an *SAP Object to XML* transformer.
====

Click and drag the *XML to SAP Function (BAPI)* or the *XML to SAP IDoc* transformers _before_ your SAP outbound endpoint within your Mule application flow.

[NOTE]
====
Since version 2.2.2 of the SAP connector (released with Mule 3.5.0) it is no longer required to use the explicit transformers. The input to the outbound-endpoint can be both the SAP Object created by the *XML to SAP Function (BAPI)* or the *XML to SAP IDoc* as well as any type (String, byte[] or InputStream) that represents the XML document.

As mentioned before, in order to avoid using the *SAP Object to XML* you can now use the `outputXML` attribute set to ` true ` at the endpoint level (works for both inbound and outbound SAP endpoints).
====

== SAP Inbound Endpoint Requirements

If you are configuring a SAP Inbound Endpoint (JCo Server), and you want to use the service name (and not the port value) as the value of `jcoGwService` attribute, you must modify your OS `services` file, which is:

* `/etc/services` for a Unix-based OS
* `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\services` for Windows

In the above file, you must add your gateway (which is configured through the `jcoGwService` attribute or the `jco.server.gwserv /jco.client.gwserv` property). Just add the gateway; you don’t need to add the entire service mapping list.

For example, to set the following, `jcoGwService=sapgw00`, add the following string:

[source,text,linenums]
----
bq. sapgw00 3300/tcp
----

Port 3300 is predefined by SAP, so if you need to validate other port numbers based on your SAP instance number, you can check the complete list of xref:3.5@mule-runtime::sap-jco-server-services-configuration.adoc[service-to-port mappings].

This configuration can be avoided if using the port (for example 3300) as the value of the  `jcoGwService` attribute (or `jco.server.gwserv /jco.client.gwserv` properties).

== Connector Global Element

The SAP connector object holds the configuration properties that allow you to connect to the SAP server. When an SAP connector is defined as a *Global Element* all SAP endpoints use its connection parameters; otherwise each SAP endpoint uses its own connection parameters to connect to the SAP server.

To create an SAP connector, complete the following steps:

. Click the *Global Elements* tab below the *Message Flow* canvas.
. Click *Create*, then click the arrow icon to the left of Connector Configurations.
. Select *SAP* from the drop-down list of available connectors, then click *OK*.
. In the *Global Elements Properties* pane, enter the required parameters for defining an SAP connection, which your SAP system administrator should supply.

=== Connection Properties

The SAP global element allows you to define connection properties as well as to easily add the SAP `.jar` libraries to your project.

Many SAP connection properties exist. For ease of use, the SAP connector only shows the most common properties as connector parameters. To configure a property that is not listed in the Properties pane, consult <<Extended Properties>>.

image::sap-global-elem.png[sap.global.elem]

At a minimum, provide values for the following attributes:

* In the *Name* field, enter an appropriate name for the Connector used by the SAP endpoints in your project.
* As in other connectors, DataSense can be globally disabled by unchecking the Enable DataSense checkbox.
* In the *AS Host* field, enter the name (URL or IP address) of the SAP system.
* In the *User* and *Password* fields, enter the username and password of a user authorized to connect to the SAP system.
* In the *SAP System Number* field, enter the system number used to connect to the SAP system.
* In the *SAP Client* field, enter the SAP client ID (usually a number) used to connect to the SAP system.
* In the *Login Language* field, enter the language that will be used in the SAP connection, for example *EN* for English.

=== Adding the SAP Libraries

As explained in <<Prerequisites>>, the SAP connector requires the platform-dependent SAP JCo library as well as the multi-platform IDoc library. To add these libraries to your project, click the *Add File* button next to each of the listed libraries, then browse to and select the appropriate file. The files `sapjco3.jar` and `sapidoc3.jar` are platform-independent; for *JCo Native Library*, you must have the correct platform-dependent library file, such as `sapjco3.dll`, `libsapjco3.jnilib` or `libsapjco3.so`.

The SAP libraries are automatically added to the project `classpath`.

*Important:*
If you are adding the JCo libraries and configuring the classpath manually, since SAP JCo 3.0.11, to have DataSense working, you need to make sure that the sapjco3.jar and the corresponding native library are not in the same directory.


=== Extended Properties

To provide additional configuration properties, you can define a Spring bean global element representing a Map (`java.util.Map`) instance. This can be used to configure, among other properties, SCN (Secure Connections), or advanced pooling capabilities.

In this case, you must know the configuration property _as defined by SAP_. You can check xref:3.5@mule-runtime::sap-jco-extended-properties.adoc[the configuration properties list].

To define extended properties for the *SAP global connector*, complete the following steps:

. Navigate to the *Advanced* tab on the *Global Elements Properties* pane.
. Locate the *Extended Properties* section at the bottom of the window.
. Click the plus icon next to the *Extended Properties* drop-down menu to define additional configuration properties.

image::sap-connector-adv.png[]

== Prioritizing Connection Properties

Properties for SAP connections, both inbound and outbound, can be configured in numerous places, which may cause an overlap of connection parameters. The following list details the priorities accorded to values specified in different places, with the highest priority level listed first.

. Attributes defined at the *SAP Inbound Endpoint* and *SAP Outbound Endpoint* level, such as *User*, *Password*, *Gateway Host*, etc.
. Properties in the *Address* attribute at the *SAP Inbound Endpoint* and *SAP Outbound Endpoint* levels. (However, MuleSoft does not recommend using the *Address* attribute for SAP connections.)
. Properties inside the Map configured in the *Extended Properties* pane for the JCo client or server at the *SAP Inbound Endpoint* and *SAP Outbound Endpoint* levels.
. Attributes configured at the *SAP Connector Configuration* level (i.e., *AS Host*, *User Password*, *SAP Client*, etc.).
. Properties inside the Map configured in the *Extended Properties* pane at the *SAP Connector Configuration* level.
. Default values.

== XML Definition

With DataSense support, the recommended way to generate the XML definitions is using xref:6@studio::datamapper-user-guide-and-reference.adoc[DataMapper] (and XML version 2 for BAPIs/Functions).

The SAP transport bundles <<SAP Transformers>> that convert the XML documents exchanged between the endpoints and SAP into corresponding SAP objects that the endpoints can handle.

For more information about using XML definitions without DataMapper and DataSense, see xref:3.6@mule-runtime::xml-definitions.adoc[XML Definitions].

== Inbound Endpoint

An Inbound Endpoint receives IDocs and Functions over RFC. To implement a *SAP Inbound Endpoint*, complete the following steps:

. Drag and drop the *SAP Connector* from the Connectors group on the palette to the beginning of your flow.
. Double-click the SAP icon to open the *Endpoint Properties* pane, then define your endpoint's properties.
. In the *Type* drop-down menu, select whether to receive IDocs or Function calls.

image::sap-endpoint-type.png[]


After selecting the Endpoint type, the properties editor will automatically enable or disable parameter input boxes according to the selected endpoint type. For example, after selecting *IDoc* as the Endpoint Type, function-related parameters such as the *Function Name* input box or the *Evaluate Function Response* checkbox will be disabled.


Since the JCo server needs to register with the SAP instance, you must specify _both_ the *client* and *server* configuration attributes.

=== Inbound Endpoint Properties

The following table lists *Inbound Endpoint* properties.

[%header,cols="5*"]
|===
|Field |XML +
Attribute |Studio Properties Editor +
Tab |Description |Default Value
|*Display Name* |name |General |The reference name of the endpoint used internally in Studio. |
|*All Exchange Patterns* |exchange-pattern |General |The available options are request-response and one-way. |
|*Address* |address |Advanced |The standard way to provide endpoint properties. For more information check: Endpoint Address. |
|*Type* |type |General |The type of SAP object this endpoint will process (i.e., *function* or *idoc*) |`function`
|*RFC Type* |rfcType |General |The type of RFC the endpoint used to receive a function or IDoc. The available options are *srfc* (which is *sync* with *no TID handler*), *trfc* and *qrfc* (both of which are *async*, with a *TID handler*). |`srfc`
|*Object Name* |functionName |General |If the type is *function* then this is the name of the BAPI function that will be handled. If no value is provided, then a generic handler is configured to receive all calls. |

|*Program ID* |jcoProgramId |General |The program ID with which the registration is performed. |
|*Connection Count* |jcoConnectionCount |General |The number of connections that should be registered at the gateway. |2
|*Extended Properties* |jcoClientExtendedProperties-ref |Advanced |A Reference to `java.util.Map`, which contains additional JCo connection parameters. As necessary, consult the xref:3.5@mule-runtime::sap-jco-extended-properties.adoc[complete list of parameters]. |
|===

=== IDoc Endpoint Properties

To configure an IDoc Server, complete the following steps.

. Starting from the *General* tab of the SAP Endpoint properties editor, set the *Type* property to *IDoc*.
. Define the *RFC Type* parameter as *Transactional RFC (tRFC)* or **Queued RFC (qRFC)**. IDocs are asynchronous by definition, so they cannot be received over **Synchronous RFC (sRFC)**.
. <<Configuring the TID Handler>>. The default is an in-memory TID handler.
. Specify the following required attributes: +
* Gateway Host
* Gateway Service
* Program ID
. Click the *Advanced* tab, then specify the required connection attributes, as necessary, for the endpoint or the connector. This might include, for example, *SAP Client*, *User*, *Password*, *AS Host* and *SAP System Number*.

=== Function Endpoint Properties

To configure the connector as an RFC Server, complete the following steps.

. Set the *type* parameter to `function`.
. Define the *rfcType* parameter to `trfc`, `qrfc` or `srfc`. If *rfcType* is not specified, `srfc` is used by default.
. When *rfcType* is `trfc` or `qrfc`, you may also need to <<Configuring the TID Handler>>.
. Specify the following required attributes: *jcoGwHost*, *jcoGwService*, *jcoProgramId*.
. Specify the required connection attributes, as necessary, for the endpoint or the connector. This might include, for example, *jcoClient*, *jcoUser*, *jcoPasswd*, *jcoAsHost*, *jcoSysnr*.
. In the *General* tab, set the *Type* property to `Function (BAPI)`.
. Define the *RFC Type* parameter as `Transactional RFC (tRFC)`, `Queued RFC (qRFC)` or `Synchronous RFC (sRFC)`.
. If the *RFC Type* is either `Transactional RFC (tRFC)` or `Queued RFC (qRFC)`, then <<Configuring the TID Handler>>.
. Specify the following required attributes: +
* *Gateway Host*
* *Gateway Service*
* *Program ID*
. In the *Advanced* tab, specify the required connection attributes, as necessary, for the endpoint or the connector. This might include, for example, *SAP Client*, *User*, *Password*, *AS Host* and *SAP System Number*.

=== Configuring the TID Handler

The TID handler (Transaction ID) is an important component for *tRFC* and *qRFC*, ensuring that Mule ESB does not process the same transaction twice.

To define the TID handler, complete the following steps.

. In the *General* tab of the *Endpoint Properties* window, locate the *TID Store* section near the bottom of the window.
. From the *Type* drop-down menu, select one of the three options for the TID handler: +
* *None*: No TID handler.
* *Default In Memory TID Store*: Facilitates the sharing of TIDs within the same Mule ESB instance. If the Endpoint *Type* is `tRFC` or `qRFC`, and no TID store is configured, then this default store is used.
* *Object Store TID Store*: This wrapper uses existing Mule ESB object stores to store and share TIDs. If you need multiple Mule ESB server instances, you should configure a JDBC Object Store so that you can share TIDs among the instances.

[NOTE]
When the Endpoint *Type* is set to **Synchronous RFC (sRFC)**, or it is not provided (thus defaulting to *Synchronous RFC*), then no TID handler is configured. Furthermore, if a TID handler has been configured in the XML file, it will be ignored.

To configure an **In-memory TID Store**, you must observe the following:

* the In-memory TID Store won't work as expected if you have multiple Mule ESB instances that share the same *program id*. (This is because the SAP gateway load-balances across all registered SAP servers that share the same *program id*)
* the Endpoint *Type* should be *trfc* or *qrfc*
* configuring the child element `<sap:default-in-memory-tid-store/>` is optional, since the in-memory handler is the default option

=== Advanced


The address attribute is supported by the SAP connector for compatibility with other Mule  endpoints.

MuleSoft recommends that you do not configure this attribute for the SAP connector.


You can override all *Connector* properties by including a new reference to an *Extended Properties* map.

=== Server Extended Properties

When configuring the inbound endpoint, you may also provide specific server configuration advanced properties.

== Outbound Endpoint

An *Outbound Endpoint* executes functions (BAPIs), or it sends IDocs over RFC. Properties for an outbound endpoint resemble those of an inbound endpoint, and you configure them through the properties editor.

In an Outbound Endpoint, the IDoc or Function can be built in one of two ways:

* defined as the endpoint's payload (created by DataMapper for example)
* obtained from an XML file

To manually define the IDoc or Function, complete the following steps.

. Navigate to the *XML Definition* tab within the properties editor.
. Type or copy and paste the IDoc or Function into the input box below the *Function / IDoc XML* checkbox.

To obtain the IDoc or Function from an XML file, click *Definition File*, and do one of the following:

* type the full path to the file
* click *...* to navigate to the file

image::sap-xml-def.png[SAP-xml-def]

If you neither define the payload, nor specify a definition file, Mule builds the payload by applying a default template to the data received by the endpoint.

=== Outbound Endpoint Properties

The following table lists *Outbound Endpoint* properties:

[%header,cols="5*"]
|===
|Field |XML Attribute |Studio Properties Editor Tab |Description |Default Value
|*Display Name* |name |General |The reference name of the endpoint used internally by Mule configuration. |
|*All Exchange Patterns* |exchange-pattern |General |The available options are request-response and one-way. |
|*Address* |address |Advanced |The standard way to provide endpoint properties. For more information check: Endpoint Address. |
|*Type* |type |General |The type of SAP object this endpoint will process (i.e., *function* or *idoc*). Starting in 2.1.0 *function-metadata* and *idoc-metadata* can be used to retrieved XML structure for a given BAPI or IDoc. |`function`
|*RFC Type* |rfcType |General |The type of RFC the endpoint used to receive a function or IDoc. The available options are *srfc* (which is *sync* with *no TID handler*), *trfc* and *qrfc* (both of which are *async*, with a *TID handler*). |`srfc`
|*Queue Name* |queueName |General |If the RFC type is *qrfc*, then this will be the name of the queue. |
|*Function Name* |functionName |General |If the type is *function* then this is the name of the BAPI function that will be executed. When a metadata type is selected then this attribute holds the name of the BAPI or IDoc whose metadata should be retrieved. |
|*XML Version* |xmlVersion |General |When type is one of metadata types, then the version of the XML to generate (There are two possible XML versions for functions) |1
|*Output XML* |outputXml |General |Whether the endpoint should set as payload the XML representation (String) of the SAP Object (Function or IDoc) or the SapObject wrapper itself. Setting this flag to 'true' removes the need for the object-to-xml transformer. |`false`
|*Evaluate Function Response (checkbox)* |evaluateFunctionResponse |General |When the type is *function*, a `true` flag (i.e., box checked) indicates that the SAP transport should evaluate the function response and throw an exception when an error occurs in SAP. When this flag is set to `false` (box unchecked), the SAP transport does not throw an exception when an error occurs, and the user is responsible for parsing the function response. |`false`
|*Is BAPI Transaction (checkbox)* |bapiTransaction |General |When checked, either *BAPI_TRANSACTION_COMMIT* or *BAPI_TRANSACTION_ROLLBACK* is called at the end of the transaction, depending on the result of that transaction. |`false`
|*Definition File* |definitionFile |XML Definition |The path to the template definition file of either the function to be executed or the IDoc to be sent. |
|*IDoc Version* |idocVersion |Advanced |When the type is *idoc*, this version is used when sending the IDoc. Values for the IDoc version correspond to *IDOC_VERSION_xxxx* constants in `com.sap.conn.idoc.IDocFactory` |0 (_IDOC_VERSION_DEFAULT_).
|*SAP Client* |jcoClient |Advanced |The SAP client. This is usually an integer, such as 100. |
|*User* |jcoUser |Advanced |The logon user for password-based authentication. |
|*Password* |jcoPasswd |Advanced |The logon password associated with the logon user for password based authentication. |
|*Login Language* |jcoLang |Advanced |The login language. If not defined, the default user language is used. |`en`
|*AS Host* |jcoAsHost |Advanced |The SAP application server host. Use either the IP address or server name. |
|*SAP System Number* |jcoSysnr |Advanced |The SAP system number. |
|*Pool Capacity* |jcoPoolCapacity |Advanced |The maximum number of idle connections kept open by the destination. No connection pooling takes place when the value is 0. |5
|*Peak Limit* |jcoPeakLimit |Advanced |The maximum number of simultaneously active connections that can be created for a destination. |10
|*Extended Properties* |jcoClientExtendedProperties-ref |Advanced |A Reference to `java.util.Map`, which contains additional JCo connection parameters. As necessary, consult the xref:3.5@mule-runtime::sap-jco-extended-properties.adoc[complete list of parameters]. |
|===

=== Transactions

While the SAP outbound endpoint supports *Transactions*, distributed transactions are _not_ supported, since the JCo libraries do not support XA.

To define transaction attributes, navigate to the *General* tab of the properties editor, then locate the *Transaction* section near the bottom of the window.

image::sap-transaction.png[]

The following table lists transaction attributes:

[%header,cols="4*"]
|===
|Field |XML Attribute |Description |Default Value
|*Type* |n/a |No Transaction or Transaction |No Transaction
|*Action* |action |The action attribute is part of the Mule ESB transaction standard and can have the following values: NONE, ALWAYS_BEGIN, BEGIN_OR_JOIN, ALWAYS_JOIN and JOIN_IF_POSSIBLE |NONE
|*Timeout* |timeout |Timeout for the transaction (ms). |
|===

The BAPI transaction attribute can be found in Client Settings pane in General options tab.

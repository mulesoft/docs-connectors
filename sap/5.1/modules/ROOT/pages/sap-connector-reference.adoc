SAP Connector Version 5.1

Anypoint Connector for SAP (SAP Connector) enables the integration of data to and
from external systems based on SAP NetWeaver.

NOTE: Starting with version 5.0, SAP Connector also supports connecting to an on-premise instance of SAP S/4HANA.

Release Notes: xref:release-notes::connector/sap-connector-release-notes-mule-4.adoc[SAP Connector Release Notes]

NOTE: SNC is not supported for use in Mule apps that deploy SAP Connector in CloudHub and Anypoint Runtime Fabric.

[[asyncRfc]]
=== Asynchronous Remote Function Call
`<sap:async-rfc>`

Executes a BAPIFunction over a queued Remote Function Call (qRFC). A queued RFC is an extension of a transactional RFC (tRFC) that ensures that individual steps are processed in sequence.

To guarantee that multiple Logical Unit of Work (LUWs) transactions are processed in the order specified by the application. tRFC can be serialized using inbound and outbound queues; hence the name queued RFC (qRFC).  qRFC is best used as an extension of the transactional RFC defined processing sequence. Use qRFC to guarantee that several transactions are processed in a predefined order.

[[send]]
=== Send IDoc
`<sap:send>`

Sends an IDocument to SAP over an RFC. An RFC can be one of two types for IDocuments:

* Transactional (tRFC): A tRFC is a special form of asynchronous Remote Function Call (aRFC). Transactional RFC ensures transaction-like handling of processing steps that were originally handled autonomously. tRFC is an asynchronous communication method that executes the called function module in the RFC server only once, even if the data is sent multiple times due to some network issue. The remote system need not be available at the time the RFC client program is executing a tRFC.  The tRFC component stores the called RFC function, together with the corresponding data, in the SAP database under a unique transaction ID (TID). tRFC is similar to aRFC in that it does not wait at the target system (similar to a registered post). If the system is not available, the data is written into aRFC tables with a transaction ID (SM58) that is chosen by the scheduler RSARFCSE and run every 60 seconds.  tRFC is best used as an extension of asynchronous RFC secure communication between systems.

* Queued (qRFC): A queued RFC is an extension of tRFC. It also ensures that individual steps are processed in sequence. Use qRFC to guarantee that multiple LUWs (Logical Unit of Work transactions) are processed in the order specified by the application. tRFC can be serialized using inbound and outbound queues, hence the name queued RFC (qRFC).  qRFC is best used as an extension of tRFC to define a processing sequence.  Implement qRFC if you want to guarantee that several transactions are processed in a predefined order.

[[syncRfc]]
=== Synchronous Remote Function Call
`<sap:sync-rfc>`

Executes a BAPIFunction over a synchronous remote function call (sRFC). A synchronous RFC requires both the systems (client and server) to be available at the time of communication or data transfer. sRFC is the most common type and is used when a result is required immediately after the execution of sRFC.  sRFC is a means of communication between systems where acknowledgments are required.

The resources of the source system wait at the target system and ensure that they deliver the message or data with ACKD. The Data is consistent and reliable for communication.  If the target system is not available, the source system resources wait until the target system is available. This can lead to the processes of the source system going into Sleep/RFC/CPIC mode at the target systems, which blocks these resources.  Use sRFC for communication between systems, and communication between a SAP web application server and a SAP GUI.

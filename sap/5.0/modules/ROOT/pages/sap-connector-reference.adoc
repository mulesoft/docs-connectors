= SAP Connector 5.0 Reference
:page-aliases: connectors::sap/sap-connector-reference-50.adoc



Anypoint Connector for SAP (SAP Connector) provides a class that has an overall configuration for the SAP extension.

NOTE: SAP Connector 5.0 also supports connecting to an on-premise instance of SAP S/4HANA.

Release Notes: xref:release-notes::connector/sap-connector-release-notes-mule-4.adoc[SAP Connector Release Notes]

== Limitations

* SNC is not supported for use in Mule apps that deploy SAP Connector in CloudHub and Anypoint Runtime Fabric.
* SAP Connector was not tested using a message server configuration connected to more than one application server. Therefore, this feature is not currently supported.

=== SAP Configuration


The following parameters are for the default configuration for SAP extension inbound and outbound elements:


==== Parameters

 | The connection types to provide to this configuration. | | x
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform expires the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime purges the instances when appropriate. |  |

[[asyncRfc]]
=== Asynchronous Remote Function Call
`<sap:async-rfc>`


The asynchronous Remote Function Call (aRFC) executes a BAPIFunction over a queued Remote Function Call (qRFC). A queued RFC is an extension of a transactional RFC (tRFC) that ensures that individual steps are processed in sequence. Use qRFC to guarantee that multiple Logical Unit of Work (LUWs) transactions are processed in the order specified by the application. You can use inbound and outbound queues to serialize tRFC, hence the name queued RFC (qRFC).

qRFC is best used for:

* Extension of the Transactional RFC
* Defined processing sequence.

qRFC is recommended if you want to guarantee that several transactions are processed in a predefined order.

| Transaction Id a| String |  The ID that identifies an RFC so it's run only once |  | x
| Queue Name a| String |  The name of the queue on which the RFC executes |  |
| Transactional Action a| Enumeration, one of:

[[send]]
=== Send IDoc
`<sap:send>`

Sends an IDoc to SAP over an RFC. An RFC can be one of two types for IDocuments:

* Transactional (tRFC) +
A tRFC is a special form of asynchronous Remote Function Call (aRFC). Transactional RFC ensures transaction-like handling of processing steps that were originally handled autonomously. tRFC is an asynchronous communication method that executes the called function module in the RFC server only once, even if the data is sent multiple times due to some network issue. The remote system need not be available at the time the RFC client program is executing a tRFC. +
The tRFC component stores the called RFC function, together with the corresponding data, in the SAP database under a unique transaction ID (TID). tRFC is similar to aRFC in that it does not wait at the target system (similar to a registered post). If the system is not available, the data is written into aRFC tables with a transaction ID (SM58) that is chosen by the scheduler RSARFCSE and run every 60 seconds. +
tRFC is best used for: +
** Extension of Asynchronous
** RFC Secure communication between systems
* Queued (qRFC) +
A queued RFC is an extension of tRFC. It also ensures that individual steps are processed in sequence. Use qRFC to guarantee that multiple LUWs (Logical Unit of Work transactions) are processed in the order specified by the application. tRFC can be serialized using inbound and outbound queues, hence the name queued RFC (qRFC). +
qRFC is best used as an extension of tRFC to define a processing sequence.  Implementation of qRFC is recommended if you want to guarantee that several transactions are processed in a predefined order.

[[syncRfc]]
=== Synchronous Remote Function Call
`<sap:sync-rfc>`


Executes a BAPIFunction over a Synchronous Remote Function Call (sRFC). A synchronous RFC requires both the systems (client and server) to be available at the time of communication or data transfer. It is the most common type and is required when a result is required immediately after the execution of sRFC.

sRFC is a means of communication between systems where acknowledgments are required. The resources of the source system wait at the target system and ensure that they deliver the message or data with `ACKD`. The data is consistent and reliable for communication. The issue is if the target system is not available, the source system resources wait until the target system is available. This may lead to the processes of the source system to go into Sleep/RFC/CPIC mode at the target systems and thus blocks these resources.

sRFC is best used for:

* Communication between systems
* Communication between SAP Web Application Server to SAP GUI

The reconnection strategy for the SAP Connector applies to operations only.

When a connection fails on the `FunctionSource` or `DocumentSource`, the JCo server automatically tries to reestablish a connection in the following way:

* If the connection is not restored immediately, the JCo server waits for one second and retries.
* If the connection is not restored after the second retry, the JCo server waits for two seconds and retries.
* If the connection is still not restored, the JCo server retries at four seconds, and then again at eight seconds.

| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | Set the initial size of the buffer. This is the amount of memory to allocate to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream exceeds the initial buffer size, the buffer expands according to the *Buffer size increment* attribute, with an upper limit of the value for *Max in memory size*. |  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This value specifies how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer will not expand, and instead a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error is raised when the buffer gets full. |  |
| Max in Memory Size a| Number | The maximum amount of memory to use. If more than that is used then a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error is raised. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which all these attributes are expressed |  |

[[repeatable-file-store-stream]]
=== Repeatable File Store Stream

If you need to handle large or small files, you can change the buffer size (*In memory size*) to optimize performance:

* Configuring a larger buffer size increases performance by avoiding the number of times Mule runtime engine needs to write the buffer to your disk, but it also limits the number of concurrent requests your application can process.
* Configuring a smaller buffer size saves memory load.

Use the following parameters to configure a repeatable file store stream:

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| In Memory Size a| Number | Defines the maximum memory that the stream should use to keep data in memory. If more than that is consumed then it will start to buffer the content on disk. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which *Max in memory size* is expressed |  |

[[RedeliveryPolicy]]
=== Redelivery Policy

A redelivery policy is a filter that helps you conserve resources by limiting the number of times the Mule runtime engine (Mule) executes messages that generate errors. You can add a redelivery policy to any source in a flow.

Each time the source receives a new message, Mule identifies the message by generating its key.

* If the processing flow causes an exception, Mule increments the counter associated with the message key. When the counter reaches a value greater than the configured *Max redelivery count* value, Mule throws a `MULE:REDELIVERY_EXHAUSTED` error.
* If the processing flow does not cause an exception, its counter is reset.

Use the following parameters to configure the redelivery policy:

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Redelivery Count a| Number | The maximum number of times a message can be redelivered and processed unsuccessfully before triggering a process failed message | `5` |
| Use Secure Hash a| Boolean | Whether to use a secure hash algorithm to identify a redelivered message | `true` |
| Message Digest Algorithm a| String | The secure hashing algorithm to use | `SHA-256` |
| Id Expression a| String | Defines one or more expressions to use to determine when a message has been redelivered. You can only use this property if *Use secure hash* is `false`. |  |
| Object Store a| Object Store | The object store where the redelivery counter for each message is stored |  |

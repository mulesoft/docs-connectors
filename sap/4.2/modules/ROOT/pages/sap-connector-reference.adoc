Release Notes: xref:release-notes::connector/sap-connector-release-notes-mule-4.adoc[SAP Connector Release Notes]

== Configurations
---
[[inbound-config]]
== Inbound Configuration

Default configuration for SAP extension inbound elements.

=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required

[[executeQueuedRemoteFunctionCall]]
=== Execute BAPI Function over qRFC

`<sap:execute-queued-remote-function-call>`

Executes a BAPI function over a queued remote function call (qRFC). A queued RFC is an extension of tRFC that ensures that individual steps are processed in sequence.

To guarantee that multiple LUWs (Logical Unit of Work transaction) are processed in the order specified by the application. tRFC can be serialized using queues (inbound and outbound queues). Hence the name queued RFC (qRFC).

Use qRFC to extend the Transactional RFC Defined processing sequence.

Implementation of qRFC is recommended to guarantee that several transactions are processed in a predefined order.

[[executeSynchronousRemoteFunctionCall]]
=== Execute BAPI Function over sRFC

`<sap:execute-synchronous-remote-function-call>`


Executes a BAPI function over a Synchronous Remote Function Call (sRFC).

A synchronous RFC requires both the systems (client and server) to be available at the time of communication or data transfer. It is the most common type and is required when result is required immediately after the execution of sRFC.

sRFC is a means of communication between systems where acknowledgments are required. The resources of the source system wait at the target system and ensure that they deliver the message and data with ACKD. The data is consistent and reliable for communication.

NOTE: If the target system is not available, the source system resources wait until the target system is available. This may lead to the processes of the source system to go into Sleep RFC or CPIC Mode at the target systems and block these resources.

sRFC is best used for:

* Communication between systems.
* Communication between SAP Web Application Server to SAP GUI.

[[executeTransactionalRemoteFunctionCall]]
=== Execute BAPI Function over tRFC

`<sap:execute-transactional-remote-function-call>`

Executes a BAPI function over a Transactional Remote Function Call (tRFC).

A tRFC is a special form of asynchronous Remote Function Call (aRFC). Transactional RFC ensures transaction-like handling of processing steps that were originally autonomous. tRFC is an asynchronous communication method that executes the called function module in the RFC server only once, even if the data is sent multiple times due to some network issue. The remote system need not be available at the time when the RFC client program is executing a tRFC.

The tRFC component stores in the called RFC function together with the corresponding data in the SAP database under a unique transaction ID (TID). tRFC is similar to aRFC as it does not wait at the target system (similar to a registered post). If the system is not available, this operation writes the data into aRFC tables with a transaction ID (SM58), which is picked by the scheduler RSARFCSE that runs for every 60 seconds.

tRFC is best used to extend asynchronous RFC for secure communication between systems.

[[send]]
=== Send IDoc

`<sap:send>`

Sends an IDocument to SAP over an RFC.

An RFC can be one of two types for IDocuments:

* Transactional (tRFC) - A tRFC is a special form of asynchronous Remote Function Call (aRFC). Transactional RFC ensures transaction-like handling of processing steps that were originally autonomous. tRFC is an asynchronous communication method that executes the called function module in the RFC server only once, even if the data is sent multiple times due to some network issue.
+
The remote system need not be available at the time when the RFC client program is executing a tRFC.  The tRFC component stores the called RFC function, together with the corresponding data, in the SAP database under a unique transaction ID (TID). tRFC is similar to an aRFC as it does not wait at the target system (Similar to a registered post).
+
If the system is not available, it writes the Data into aRFC Tables with a transaction ID (SM58) which is picked by the scheduler RSARFCSE (runs every 60 seconds). Use tRFC to extend an asynchronous RFC for secure communication between systems.
* Queued (qRFC) - A queued RFC is an extension of tRFC that ensures that individual steps are processed in sequence. Use to guarantee that multiple LUWs (logical unit of work transactions) are processed in the order specified by the application. A tRFC can be serialized using queues (inbound and queues). Hence the name queued RFC (qRFC). Use qRFC to extend the transactional RFC defined processing sequence. Implement qRFC to guarantee that several transactions are processed in a predefined order.

[[repeatable-in-memory-stream]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Stream

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | The amount of memory to allocate to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can fit into this buffer, then the buffer expands according to the bufferSizeIncrement attribute, with an upper limit of maxInMemorySize. |  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | By how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer should not expand, meaning that a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised when the buffer gets full. |  |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | The maximum amount of memory to use. If more than that is used then a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised. A value lower than or equal to zero means no limit. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which all these attributes are expressed. |  |

[[repeatable-file-store-stream]]
=== Repeatable File Store Stream

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max In Memory Size a| Number | Defines the maximum memory that the stream should use to keep data in memory. If more than that is consumed, then it starts to buffer the content on disk. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which maxInMemorySize is expressed. |  |

[[RedeliveryPolicy]]
=== Redelivery Policy

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Redelivery Count a| Number | The maximum number of times a message can be redelivered and processed unsuccessfully before triggering process-failed-message. |  |
| Use Secure Hash a| Boolean | Whether to use a secure hash algorithm to identify a redelivered message. |  |
| Message Digest Algorithm a| String | The secure hashing algorithm to use. If not set, the default is SHA-256. |  |
| Id Expression a| String | Defines one or more expressions to use to determine when a message has been redelivered. This property may only be set if useSecureHash is false. |  |
| Object Store a| Object Store | The object store where the redelivery counter for each message is going to be stored. |  |

_Premium_

The SAP connector enables the integration of data to and from SAP NetWeaver-based and external systems. MuleSoft maintains this connector under the Premium support policy, and requires a separate license. Contact mailto:sales@mulesoft.com[MuleSoft] to evaluate or use this connector in production.

Mule runtime supports SAP integration through our Anypoint Connector for SAP, an SAP-certified Java connector that leverages the SAP Java Connector (JCo) libraries, thus allowing Mule applications to:

. Execute BAPI functions over the RFC protocol, supporting the following types:
    * Synchronous RFC (sRFC)
    * Transactional RFC (tRFC)
    * Queued RFC (qRFC)

. Act as a JCo Server to be called as a BAPI over sRFC, tRFC and qRFC.

. Send IDocs over tRFC and qRFC.

. Receive IDocs over tRFC and qRFC.

. Transform SAP objects (JCo Function/BAPI & IDocs) to and from XML.

== SAP JCo Architecture

SAP JCo facilitates communication between an SAP backend system and a Java application. It allows Java programs to connect to SAP systems and invoke Remote Function Modules. It also allows parsing of IDocs (SAP Intermediate Documents), among other object types. Both inbound and outbound communications are supported.

*	Java API: handles dynamic metadata lookup and caching. It implements `JCO.Function`, which is the container for parameters and/or tables for the SAP Function Module (BAPI) in Java. Java apps are built on top of the Java API.

*	JNI (Java Native Interface): originally, SAP created libraries in C language to allow direct RFC calls to SAP, to manipulate data. JCo wraps C libraries in Java to provide platform-native access into the SAP system. RFC Middleware uses RFC Library through (JNI) Layer.

* RFC (Remote Function Call): communication with the SAP system is performed over the RFC protocol. RFC means calling BAPI or triggering IDoc processing that runs in another system as calling program. The RFC interface enables function calls between two SAP systems or between the SAP and external system.

*	RFC Library: libraries of C language-based functions to access the SAP system. RFC library is addressed by JNI.

* RFC Layer: SAP component that processes RFC calls.

*	SAP Java IDoc Class Library: provides structured, high-level interpretation and navigation of SAP IDocs in Java. It consists of the following add-on packages:
    - SAP Java Base IDoc Class Library: a middleware-independent library that provides a set of general base classes and interfaces for middleware dependent Java IDoc Class Library implementations.
    - SAP Java Connector IDoc Class Library: a middleware-independent library for creating, sending, and receiving IDocs.

*	FM (Function Module): Function modules are procedures that are defined in the ABAP language of SAP. It allows the encapsulation and reuse of global functions in the SAP System.

*	BAPI (Business Application Programming Interface): is the Function Module that fulfills certain design criteria, such as:
    - Implements a method of a SAP Business Object.
    - Maintains a static interface through different versions of the SAP system.
    - Is remote-enabled.
    - Runs to completion with or without user interaction.
    - Handles errors.

*	IDoc (Intermediate Document): standard SAP format for electronic data interchange between SAP systems. Different messages types (such as delivery notes or purchase orders) generally correspond to different special formats, known as IDoc types. Multiple message types with related content can, however, be assigned to a single IDoc type.

*	ALE (Application Link Enabling): technology for setting up and operating distributed applications. ALE facilitates distributed, yet integrated, installation of SAP systems. This involves business-driven message exchange using consistent data across loosely linked SAP applications. Applications are integrated through synchronous and asynchronous communication, rather than by use of a central database.

* SAP NetWeaver: one of the main technologies and application platforms used by SAP solutions. Its main component is the SAP Web Application Server (WebAS), which provides the runtime environment for SAP applications like ERP, CRM, SCM, PLM, SRM, BI. Other components include enterprise portal, exchange infrastructure, master data management and mobile infrastructure. SAP NetWeaver is an umbrella term for these technical components.

The SAP connector uses the RFC protocol to connect to NetWeaver Application Servers (NWAS). http://www.cipherbsc.com/solutions/sap-erp-central-component-erp-ecc/[ECC] and https://help.sap.com/crm[CRM] run on top of NWAS, as other SAP solutions do, hence any customer using the connector may access those systems.

SAP NetWeaver runs on both Java and ABAP stacks.

* ABAP (Advanced Business Application Programming): this is SAP's proprietary programming language and part of the NetWeaver platform for building business applications.

[[prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

This document assumes you have:

* A working knowledge of the SAP business context and in particular, the SAP R/3 Business Suite.
* A basic understanding of the SAP NetWeaver Platform from an administration point of view.
* Some fundamental knowledge of the ABAP language.

== Namespace and Schema

The required namespace and schema location for the SAP connector should be included in the header area of your Mule application.

[[requirements]]
=== Requirements

This connector requires the following SAP libraries:

* Java Connector (JCo) library
* IDoc library

*Note:* The JCo library depends on your hardware platform and operating system. Therefore, you need to download the proper version for the local drive running Anypoint Studio.

Three files are required for both libraries:

* Two multi-platform Java libraries:

    - `sapjco3.jar`
    - `sapidoc3.jar`

* One of the JCo platform-specific native libraries:

    - `sapjco3.dll` (Windows)
    - `libsapjco3.jnilib` (Mac OS X)
    - `libsapjco3.so` (Linux)

IMPORTANT: Do _not_ change the names of any of the SAP JCo library files from their original names, as they aren’t recognized by JCo. Since JCo 3.0.11, the JAR file cannot be renamed from `sapjco3.jar`, nor can it be repackaged. Read more about xref:sap-connector-troubleshooting.adoc[SAP Troubleshooting].

The SAP JCo libraries are OS-dependent. Therefore, make sure to download the SAP libraries that correspond to the OS and hardware architecture of the host server on which Mule is running. If you deploy to a platform different from the one used for development, you must change the native library before generating the zip file.

[[dependencies]]
=== Dependencies

There are four versions of the SAP connector that have been released, which depend on certain versions of Mule.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|SAP Connector Version|Compatible Mule Version

[[install-and-config]]
== Installing and Configuring

The SAP connector is bundled within Anypoint Studio: typically, the latest version of Studio comes with the latest version of the SAP connector. If you require another version of the connector in Anypoint Studio or must reinstall it:

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio taskbar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange.
. Search for the connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

When Studio has an update, a message displays in the lower right corner, which you can click to install the update.

[[install]]

The SAP connector needs JCo libraries to operate. The current section explains how to set up Mule so that you can use the SAP connector in your Mule applications.

This procedure assumes that you already have a Mule runtime instance installed on your host machine.

*Note*: Throughout this document, `$MULE_HOME` refers to the directory where Mule is installed.

. Download the SAP JCo and IDoc libraries from the https://websmp201.sap-ag.de/public/connectors[SAP Service Marketplace (SMP)]. To do so, you  need a `SAP User ID` (also called `S-User ID`).
Once you have those libraries, head over to the SAP Java Connector section of the SMP. Files are available at the Tools & Services subsection of the SMP.
+
For further details, read https://support.sap.com/en/index.html[SAP JCo 3.0 Release And Support Strategy - Support Note 1077727 (requires that you log into the SAP support portal)].
+
. Make sure that the SAP JARs are available to your Mule application and/or Mule instance. JCo relies on a native library, which requires additional installation steps.

If you plan to use SAP as an inbound endpoint, that is where Mule is called as a BAPI or receives IDocs, you must perform additional configurations within the services file at the OS level. A detailed explanation of the requirements can be found at xref:sap-connector-advanced-features.adoc#server-services-configuration[SAP JCo Server Services Configuration].


=== Adding the SAP Connector to the Classpath

Specifying the location of the SAP connector in your system `classpath` enables you to run/debug your project locally and to create custom Java code in your project that uses the classes.

The first time you try to add any of the SAP components to your Mule configuration file, the SAP dependencies that match the version of the project runtime get added automatically. If there is more than one SAP transport dependency for the Mule runtime configured in the project, then you are prompted to select the one you want to use, the newest, oldest, or select Choose manually.

To add the SAP connector manually to the classpath, complete the following steps:

. Right-click the top of the project in the Package Explorer panel.
. Select Build Path > Add Libraries.
. Select the library type Anypoint Connectors Dependencies and click Next.
. From the list, check the SAP extension you require, noting the version of the connector and the Mule runtime version requirements.

image::sap-extension.png[add sap extension]

[[config]]
=== Configuring

To use the SAP connector in your Mule application, you must first configure a global SAP element.

Read more about xref:3.9@mule-runtime::global-elements.adoc[Global Elements].

[[config-global]]
==== Setting up the Global Element

The SAP connector object holds the configuration properties that allow you to connect to the SAP server. When an SAP connector is defined in a Global Element, all SAP endpoints use its connection parameters; otherwise each SAP endpoint uses its own connection parameters to connect to the SAP server.

To create a configuration for an SAP connector, complete the following steps:

. Click the Global Elements tab below the Message Flow canvas.
. Click Create, then click the arrow icon to the left of Connector Configuration.
. Select SAP from the drop-down list of available connectors, then click OK.
. In the Global Elements Properties pane, enter the required parameters for defining an SAP connection, which your SAP system administrator should supply.

The SAP Global Element Configuration allows you to define connection properties as well as to easily add the required SAP dependencies to your project.

For ease of use, the SAP connector only shows the most common properties as connector parameters. To configure a property that is not listed in the Properties panel, consult the <<Extended Properties>> section.

image::sap-connector-global-element.png[sap conn global element]

The minimum required attributes you must define are:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|Name| The name of the connector used by the SAP endpoints in your project.
|DataSense| Enable (or disable) the DataSense feature by selecting the checkbox.
|AS Host| The URL or IP address of the SAP system.
|User | Username of an authorized SAP user.
|Password| Password credential of an authorized SAP user.
|SAP System Number| System number used to connect to the SAP system.
|SAP Client| The SAP client ID (usually a number) used to connect to the SAP system.
|Login Language| The language to use for the SAP connection. For example, `EN` for English.
|===

An in-depth explanation of these properties can be found in the <<Configurable Properties>> section.

*Tip*: As a best practice, use property placeholder syntax to load the credentials in a more simple and reusable way. Read more about property placeholders at xref:3.9@mule-runtime::configuring-properties.adoc[Configuring Properties].

Finally, click the Test Connection button to verify that the connection to the SAP instance succeeded. If the credentials are correct you should receive a _Test Connection Successful_ message.

[[config-libs]]
==== Adding the SAP Libraries

As explained in the <<Requirements>> section, the SAP connector requires the platform-dependent SAP JCo Native library as well as the multi-platform JCo and IDoc libraries.

Perform the following steps for each of the required libraries:

. Click the Add File button.
. Navigate to the location of the file and select it.
. Make sure a green tick appears next to the loaded library.

image::sap-libs-ok.png[SAP Required Dependencies]

The SAP libraries are automatically added to the project's `classpath`.

*Important*:

* If you are adding the JCo libraries and configuring the classpath manually using a version of SAP JCo later than SAP JCo 3.0.11, the `sapjco3.jar` and the corresponding native library must be in different directories for Datasense to work.
* If you are using a Mavenized app, the native library should be named `libsapjco3` followed by the extension according your OS.

[[config-extended-props]]
==== Extended Properties

To define extended properties for the SAP connector global element, complete the following steps:

. Navigate to the Advanced tab on the Global Elements Properties pane.
. Locate the Extended Properties section at the bottom of the window.
. Click the plus icon next to the Extended Properties drop-down menu to define additional configuration properties.

image::sap-connector-global-element-advanced-tab.png[sap global element adv tab]

You can provide additional configuration properties by defining a Spring bean global element representing a Map (`java.util.Map`) instance. This can be used to configure SCN (Secure Connections) or advanced pooling capabilities, among other properties.

*Important*: For this to work you must set the property name, as defined by SAP, in your configuration. Check xref:sap-connector-advanced-features.adoc#jco-extended-properties[SAP JCo Extended Properties] for the complete list of properties.

[[upgrading]]
== Upgrading From 2.x.x to 3.0.0

The SAP Connector can be updated via the integrated Update function within Mule Studio.

The main change introduced in SAP 3.0.0 is the removal of XML parser Version 1. From now on, Version 2 is the one and only supported format. Consequently, to move smoothly from V1 to V2, the following modifications are needed:

=== In SAP Endpoints and Transformers

Attribute `xmlVersion` is deprecated and no longer needed in SAP flows. Projects using `xmlVersion="1"`  fail but those using `xmlVersion="2"` are still compatible. The same applies to SAP transformers such as SAP Object to XML, XML to SAP Function (BAPI) and XML to SAP IDoc. Details below:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow>
    <!-- Recommended (NO xmlVersion declared) -->
    <sap:outbound-endpoint type="function" ... />
    <sap:object-to-xml doc:name="SAP Object to XML"/>

    <!-- Compatible -->
    <sap:outbound-endpoint xmlVersion="2" type="function" ... />
    <sap:object-to-xml xmlVersion="2" doc:name="SAP Object to XML"/>

    <!-- Invalid -->
    <sap:outbound-endpoint xmlVersion="1" type="function" ... />
    <sap:object-to-xml xmlVersion="1" doc:name="SAP Object to XML"/>

    <!-- same approaches apply to remaining SAP transformers -->
</flow>
----

=== In XML Definitions

Replace the `jco` node:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jco name="Z_BAPI_MULE_EXAMPLE">
    ...
</jco>
----

With the Function/BAPI name:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<Z_BAPI_MULE_EXAMPLE>
    ...
</Z_BAPI_MULE_EXAMPLE>
----

Elements `import`, `export`, `tables` and `exceptions` nodes remain the same.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<import>
    <!-- import params -->
</import>
<export>
    <!-- export params -->
</export>
<tables>
    <!-- table params -->
</tables>
<exceptions>
    <!-- exceptions params -->
    <exception key="EXCEPTION_KEY" />
</exceptions>
----

Replace `field` and `structure` nodes with their name attributes.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<import>
    <field name="MATERIAL">999</field>
    <structure name="MATERIAL_EVG">
        <field name="MATERIAL_EXT"/>
        <field name="MATERIAL_VERS"/>
        <field name="MATERIAL_GUID"/>
    </structure>
    <field name="PLANT">1111</field>
    <field name="VALUATIONAREA"/>
    <field name="VALUATIONTYPE"/>
</import>
----

To create:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<import>
    <MATERIAL>999</MATERIAL>
    <MATERIAL_EVG>
        <MATERIAL_EXT/>
        <MATERIAL_VERS/>
        <MATERIAL_GUID/>
    </MATERIAL_EVG>
    <PLANT>1111</PLANT>
    <VALUATIONAREA/>
    <VALUATIONTYPE/>
</import>
----

Replace child elements of `table` with its name attribue and remove the `id` from every `row`.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<tables>
    <table name="MATNRSELECTION">
        <row id="0">
            <field name="SIGN">I</field>
            <field name="OPTION">CP</field>
        </row>
    </table>
</tables>

<tables>
    <MATNRSELECTION>
        <row>
            <SIGN>I</SIGN>
            <OPTION>CP</OPTION>

[[sap-transformers]]
=== SAP Transformers

The SAP endpoints receive and transmit SAP objects, which must be transformed to and from XML within your Mule flow. MuleSoft bundles three SAP transformers specifically designed to handle such transformation:

* SAP Object to XML
* XML to SAP Function (BAPI)
* XML to SAP IDoc

These are available in the Transformers group on the Studio Palette. Typing "sap" in the filter input textbox above the palette should display both the SAP Connector and the SAP Transformers:

image::sap-connector-pallete.png[sap pallete results]

Click and drag the SAP Object to XML transformer after an SAP inbound endpoint (or a SAP outbound endpoint if the endpoint is a function and expects a response).

*Important*: With the option to enable DataSense on the SAP endpoint came a new attribute,`outputXml`. The default value, `false`, ensures that the output produced by the endpoint is XML instead of a Java object. However, if you set this value to `true` in order to output a Java Object, avoid the subsequent use of an SAP Object to XML transformer.

Click and drag the XML to SAP Function (BAPI) or the XML to SAP IDoc transformers before your SAP outbound endpoint within your Mule application flow.

The input to the outbound endpoint can be both the SAP Object created by the XML to SAP Function (BAPI) or the XML to SAP IDoc as well as any type (String, byte[] or InputStream) that represents the XML document.

As mentioned before, in order to avoid using the SAP Object to XML you can now use the `outputXML` attribute set to `true` at the endpoint level (works for both inbound and outbound SAP endpoints).

[[xml-definitions]]
=== XML Definitions

All SAP objects (BAPIs and IDocs) can be represented as XML documents for ease of use. IDocs are already XML documents by nature and the schema can be obtained with SAP transaction WE60.

The SAP connector bundles <<SAP Transformers>> that convert the XML documents exchanged between the endpoints and SAP into the corresponding SAP objects ready to be handled by the endpoints.

*Note*: With DataSense support, the recommended way to generate the XML definitions is using xref:3.9@mule-runtime::dataweave.adoc[DataWeave]. However, if you are using a Mule 3.3 application, see xref:6@studio::datamapper-user-guide-and-reference.adoc[DataMapper].

For BAPIs, the SAP Connector offers a proprietary format fully compatible with DataWeave and DataMapper.

[[jco-function]]
==== JCo Function

A JCo Function represents a Function or BAPI and consists of the following elements:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|`IMPORT` |Contains input values (arguments) when executing a BAPI/Function.
|`EXPORT` |Contains output values after executing a BAPI/function.
|`CHANGING` |Contains changing values that can be sent and/or received when executing BAPIs/functions.
|`TABLES` |Contains tables whose values can be used for input and output.
|`EXCEPTIONS` |When retrieving the BAPI metadata, contains all the exceptions the BAPI can throw. When sending the response back to SAP in the inbound endpoint, if an ABAP exception should be returned, then it should be sent in an exception element child of this one.
|===

==== BAPI XML Structure

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Z_BAPI_MULE_EXAMPLE>
    <import>
        <!-- Fields / Structures / Tables -->
    </import>
    <export>
        <!-- Fields / Structures / Tables -->
    </export>
    <changing>
        <!-- Fields / Structures / Tables -->
    </changing>
    <tables>
        <!-- Tables -->
    </tables>
    <exceptions>
        <!-- Errors -->
        <exception/>
    </exceptions>
</Z_BAPI_MULE_EXAMPLE>
----

Each of the main records (import, export and changing) support fields, structures and/or tables:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|`STRUCTURE` |Contains fields, tables and/or inner structures.
|`TABLE` |Contains a list of rows.
|`TABLE ROW` |Contains fields, structures and/or inner tables.
|`FIELD` |The only element that contains an actual value.
|===
Field elements allow, since version 1.4.1 and 2.1.0, a special attribute named `trim` which holds a boolean value indicating whether the value of the field should be trimmed (remove leading and trailing space characters) or not. The default behavior is to trim the value (`trim="true"`).

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<Z_BAPI_MULE_EXAMPLE>
    <import>
        <ATTR_1>   VAL-1 </ATTR_1> <!-- Trims ==> "VAL-1" -->
        <ATTR_2 trim="false">  VAL-2  </ATTR_2> <!-- No trim ==> "  VAL-2  " -->
        <ATTR_3 trim="true"> VAL-3</ATTR_3> <!-- Trims  ==> "VAL-3" -->
    </import>
    ...
</Z_BAPI_MULE_EXAMPLE>
----

*Note*: The trim attribute is valid in all XML versions. The example above uses XML version 2.

Exceptions are represented the same way in all XML versions as well. The result of a metadata retrieval method shows a list of exceptions a function module (BAPI) can throw.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<Z_BAPI_MULE_EXAMPLE>
    ...
    <exceptions>
        <exception key="EXCEPTION_1" messageClass="" messageNumber=""
        messageType="">Message 1</exception>
        <exception key="EXCEPTION_2" messageClass="" messageNumber=""
        messageType="">Message 2</exception>
        <exception key="EXCEPTION_3" messageClass="" messageNumber=""
        messageType="">Message 3</exception>
        <exception key="EXCEPTION_4" messageClass="" messageNumber=""
        messageType="">Message 4</exception>
    </exceptions>
</Z_BAPI_MULE_EXAMPLE>
----

The exception element is also used when an ABAP exception needs to be returned to SAP by the inbound endpoint. In this case _only one_ exception should be present. If more than one exception is returned, then the first one is thrown and the rest are ignored.

There are two constructors for the ABAP exception and the XML varies depending on which one you want to call:

* `new AbapException(String key, String message)`
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<Z_BAPI_MULE_EXAMPLE>
    ...
    <exceptions>
        <exception key="EXCEPTION_1">Message 1</exception>
    </exceptions>
</Z_BAPI_MULE_EXAMPLE>
----
+
* `new AbapException(String key, String messageClass, char messageType, String messageNumber, String[] messageParameters)`
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<Z_BAPI_MULE_EXAMPLE>
    ...
    <exceptions>
        <exception key="EXCEPTION_2" messageClass="THE_MESSAGE_CLASS" messageNumber="1000" messageType="E">
            <param>Param 1</param>
            <param>Param 2</param>
            <!-- Max 4 params -->
        </exception>
    </exceptions>
</Z_BAPI_MULE_EXAMPLE>
----
+
You can use the SAP outbound endpoint with type `function-metadata` to retrieve the XML template for a given function module (BAPI):
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<mule ...>
    <flow name="retrieveMetadata">
        <!-- inbound endpoint -->
        <sap:outbound-endpoint type="function-metadata" functionName="#[payload.bapiName]" />
        <sap:object-to-xml/>
    </flow>
</mule>
----
+
Here, `functionName` holds a Mule Expression (MEL), which returns the name of the function module. For IDoc templates, use operation `idoc-metadata` instead.

[[xml-version-2]]
==== XML Version 2

This XML version was added to provide a better option for the xref:6@studio::datamapper-user-guide-and-reference.adoc[Anypoint DataMapper] tool. It has the same general structure as the XML version 1, but the name of the XML element is the actual name of the field, structure or table and the type is provided as an attribute.

*Important*: XML version 2.0 is the default version since SAP connector v2.1.0, and it is the only supported version from SAP connector v3.0.0 onward.

[[use-cases-and-demos]]
=== Use Cases and Demos

Generally speaking, there are two main scenarios to use the SAP Connector within a Mule application:

* Inbound scenario: the connector receives IDoc or BAPI data from a SAP system into your Mule application. To use the connector in this mode, you must place a SAP Endpoint element into your flow and configure it by setting either the type `IDoc` (to receive data in SAP IDoc format) or `Function / BAPI` (to receive data from BAPI).

* Outbound scenario: the connector pushes data into the SAP instance by executing a BAPI or sending IDocs over RFC. To use the connector in this mode, simply place the SAP Endpoint into your flow at any position after an Inbound Endpoint.

Four basic examples for integrating SAP systems are listed below.

*Note*: Some settings may vary in your SAP instance depending on how it has been customized. Values used in these demo scenarios are based on SAP ERP IDES (International Demonstration and Education System), which is a pre-configured system that covers the most common SAP deployment modules and scenarios.

[[inbound-scenario-idoc]]

== 1. Inbound Scenario - IDoc - Using the Studio Visual Editor

Uses a SAP inbound endpoint that acts as an IDoc server. The JCo server needs to register against the SAP instance. For this reason, it requires both client and server configuration attributes. This example receives data in SAP IDoc format.

image::user-manual-68938.png[SAP Inbound IDoc Flow]

. Drag and drop the SAP Connector from the connector palette to the beginning of your flow.
. Double-click the SAP icon to open the Endpoint Properties pane and configure the following properties:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field | XML Attribute |Value
|Display Name |`doc:name` |`SAP`
|Exchange Pattern |`exchange-pattern` |`request-response`

|===
+
image::sap-outbound-idoc-settings.png[SAP Outbound IDoc Settings]
+
. Place a DataWeave component between the HTTP and SAP endpoints to build the IDoc. Since the IDoc is a nested structure, DataWeave may not display all fields, as in this example:
+
[source,text,linenums]

----
+
.. Add the missing fields by editing the mapping in the Transform Message component.

== 4. Outbound Scenario - BAPI - Using the Studio Visual Editor

Uses the SAP outbound endpoint to send data from a Mule application to SAP where the data is processed by a BAPI function.

image::sap-connector-outbound-bapi-flow.png[SAP Outbound BAPI Flow]

. Drag and drop a HTTP Endpoint from the connector palette to the beginning of your flow.
. Next to it, place the SAP Connector element.
. Double-click the SAP icon to open the Endpoint Properties pane and configure the following properties:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field | XML Attribute |Value
|Display Name |`doc:name` |`SAP`
|Exchange Pattern |`exchange-pattern` |`request-response`
|Connector Configuration |`connector-ref` |`SapConnector`
|Type |type |`Function / BAPI`
|Object Name |`functionName` |for example, `BAPI_USER_GETLIST`
|RFC Type |`rfcType` |`Synchronous RFC (sRFC)`
|Output XML |`outputXml` |`enabled (checked)`
|===
+
image::sap-outbound-bapi-settings.png[SAP Outbound BAPI Settings]
+
. Place a DataWeave component between the HTTP and SAP endpoints. Since the IDoc is a nested structure, DataWeave may not display all fields, as in this example:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
%dw 1.0
%output application/xml

{
    "BAPI_USER_GETLIST": {
        import: {

        export: {
        },
        tables: {
        }
    }
}
----
+
. The resulting XML should look like the following:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<BAPI_USER_GETLIST>
    <import>
        <MAX_ROWS>5</MAX_ROWS>
        <WITH_USERNAME/>
    </import>
</BAPI_USER_GETLIST>
----
+
. Add a Logger component at the end of the flow to display the results obtained by the BAPI in a web browser.

[[best-practices]]
== Best Practices

Read the following sections on best practices for designing and configuring your applications that use the SAP Connector.

=== Design Tips

To get the most out of what the SAP Connector has to offer, design-time best practice indicates that you should build an application in this particular order:

. Configure the connector.
. Test the connection.
. Initiate DataSense metadata extraction.
. Build the rest of your flow.
. Add and configure DataMapper | DataWeave.

=== Use DataSense

If you intend to employ an SAP endpoint in conjunction with a xref:6@studio::datamapper-user-guide-and-reference.adoc[DataMapper] or xref:3.9@mule-runtime::dataweave-language-introduction.adoc[DataWeave] transformer to map and transform data, you can make use of Anypoint Studio's xref:6@studio::datasense.adoc[DataSense] functionality.

. Follow the detailed xref:6@studio::datasense.adoc[DataSense] instructions to drop the endpoint into your flow, then xref:6@studio::testing-connections.adoc[test the connection] to SAP using the SAP Connector.
. In your flow, define the Object Name in the endpoint which should be the complete name of the BAPI or IDoc. You can also follow the instructions in the following section to find the BAPI or IDoc.
. For a more DataMapper-friendly experience, use the XML Version selector to select `XML Version 2` `(DataMapper)`. `XML Version 1` is functional, but the mapping experience is inferior to that available with version 2.
. Drop a DataMapper into your flow, before or after the SAP endpoint, then click the DataMapper transformer to display the DataMapper properties editor. Having collected metadata from SAP, Mule automatically prescribes the input or output (relative to the position of the SAP endpoint to DataMapper) to use in mapping and transforming data.
. Define specific mappings to or from SAP, then save your flow.

=== Share JCo Dependencies Between Several Applications

Follow the instructions provided by SAP to install the JCo libraries, but remember that certain JAR files must be located in your application `CLASSPATH`, and the dynamic link library (`dll/so/jnilib`) must reside in your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

The connector and JCo JAR files must be in your application `CLASSPATH` and share the same directory:

* `mule-transport-sap-{version}.jar`
* `sapjco-3.0.x.jar`
* `sapidoc-3.0.x.jar`

If you're deploying multiple applications to the same server, keep all of the JARs in a single folder rather than having them repeated for each app. Mule does not support this out of the box, but there's a workaround for that.

For the SAP connector, MuleSoft recommends storing the JARs in the following directories:

* `$MULE_HOME/lib/user`
* `$MULE_HOME/lib/native`

By placing the libraries in those, you share them among all applications running within the same Mule instance. As SAP JCo configuration is a singleton, if you go this way, then all your applications shares the same configuration, including the JCo destination repository.

For this setup to work, you must also manually configure the `wrapper.conf` file to add support for the `$MULE_HOME/lib/native` directory.

What you did so far is enough to run this in a Mule Standalone instance, however to make this run properly in the Anypoint Studio runtime and be able to test your app while developing it, you must do the following:

* Add the following command line argument to the JRE Default VM Arguments `-Djava.library.path=PATH`. This handles the native library
* Modify your POM to include the `<scope>provided</scope>` for supporting the file `mule-transport-sap-{version}.jar`

== About the Application CLASSPATH

Your application lib directory is automatically enabled to support dynamic libraries. If you are not including them there, then you also need to tell Mule where the SAP JCo dynamic linked library resides. To accomplish this, you can do either of the following:

* Configure the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable.
* Configure the Mule wrapper configuration file `$MULE_HOME/conf/wrapper.conf` by adding the line `wrapper.java.library.path.{N}=PATH/TO/SAP-JCO/LIB-DIR`.

Do _not_ combine both strategies, such as putting JCo libraries in the Mule instance shared lib directory, (for example, `$MULE_HOME/lib/user`) and the SAP connector library inside your application (for example, `$MULE_HOME/apps/YOUR_APP/lib`). This causes classloader issues since JCo libraries hold configuration in static fields (singletons).

[[tips]]
== Tips

=== Finding the SAP object

Since the release of Mule Runtime 3.5.0 and SAP Connector 2.2.2, Studio allows searching for BAPIs or IDocs.

. Double-click the SAP endpoint to open the properties editor.
+
image::user-manual-30730.png["scaledwidth="70%",SAP Object Settings]
+
. Specify the SAP object Type to search.
. Click the Select button to open the SAP Function search wizard.
+
image::user-manual-9fce3.png["scaledwidth="70%",SAP Object Search]
+
. Type a valid filter (at least one character should be typed in). You can use the wildcard asterisk (`&#42;`) to search for all BAPIs/IDocs that "begin with" that function name.
. Once results are displayed, you can right-click each row to export the XML or XSD representation of the BAPI (XML version 1 or 2) or IDoc. When a row in the result is selected, you can then press the Select button to set the value of the Object Name.
+
image::sap-tip-object-export.png["scaledwidth="70%",SAP Object Export]
+
. Additionally, you can click the Details button (next to the Object Name) to display the XML structure and XSD definition for that particular BAPI or IDoc. And, eventually, you can export those definitions by clicking the Export option.

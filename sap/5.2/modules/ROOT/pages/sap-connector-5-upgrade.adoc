= Upgrade to SAP Connector 5.x - Mule 4
:page-aliases: connectors::sap/sap-connector-5-upgrade.adoc

Anypoint Connector for SAP version 5.x has enhancements and changes. Some of the main changes introduced in SAP Connector 5.x are:

* The `Create` operation is renamed to `Retrieve IDoc`.
* The execute BAPI functions over qRFC, tRFC, and sRFC operations are merged into Synchronous Remote Function Call (sRFC) and Asynchronous Remote Function Call (aRFC) operations.
* The `Disable function template cache` flag is renamed to `Disable JCo internal cache`, and applies to both functions and sources. The default value is `false`.
* The sources now have `-listener` in their aliases instead of `source`. For example, the XML is changed from `sap:document-source` to `sap:document-listener`.
* The SAP configuration has the following changes:
   * The SAP Inbound and SAP Outbound configurations are merged into the new SAP configuration.
   * The *Message Server* field is now in the *General* tab. +
The new configuration makes understanding what configuration to use in the connector more intuitive.

These new features and enhancements may cause backward compatibility issues.

== Upgrade Steps

Follow these steps to perform the upgrade:

. In Anypoint Studio, create a Mule project.
. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Dependencies to Project*, enter `sap` in the search field.
. In *Available modules*, select *SAP Connector - Mule 4* and click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.
. Verify that the SAP Connector dependency version is 5.x.x in the `pom.xml` file in the Mule project, where `x.x` is the minor release and patch version number. For example, if you are upgrading to v5.2, the dependency version in the pom.xml file should be 5.2.0.

Studio upgrades the connector automatically.

After you install the latest version of the connector, follow these steps to verify the upgrade:

. In Studio, verify that there are no errors in the *Problems* or *Console* views.
. Verify that there are no problems in the project `pom.xml` file.
. Test the connection to verify that the operations work.

=== Revert the Upgrade

If it is necessary to revert to the previous version of SAP Connector, change the `sap-connector` dependency version in the project's `pom.xml` file to the previous version.

= SAP Connector 5.2 - Mule 4

Support Category: Support Category: https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#anypoint-connectors[Premium]

Anypoint Connector for SAP (SAP Connector) enables the integration of data to and from external systems based on SAP NetWeaver.

SAP Connector is not available in the Design Center feature of Anypoint Platform.

This connector requires a separate license. Contact MuleSoft to evaluate or use this connector in production.

Mule runtime engine (Mule) supports SAP integration through Anypoint Connector for SAP, an SAP-certified Java connector that leverages the SAP Java Connector (JCo) libraries. SAP JCo facilitates communication between an SAP backend system and a Java application. It allows Java programs to connect to SAP systems and invoke Remote Function Modules. It also allows the parsing of IDocs (SAP Intermediate Documents), among other object types. The SAP configuration supports both inbound and outbound communications.

The SAP JCo libraries enable Mule apps to:

* Execute BAPI functions over the following types of RFC protocols:
** Synchronous Remote Function Call RFC (sRFC)
** Asynchronous Remote Function Call RFC (aRFC)
* Act as a JCo server to be called as a BAPI over sRFC and aRFC
* Send IDocs over tRFC and qRFC
* Receive IDocs over tRFC and qRFC
* Transform SAP objects (JCo function for BAPI and IDocs) to and from XML

See xref:sap-connector-terminology.adoc[SAP Terminology] to understand SAP acronyms.

== Before You Begin

To use this connector, you must be familiar with:

* The SAP Connector's API
* Anypoint Connectors
* Mule runtime engine (Mule)
* Elements and global elements in a Mule flow
* Creating a Mule app using Anypoint Studio (Studio)

Before creating an app, you must have:

* Credentials to access the SAP target resource
* A working knowledge of the SAP business context and, in particular, the SAP R/3 Business Suite
* A basic understanding of the SAP NetWeaver Platform from an administration point of view
* Knowledge of the ABAP language
* An SAP ID to download the required SAP libraries
* Use of the RFC protocol to connect to NetWeaver Application Servers (NWAS) +
http://www.cipherbsc.com/solutions/sap-erp-central-component-erp-ecc/[ECC] and https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/SAP_CUSTOMER_RELATIONSHIP_MANAGEMENT[CRM] run on top of NWAS, as other SAP solutions do, so any customer using the connector can access those systems.
* Knowledge of how to create a Mule app using Anypoint Studio

Before creating an app, browse to the SAP web site and download the version 3.0.18 libraries
for IDoc, JCO, and JCO Native to a folder on your computer.

Studio 7 can use the library formats directly without conversion.

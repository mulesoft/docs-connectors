= SAP Connector 5.9 Reference - Mule 4
:page-aliases: connectors::sap/sap-connector-reference.adoc

Anypoint Connector for SAP (SAP Connector) enables the integration of data to and from external systems based on SAP NetWeaver.

[NOTE]
Starting with version 5.0, SAP Connector also supports connecting to an on-premises instance of SAP S/4HANA.

== Limitations

* For SAP Connector versions 5.4.0 and earlier, multiple servers deployed on the same Mule runtime engine with the same PROGRAM_ID, GATEWAY_SERVICE, and GATEWAY_HOST cannot be created by the JCo library. If you attempt to create two servers with the same PROGRAM_ID, GATEWAY_SERVICE, and GATEWAY_HOST, only one server is created. To work around this, you can use two different Mule runtime engines or use the same PROGRAM_ID with two different GATEWAY_HOSTs.
* SAP Connector does not support Bitronix Transaction Manager.
* The *Document Listener* and *Function Listener* sources do not support Mule transactions. Although the *Transactional action* and *Transaction type* parameters (on the *Advanced tab*) are available for both sources, the transactional feature is not implemented.
* The reconnection strategy on SAP Listeners (*Document Listener* and *Function Listener*) relies exclusively on the JCo library, which means that the Mule reconnection mechanism has no impact on reconnections.
* The JCO Server that runs in the background manages the reconnection when there is a connection issue. The JCo RFC provider recognizes a communication error between the Java server and the ABAP gateway and attempts to reconnect. If the first reconnection fails, the next reconnection attempt occurs after waiting for one second. If the reconnection fails again, the reconnection wait time doubles from one second to two seconds, until eventually it reaches the default maximum waiting period of 3600 seconds, or one hour. Set the maximum reconnection timeout using the `-Djco.server.max_startup_delay=<reconnect delay in seconds>` JMV parameter.

[[asyncRfc]]
=== Asynchronous Remote Function Call (Deprecated)
`<sap:async-rfc>`

This operation is deprecated. Use the <<asynchronousRemoteFunctionCall, *Asynchronous Remote Function Call*>> operation instead.

This operation works only with JCo 3.0.x.

Executes a BAPIFunction over a queued Remote Function Call (qRFC).

A qRFC is an extension of a transactional RFC (tRFC) that ensures that individual steps are processed in sequence. This guarantees that multiple logical unit of work (LUW) transactions are processed in the order specified by the application.

tRFC can be serialized using inbound and outbound queues, hence the name queued RFC. qRFC is best used as an extension of tRFC to define a processing sequence. Use qRFC to guarantee that several transactions are processed in a predefined order.

[[asynchronousRemoteFunctionCall]]
=== Asynchronous Remote Function Call
`<sap:asynchronous-remote-function-call>`

This operation works only with JCo 3.1.x and expects valid XML content in the response.

Executes a BAPIFunction over a queued Remote Function Call (qRFC) and throws an `SAP:INVALID_INPUT` error when the provided payload is invalid according to JCo library checks.

A qRFC is an extension of a transactional RFC (tRFC) that ensures that individual steps are processed in sequence. This guarantees that multiple logical unit of work (LUW) transactions are processed in the order specified by the application.

[[send]]
=== Send IDoc
`<sap:send>`

Sends an IDoc to SAP over an RFC. An RFC can be one of two types for IDocs:

* Transactional (tRFC)
+
A special form of asynchronous Remote Function Call (aRFC). tRFC ensures transaction-like handling of processing steps that were originally handled autonomously. tRFC is an asynchronous communication method that executes the called function module in the RFC server only once, even if the data is sent multiple times due to a network issue. The remote system does not need to be available at the time the RFC client program is executing a tRFC. The tRFC component stores the called RFC function,  along with the corresponding data, in the SAP database under a unique transaction ID (TID). tRFC is similar to aRFC since it does not wait at the target system (similar to a registered post). If the system is not available, the data is written into aRFC tables with a transaction ID (SM58) that is chosen by the scheduler RSARFCSE and runs every 60 seconds. tRFC is best used as an extension of asynchronous RFC secure communication between systems.

* Queued (qRFC)
+
An extension of tRFC. qRFC ensures that individual steps are processed in sequence. Use qRFC to guarantee that multiple LUWs (Logical Unit of Work transactions) are processed in the order specified by the application. tRFC can be serialized using inbound and outbound queues, hence the name queued RFC (qRFC). qRFC is best used as an extension of tRFC to define a processing sequence. Implement qRFC if you want to guarantee that several transactions are processed in a predefined order.

Both tRFC and qRFC have a TID handler.

[[syncRfc]]
=== Synchronous Remote Function Call (Deprecated)
`<sap:sync-rfc>`

This operation is deprecated. Use the <<synchronousRemoteFunctionCall, *Synchronous Remote Function Call*>> operation instead.

This operation works only with JCo 3.0.x.

Executes a BAPIFunction over a synchronous Remote Function Call (sRFC). sRFC requires both the systems (client and server) to be available at the time of communication or data transfer. sRFC is the most common type and is used when a result is required immediately after the execution of sRFC. sRFC is a means of communication between systems where acknowledgments are required.

The resources of the source system wait at the target system and ensure that they deliver the message or data with ACKD. The data is consistent and reliable for communication. If the target system is not available, the source system resources wait until the target system is available. This can lead to the processes of the source system going into Sleep/RFC/CPIC mode at the target systems, which blocks these resources. Use sRFC for communication between systems, and communication between an SAP web application server and an SAP GUI.

[[synchronousRemoteFunctionCall]]
=== Synchronous Remote Function Call 
`<sap:synchronous-remote-function-call>`

This operation works only with JCo 3.1.x and expects valid XML content in the response.

Executes a BAPIFunction over a synchronous Remote Function Call (sRFC) and throws an `SAP:INVALID_INPUT` error when the provided payload is invalid according to JCo library checks. sRFC requires both the systems (client and server) to be available at the time of communication or data transfer. sRFC is the most common type and is used when a result is required immediately after the execution of sRFC. sRFC is a means of communication between systems where acknowledgments are required.

The resources of the source system wait at the target system and ensure that they deliver the message or data with ACKD. The data is consistent and reliable for communication. If the target system is not available, the source system resources wait until the target system is available. This can lead to the processes of the source system going into Sleep/RFC/CPIC mode at the target systems, which blocks these resources.

[[repeatable-file-store-stream]]
=== Repeatable File Store Stream

Configures the repeatable file-store streaming strategy by which Mule keeps a portion of the stream content in memory. If the stream content is larger than the configured buffer size, Mule backs up the buffer's content to disk and then clears the memory.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| In Memory Size a| Number | Maximum amount of memory that the stream can use for data. If the amount of memory exceeds this value, Mule buffers the content to disk. To optimize performance:

* Configure a larger buffer size to avoid the number of times Mule needs to write the buffer on disk. This increases performance, but it also limits the number of concurrent requests your application can process, because it requires additional memory.

* Configure a smaller buffer size to decrease memory load at the expense of response time. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | Unit for the *In Memory Size* field. |  |
|===

[[repeatable-in-memory-stream]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Stream

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | Initial amount of memory to allocate to the data stream. If the streamed data exceeds this value, the buffer expands by *Buffer Size Increment*, with an upper limit of *Max In Memory Size value*. |  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | Amount by which the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of `0` or lower specifies that the buffer can't expand. |  |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | The maximum amount of memory to use. If more than that is used then a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised. A value lower than or equal to zero means no limit. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | Unit for the *Initial Buffer Size*, *Buffer Size Increment*, and *Buffer Unit* fields. |  |
|===

[[SapAttributes]]

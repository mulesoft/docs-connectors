Set connector-specific values for the following variables:

* {exchange-search-name} - Lower case term used to find the connector in Exchange. For example, redis.
* {connector-name} - Name of the connector without the word "Connector." For example, Redis.
* {version} - Connector version. For example, 1.0.
* {lc-connector-name} - Lower case connector name to use in the links in the Next Steps and See Also sections. For example, redis.
* {studio-connector-name} - Name of the connector as it appears in the Available modules section in the Studio Add Dependencies to Project window. For example, NetSuite Connector - Mule 4.

You can configure one of these sources to use with {connector-name} Connector:

If the connector has connector-specific sources, list them first, using one bullet for each source. If the connector has only one source, do not use a list.

////
Use one source as an example. If the connector has a connector-specific source, use one of those sources as an example. In the example, list the required and important fields.  If the connector does not have a connector-specific source, use *HTTP > Listener*, using the partial shown below.

. In the *General* tab, in *Connection*, select the authentication method to configure:
* <link to authentication method config section>
* <link to authentication method config section>

////
The wording of step 3 depends on how many authentication methods the connector uses. If the connector uses only one authentication method, mention it in step 3 and then explain how to configure it in this procedure. If the connector uses multiple authentication methods, mention them in step 3 and then refer to subsections that explain how to configure the authentication methods.

Example of wording for Basic authentication. This varies by connector.

[[basic_authentication]]
=== Basic Authentication

Enter the following information in the *General* tab of the *Global Element Properties* screen to configure Basic authentication:

[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Field |User Action
|Name |Enter the configuration name.
|Connection | Select *Basic*.
|Session Token | Optionally enter the session token provided by Amazon Security Token Service (STS).
|Access Key | Enter the access key provided by Amazon.
|Secret Key | Enter the secret key provided by Amazon.
|Try Default AWS Credentials Provider Chain | Set to `true` to obtain credentials from the AWS environment.
|Region Endpoint | Select the region endpoint for the service.
|===

The following image shows an example of configuring Basic authentication:

image::<image>.png["Basic is selected in the Connection section and authentication fields are completed in the General tab"]

The first item shows where to specify that the connector uses Basic authentication. The second item shows the *General* tab, which contains fields related to Basic authentication.
////

== Configure Additional Connector Fields

include::connectors::partial$t-studio-partial.adoc[tags=config-additional-fields]

//// (Remove this comment and the end comment to have the table render correctly.)
Optionally, use a table like this one to describe the required fields for the connector configuration. For some connectors, you might also want to list important, non-required fields.

[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|Table name | Name of the table to create
|Attribute definitions | Attributes that describe the key schema for the table and its indexes
|Key schemas | Attributes compose the primary key for a table or index

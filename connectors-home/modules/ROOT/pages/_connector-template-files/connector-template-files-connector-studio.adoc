Set connector-specific values for the following variables:

* exchange-search-name - Lower case term used to find the connector in Exchange. For example, redis
* lc-connector-name - Lower case connector name to use in the namespace code and POM file. For example: redis
* connector-name - Name of the connector without the word "Connector." For example, Redis

[[configure-global-element]]
== Configure a Global Element for the Connector

When you configure a connector, configure a global element that all instances of that connector in the app can use. Configuring a global element requires you to provide the authentication credentials that the connector requires to access the target <Connector name> system. <Connector name> Connector supports <mention the types of authorization the connector supports>.

To configure the global element for <Connector name> Connector, follow these steps:

. Select the operation in the Studio canvas.
. In the *General* configuration screen for the operation, click the *Add* icon (image:add-icon.png[2%,2%]) to access the global element configuration fields.
. In the *General* tab, in *Connection*, select the authentication method to configure:
* <link to authentication method config section>
* <link to authentication method config section>
//The wording of step 3 depends on how many authentication methods the connector uses. If the connector uses only one authentication method, mention it in step 3 and then explain how to configure it in this procedure. If the connector uses multiple authentication methods, mention them in step 3 and then refer to subsections that explain how to configure the authentication methods.
+
You can reference a configuration file that contains ANT-style property placeholders (recommended), or you can enter your authorization credentials in the global configuration properties. For information about the benefits of using property placeholders and how to configure them, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-connector-configuration-overview.adoc[Anypoint Connector Configuration].
. In the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.


//Example of wording for Basic authentication. This varies by connector.

////
[[basic_authentication]]
=== Basic Authentication

Enter the following information in the *General* tab of the *Global Element Properties* screen to configure Basic authentication:

[%header,cols=30s,70a]
|===
|Field |User Action
|Name |Enter the configuration name.
|Connection | Select *Basic*.
|Session Token | Optionally enter the session token provided by Amazon Security Token Service (STS).
|Access Key | Enter the access key provided by Amazon.
|Secret Key | Enter the secret key provided by Amazon.
|Try Default AWS Credentials Provider Chain | Set to `true` to obtain credentials from the AWS environment.
|Region Endpoint | Select the region endpoint for the service.
|===

The following image shows an example of configuring Basic authentication:

image::<image>.png[*Basic* is selected in the *Connection* section and authentication fields are completed in the *General* tab.]

The first item shows where to specify that the connector uses Basic authentication. The second item shows the *General* tab, which contains fields related to Basic authentication.

Example of wording for Role authentication (this example is for Amazon connectors only)

[[role-authentication]]
=== Role Authentication

Enter the following information on the *General* tab of the global element configuration screen to configure Role authentication:

[%header,cols=30s,70a]
|===
|Field |User Action
|Name |Enter the configuration name.
|Connection | Select `Role`.
|Role ARN | Enter the role to assume to gain cross-account access.
|Access Key | Enter the access key provided by <Connector name>.
|Secret Key | Enter the secret key provided by <Connector name>.
|Try Default AWS Credentials Provider Chain | Set to `true` to obtain credentials from the AWS environment.
|Region Endpoint | Select the region endpoint for the service.
|===

The following image shows an example of configuring Role authentication:

image::<image>.png[*Role* is selected in the *Connection* section and authentication fields are completed in the *General* tab.]

The first item shows where to specify that the connector will use Role authentication. The second item shows the *General tab*, which contains fields related to Role authentication.
////

[[configure-other-fields]]
== Configure Additional Connector Fields

After you configure a global element for <Connector name> Connector, configure the the other required fields for the connector. The required fields vary depending on which connector operation you use.

Use a table like this one to describe the required fields for the connector configuration. For some connectors, you might also want to list important, non-required fields.

[%header,cols=30s,70a]
|===
|Field |Description
|Table name | Name of the table to create
|Attribute definitions | Attributes that describe the key schema for the table and its indexes
|Key schemas | Attributes compose the primary key for a table or index
|===


[[view-app-log]]
== View the App Log

To check for problems, you can view the app log as follows:

* If you’re running the app from Anypoint Platform, the app log output goes to the Anypoint Studio console window.
* If you’re running the app using Mule from the command line, the app log output goes to your operating system console.

Unless the log file path is customized in the app’s log file (`log4j2.xml`), you can also access the app log in the default location `MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`. You can configure the location of the log path in the app log file `log4j2.xml`.

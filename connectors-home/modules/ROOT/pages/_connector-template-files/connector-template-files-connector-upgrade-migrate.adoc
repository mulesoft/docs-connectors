== Requirements

Ensure that you meet these requirements before you perform the upgrade:

// * Any particular database, OS version, etc?
// * Any software requirements? 
// * Minimum hardware requirements (CPU, memory, disk space, etc)?
// * Licensing requirements?

== Limitations

Before you perform the upgrade, be aware of these known limitations:

// (Examples) 
// * There is no rollback mechanism
// * A protocol will be broken
// * Migration of _____ is not supported

== Upgrade Prerequisites

Before you perform the upgrade, you must complete the following:

* Create a backup of your files, data, and configurations in case you need to restore to them. 
// * Do they need to rename or copy over any files before downloading the latest version?

== Upgrade Steps

Follow these steps to perform the upgrade:

. In Anypoint Studio, create a Mule project.
. In *Mule Palette*, click *Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Dependencies to Project*, enter `connector-template-files` in the search field.
. In *Available modules*, select *<Connector name>* and click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.
. Verify that the <Connector name> Connector `<dependency>` version is <latest-version> in the `pom.xml` file in the Mule project.

Studio upgrades the connector automatically.

// * Download the current version. 
// * Import data?
// * Update the configuration.
// * What does the user need to do after downloading the connector before they can start using it?

== Post Upgrade Steps

After you install the latest version of the connector, follow these steps to complete the upgrade:

// * Do they need to update endpoints? 
// * Do they need to re-create/refactor any customizations?
// * Does the user need to map any files?
// * Verify the upgrade.

=== Verify the Upgrade

After you install the latest version of the connector, verify the upgrade:

. In Studio, verify that there are no errors in the *Problems* or *Console* views.
. Verify that there are no problems in the project `pom.xml` file.
. Test the connection to verify that the operations work.

== View the App Log

To check for problems, you can view the app log as follows:

* If you’re running the app from Anypoint Platform, the app log output is visible in the Anypoint Studio console window.
* If you’re running the app using Mule from the command line, the app log output is visible in your OS console.

Unless the log file path is customized in the app’s log file (`log4j2.xml`), you can also view the app log in the default location `MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`.

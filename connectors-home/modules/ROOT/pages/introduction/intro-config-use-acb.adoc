= Using Anypoint Code Builder to Configure a Connector

To use Anypoint Code Builder to configure a connector:

* <<create-integration-project,Create a basic integration project>> in Anypoint Code Builder.
* <<add-connector-to-project,Add connectors>> and other components to your Mule application to process your business logic.
* <<configure-trigger,Configure the connector's trigger>>. 
* <<configure-component-attributes,Configure the connector's operations>>.  

[[before-you-begin]]
== Before You Begin

Before creating an integration project, you must:

* xref:anypoint-code-builder::start-acb.adoc[Set up and access the Anypoint Code Builder web or desktop IDE.]
* Have credentials to access the connector's API.

To use connectors, you must be familiar with:

* The connectorâ€™s API
* Anypoint Connectors
* Mule runtime engine (Mule)

After you complete the prerequisites, you are ready to create an app and configure the connector by using Anypoint Code Builder.

[%header,cols="20a,60a"] 
|===
| Attribute | Value

| *Project Name* | Unique name for your project.

This name is used as the title and name of the integration project file.
For example, if the project name is "Salesforce Integration," the project file name is `salesforce-integration`.
| *Project Location* | Your home directory or another directory you create. Click *Browse* to select a different directory for the integration project.

Don't create the project within another project directory.

See xref:anypoint-code-builder::start-add-folders.adoc[].

. Click *Create Project*.
// end::acb-create-integration-project[]

[[add-connector-to-project]]
== Add the Connector to Your Integration Project

Anypoint Connectors provide operations for retrieving, modifying, and sending data to and from systems.

In addition to the xref:anypoint-code-builder::acb-components.adoc#builtin-connectors[built-in connectors] that Anypoint Code Builder provides,
you can download many other connectors from Anypoint Exchange.

To import a connector from Exchange and add it to your configuration:

. In the Explorer view, open the configuration XML file for your project, such as `my-project-name.xml`.
. Click the image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-tree-view.png["Show Mule graphical mode icon",15,15] (*Show Mule graphical mode*) icon in the activity bar to open the canvas UI if it doesn't open automatically.
. Add the connector the same way you added other components from the canvas UI:
.. In the canvas UI, click the image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-plus.png["Add Component icon",15,15] (*Add component*) icon.
.. In the *Add Component* panel, click *Connectors*.
.. Click the connector name and then click the operation to add, such as *Publish*:
+
image:anypoint-code-builder::int-add-connector-operation.png["Add Publish operation from the Anypoint MQ Connector"]
+
If the connector is not available locally, click the image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-search-exchange.png["Search in Exchange icon",15,15] (*Search in Exchange*) toggle:
+
image:anypoint-code-builder::int-connector-search-exchange.png["Search in Exchange toggle"]
+
--
[calloutlist]
. Search locally
. Search in Exchange
--
.. Select the connector to add to your project.
.. Select the operation from the *Add Component* panel.

Adding a connector to an integration project does not make that connector available to other projects in your Anypoint Code Builder workspace.

[[creating-config-file]]
== Creating a Configuration File

A configuration file is a YAML file that references other configurations and specifies values for your connector's properties. Define the configuration properties based on the environment that you are deploying your application to.

. In the *Explorer* view, right-click the *resources* folder (`src/main/resources`) and select *New File*.
. Name the file `config.yaml`.
. Populate your file with the connection properties required to connect to your connector. The following shows examples of Salesforce, Gmail, and Slack connection properties:
+
[source,YAML]
--
salesforce:
 username: "yourUserName"
 password: "yourPassword"
 token: "yourToken"

email:
 host: "smtp.gmail.com"
 username: "yourGmailEmail"
 password: "yourEmailAppPassword"

slack:
 token: "yourSlackToken"
--
. Navigate to your project XML, add a new line before the `</mule>` tag, type `configuration`, and select *mule:configurationProperties*:
+
image::anypoint-code-builder::select-mule-config-properties-contacts-sync.png["List of components with an arrow pointing to the mule:configurationProperties component"]
. Scroll through the attributes and set the value of `file` to `config.yaml`:
+
[source,XML]
--
<configuration-properties file="config.yaml" doc:name="Configuration properties" />
--

=== Salesforce Connector Configuration Example

Use the values in your `config.yaml` file to connect Salesforce Connector to your Salesforce environment:

. In your project XML file, create a new line after the `<configuration-properties/>` element, type `salesforce`, and select *salesforce:sfdc-config*.
. Set the *name* field to `Salesforce-Config`.
. Create a new line, type `basic`, and select *Salesforce:Basic*.
. Configure the `username` and `password` properties to use your configuration file values:
+
[source,XML]
--
<salesforce:basic-connection username="${salesforce.username}" password="${salesforce.password}" securityToken="${salesforce.token}" />
--
+
[NOTE]
--
When you move your cursor over the `${salesforce.username}` and `${salesforce.password}` elements, Anypoint Code Builder shows the values from the configuration file.
--
. Click *Test Connection* for the `<salesforce:sfdc-config/>` element to verify your connection to Salesforce:
+
image::anypoint-code-builder::sync-api-sfdc-test-connection.png["Arrow pointing to the Test Connection option in the connection XML"]
+
Anypoint Code Builder returns a *Connection is valid* message.
+
If you get an error, check the error message to troubleshoot further. For more information, see xref:anypoint-code-builder::troubleshooting.adoc[Troubleshooting Anypoint Code Builder].


[[configure-trigger]]
== Configuring a Trigger for the Flow

A trigger (source) starts the flow when specified conditions are met. If a connector has its own associated sources, you can use a connector-specific trigger to initiate the flow. Each connector trigger has a unique configuration.

=== Configuring HTTP Listener

To use HTTP Listener as a trigger for the flow:

. Click the *Listener* component on the canvas.
. (Optional) Click the edit icon to change the name of the *Listener* component. 
. (Optional) If you created a configuration file for the connector, select it. 
. In the *General* tab, in the *Path* field, enter the relative path for the path set in the HTTP configuration element. See xref:http/http-listener-ref.adoc#configure-paths[Configure Paths]. 
. Select the *Advanced* tab to configure the following attributes:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Attribute | Description | Required
|Allowed methods |To allow all HTTP methods (default), do not define this attribute. To restrict specific methods, specify the allowed HTTP methods in a comma-separated format, for example, `POST,GET`. | No
| Response streaming mode a| Whether to use streaming when the response is sent. When HTTP Connector manages response bodies, the connector considers the type of data to send and uses _chunked_ encoding when the body size is not clear. This causes streams with no size information. To control this behavior, select any of these options:

* *AUTO (default)* +
Uses `Content-Length` encoding if a size is defined for the body, otherwise uses `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`.
* *ALWAYS* +
Uses `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` regardless of any size data present.
* *NEVER* +
Uses `Content-Length` encoding, consuming streams if necessary to determine the data size. | No
| Output MIME type | MIME type of the payload that this component outputs. | No
|Parameters | Appends a key-value pair for a reader property to the value of the Output MIME attribute. Multiple key-value pairs are allowed.  | No
| Output encoding | Encoding of the payload that this component outputs. | No
|Streaming Strategy | Configures the way data streams are consumed in Mule apps. This attribute is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See <<configuring-streaming-strategy>>. | No
|Primary node only |If selected, executes the *Listener* trigger on the primary node only when the app is running in a cluster. | No
|Redelivery policy |Configures the redelivery policy for executing requests that generate errors. You can add a redelivery policy to any source in a flow. This attribute is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See xref:http/http-documentation.adoc#RedeliveryPolicy[Redelivery Policy]. | No
|Reconnection strategy |When an operation in a Mule application fails to connect to an external server, the default behavior is for the operation to fail immediately and return a connectivity error. You can modify the default behavior by configuring the reconnection strategy for the operation. This attribute is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See xref:http/http-documentation.adoc#reconnect[Reconnect], xref:http/http-documentation.adoc#reconnect[Reconnect Forever], and <<configuring-reconnection-strategy>>. | No
| Response |Attributes that contain the metadata associated with the body (or payload) of the message. For more information, see xref:http/http-documentation.adoc#HttpResponseAttributes[HTTP Response Attributes]. | No
| Error Response | If selected, the HTTP error response returns a status code for the error. | No
|Body | Body of the error message. | No
|Headers a|Headers to include in the error message. Each header attribute is a key-value pair separated by an equal sign (=), for example:  

[source,text,linenums]

[[using-connector-specific-trigger]]
=== Using a Connector-Specific Trigger

If a connector has associated triggers, you can use a connector-specific trigger to initiate the flow. Each connector trigger has a unique configuration.

For example, you can configure one of these triggers to use with Salesforce Connector:

* *On Deleted Object*
+
Initiates your app when a Salesforce user deletes an object. Possible object types are `Contact`, `Lead`, `Account`, `Contracts`, `Opportunity`, or the name of a custom object.
+
* *On Modified Object*
+
Initiates your app when a Salesforce user modifies an object. Possible object types are `Contact`, `Lead`, `Account`, `Contracts`, `Opportunity`, or the name of a custom object.
+
* *On New Object*
+
Initiates your app when a Salesforce user creates a new object. Possible object types are `Contact`, `Lead`, `Account`, `Contracts`, `Opportunity`, or the name of a custom object.
+
* *Replay channel listener*
+
Subscribes to a streaming channel. This source provides channel-related notification settings for new events and events stored by Salesforce within the 24-hour retention period. Events that occur in the specified channel source trigger the flow.
+
* *Replay topic listener*
+
Subscribes to a topic. This source provides topic-related notification settings for new events and events stored by Salesforce within the 24-hour retention period. Events that occur on records in the specified topic trigger the flow.
+
* *Subscribe channel listener*
+
Subscribes to a streaming channel. This source provides channel-related notification settings for new events that occur after you subscribe.
+
* *Subscribe topic listener*
+
Subscribes to a topic. This source provides topic-related notification settings for new events that occur after you subscribe.

[NOTE] 
A channel or topic must be published to Salesforce before a subscription to the channel can be created.

For example, to configure the *On New Object* source:

. Add the *On New Object* component to the canvas.
. Click the *On New Object* component on the canvas. 
. In the *General* tab, select the configuration file to use, and configure the following attributes:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Attribute | Description | Required
|Object type | Salesforce object type. | Yes
|Triggers query |Query that filters the trigger results, for example, `Name='Filter'`. | No
|Since | Date in the `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss` format, for example, `2017-03-17 16:30:40`. If this field is empty, this source retrieves the selected objects from the time the Mule app started.| No
|Scheduling strategy |Triggers the flow's execution based on a time-based condition. This attribute is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See <<use-scheduler-trigger>>.| Yes
|===

. Select the *Advanced* tab to configure the following attributes:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Attribute | Description | Required
| Primary node only |Executes the *On New Object* trigger only on the primary node when the app is running in a cluster if selected. | No
| Redelivery policy | This attribute is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See xref:salesforce/salesforce-connector-reference.adoc#RedeliveryPolicy[Redelivery Policy] | No
|Read timeout | How long the consumer waits for a response before it times out. | No
| Time unit a| Time unit for the *Read timeout* attribute. Enumeration, one of:

* NANOSECONDS
* MICROSECONDS
* MILLISECONDS
* SECONDS
* MINUTES
* HOURS
* DAYS | No
|Reconnection strategy |This attribute is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See xref:salesforce/salesforce-connector-reference.adoc#reconnect[Reconnect] and xref:salesforce/salesforce-connector-reference.adoc#reconnect-forever[Reconnect Forever], and <<configuring-reconnection-strategy>>. | No
|===

[[configure-component-attributes]]
== Configure the Component Attributes

After you add components to your integration project, configure the attributes in the component UI, or configure the attributes directly in the XML code editor. 

Connector XML tags start with a namespace followed by an operation, following the syntax `namespace:operation`, such as `<db:select/>` for a *Select* operation in Anypoint Connector for Database (Database Connector).

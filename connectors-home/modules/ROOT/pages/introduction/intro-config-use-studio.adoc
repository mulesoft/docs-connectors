To configure the global element for {connector-name} Connector, follow these steps:

. Select the operation in the Studio canvas.
. In the configuration screen for the operation, click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to access the global element configuration fields.
. On the *General* tab, in *Connection*, select the authentication method to configure:
* <link to authentication method 1>
* <link to authentication method 2, etc.>

////
The wording of step 3 depends on how many authentication methods the connector uses. If the connector uses only one authentication method, mention it in step 3 and then explain how to configure it in this procedure. If the connector uses multiple authentication methods, mention them in step 3 and then refer to subsections that explain how to configure the authentication methods.

Use one input source as an example. If the connector has a connector-specific input source, use one of those input sources as an example. In the example, list the required and important fields.  If the connector does not have a connector-specific input source, use HTTP Listener, using the text included below.

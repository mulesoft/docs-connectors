= Use Flow Designer to Configure a Connector

Anypoint Design Center's Flow Designer enables you to create apps visually. For more information, see the xref:design-center::fd-tour.adoc[Flow Designer Tour].

To create an app in Flow Designer:

. Configure the trigger (source) for the flow.
. Configure the target component.

[[configure-trigger]]
== Configure the Trigger For the Flow

. Log in to Anypoint Platform.
. Click *Start designing*.
. In Design Center, click *Create new*.
. Click *Create new application*.
. Enter a project name and click *Create*.
. Click *Go straight to canvas* to exit from *Let's get started*.
+
.Clicking *Go straight to canvas* takes you to a trigger card.
image::intro-config-fd-go-to-canvas.png[Exit from the Let's Get Started screen]
+
. Click the empty trigger card in the middle of the canvas to expand it.
. Configure one of these triggers for the connector:
* <<http-listener,HTTP Listener>>
* <<scheduler,Scheduler>>
* <<connector-specific,A connector-specific trigger>>

[[http-listener]]
=== Use HTTP Listener as a Trigger

`HTTP Listener` listens for HTTP requests on a specified path and initiates the flow when it receives a request. To use `HTTP Listener` as a trigger:

. Follow the procedure described in <<configure-trigger,Configure the Trigger For the Flow>>.
. In the *Search* field, enter `HTTP`.
. Click *HTTP Listener*.
. In the *Path* field, specify the path on which `HTTP Listener` listens for requests.
. Optionally, use the default CloudHub connection, use another existing connection, or configure a new one.

==== Use the Default CloudHub Connection

The default CloudHub connection uses host 0.0.0.0 and port 8081. To use this connection, click outside of the trigger card to close it after you enter the path.

==== Select Another Existing Connection

To select an existing connection other than the default CloudHub connection:

. Click *Edit* on the HTTP Listener trigger card:
+
.Clicking *Edit* takes you to a screen where you can configure the HTTP Listener connection.
image::intro-config-fd-exit.png[CLick Edit]
+
. Select the connection.
. Click *Save*.

==== Configure a New Connection

To configure a new connection:

. Click *Edit* on the HTTP Listener trigger card.
. Click *Add Connection*.
. In the *Connection Name* field, enter a connection name.
. In the *Connection Type* field, select *Listener*.
. Enter values for the *Host* and *Port* fields.
+
. Optionally, configure a reconnection strategy and TLS for the new connection.

For more information about configuring `HTTP Listener`, see the xref:http-connector::http-documentation.adoc[HTTP Connector Reference].

==== Configure a Reconnection Strategy and TLS for a New Connection

To configure a reconnection strategy and TLS while configuring a new connection:

. After you enter values for the *Host* and *Port* fields, scroll down and click *Advanced*.
. Optionally, enable the *Fails Deployment* field to force the deployment to fail if the connection fails and configured reconnection attempts are exhausted.
. In the *Reconnection Strategy* field, select a reconnection strategy.
. Complete the fields in the *Reconnection Strategy* section.
+
For example, this reconnection strategy does the following:
+
* Forces the deployment to fail if the connection fails and configured reconnection attempts are exhausted
* Limits the number of reconnection attempts to three at a frequency of every 5000 milliseconds (ms)
+
.Use the fields in the *Reconnection* section to specify reconnection options.
+

+
. To configure TLS, scroll down and specify the required information in the *TLS Configuration* section.
. Click *Save*.

For more information about the fields used to configure a reconfiguration strategy or TLS, see the xref:http-connector::http-documentation.adoc[HTTP Connector Reference].

[[scheduler]]
=== Use Scheduler as a Trigger

Use `Scheduler` to initiate a flow when a time-based condition is met. You can configure `Scheduler` to initiate a flow at a regular interval, or you can configure `Scheduler` to use a more flexible cron expression. A cron expression is a standard for specifying date and time information that initiates a specified action.

To use `Scheduler` as a trigger:

. Follow the procedure described in <<configure-trigger,Configure the Trigger For the Flow>>.
. In the *Search* field, enter `Scheduler`.
. Select *Scheduler*.
. In the *Scheduling Strategy* field, select whether you want to use a fixed frequency or cron expression to trigger the flow:
+
For example, the following configuration directs `Scheduler` to:

* Wait 10 seconds before initiating the flow for the first time after the app starts.
* Initiate the flow every 30 seconds after the initial 10-second delay.
+
.Select `Fixed Frequency` in the *Scheduling Strategy* field to initiate a flow at regular intervals.
image::intro-config-fd-scheduler-fixed.png[Configuration for a fixed scheduling strategy]
+

The following configuration uses a cron expression to initiate an action every second:
+
.Select `Cron` in the *Scheduling Strategy* field to use a cron expression to specify when to initiate a flow.

For more information about configuring `Scheduler`, see xref:mule-runtime::scheduler-concept.adoc[Scheduler Endpoint]


[[connector-specific-trigger]]
=== Use a Connector-Specific Trigger

If a connector has associated triggers, you can use a connector-specific trigger to initiate the flow. For example, if you are configuring an app that contains an Amazon SQS Connector operation, you can use the `Amazon SQS Receive Messages` trigger to initiate a flow each time the configured Amazon SQS queue receives a new message.

To start the configuration for a connector-specific trigger, follow these steps:

. Follow the procedure described in <<configure-trigger,Configure the Trigger For the Flow>>.
. In the *Search* field, search for and select the connector.
. If the connector has multiple triggers, select the trigger to use. (If it has one trigger, that trigger is selected automatically.)

Each connector-specific trigger has a unique configuration, but most configurations require the following actions:

* Completing the required fields
* Selecting an existing connection or configuring a new one

For more information about configuring a connector-specific trigger, see the reference guide for the associated connector.

== Configure the Target Component

After you configure a trigger for a connector, you can configure the connector as the target component (step order varies by connector):

. Click the *+* icon next to the trigger card.
+
.Clicking the *+* icon brings up a screen where you can select the target connector operation.
image::intro-config-fd-plus-target.png[Click the Plus Sign]
+
. In the *Select a component* screen, search for and select the target connector.
. Select the target operation.
. Select an existing connection configuration or add a new one.
. To add a new connection:
.. Click *Add Connection*.
.. Specify a connection name.
.. In the *Connection Type* field, select an authentication type.
.. Complete the required fields for the selected authentication type.
. Click *Test* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server using the configured authentication.
. Click *Save*.
. Complete the required fields, if any.
. Optionally, click *Advanced* to create a reconnection policy or expiration policy (options vary by connector).
. If you made additional configuration changes in steps 8 or 9, click *Save* again.

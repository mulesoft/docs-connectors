= Configuring OAuth 2.0 for Connectors

Many services enable you to use an OAuth 2.0 authentication scheme for increased security when interacting with their APIs. Many connectors support configuring a standard OAuth 2.0 setup.

== Prerequisites

To configure OAuth 2.0 for a connector, you must have access to the following:

* OAuth provider (Okta, Azure AD, Google, PingFederate, and so on)
* Anypoint Studio

== OAuth 2.0 Configuration Fields

Here are the configuration fields typically available for OAuth 2.0 for connectors:

*OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code:*

[%header,cols="20s,20a,35a,20a,5a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Consumer Key | String | OAuth consumer key, as registered with the service provider. | | X
| Consumer Secret | String | OAuth consumer secret, as registered with the service provider. | | X
| Authorization URL | String | URL of the service provider's authorization endpoint in which the user is redirected to provide their user credentials. This URL typically ends with `/authorize`. | | X
| Access Token Url | String | URL of the service provider's access token endpoint in which the app automatically exchanges an authorization code for an access token. | | X
| Scopes | String | Space-delimited list of OAuth scopes to request during the OAuth dance. This value defaults to the scopes in the annotation. | `offline_access` |
| Resource Owner ID | String | ID of the resource owner's account that authorizes the connector to access their resources. | |
|===

*OAuth 2.0 Callback Configuration:*

[%header,cols="20s,20a,35a,20a,5a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Callback Path | String | Server path to which the user's browser is redirected to after the OAuth provider successfully authenticates the user. The callback path is typically `/callback`. This configuration uses your *HTTP Listener* setup to build the callback path, for example, `\http://0.0.0.0:{port}/callback`. | | X
| Authorize Path | String | Server path in which the user begins the OAuth dance. The authorize path is typically `/authorize`. | | X
| External Callback Url | String | Full, publicly accessible URL on your server in which the user's browser is redirected to when authorization is successful with the OAuth provider. This field enables you to override the *Callback path* field, for example, `\http://my.server.com/callback`. | |
|===

== OAuth 2.0 Flow Overview

Anypoint Connectors use the Authorization Code Grant flow for their OAuth 2.0 dance. The following steps show a typical flow for configuring OAuth 2.0 for a connector:

. In your browser, navigate to the path specified in the *Authorize Path* field to begin the OAuth dance. For example, if you are running the connector on `localhost` and your path is set to `/authorize` with port `8080`, navigate to `\http://localhost:8080/authorize`.
. Provide values for the *Authorization URL*, *Scopes*, *Resource Owner ID*, and *Callback Path* fields. The following conditions must be true for the OAuth provider to accept the authorization request:
+
* The *Authorization URL* is reachable from the user's browser.
* The provided scopes for *Scopes* are supported.
* The *Resource Owner ID* (if provided) is registered with the OAuth provider.
* The full *Callback Path* is registered with the OAuth provider.
. Enter your username, password, and other credentials that the OAuth provider accepts, such as 2FA requests. If the authentication is successful, the OAuth provider might ask permission for the app to access your account. This typically occurs the first time you authenticate.
. Once the OAuth provider authenticates the user and authorizes access to the connector, the user's web browser is redirected to the callback URL that is registered with the OAuth provider, for example, `\http://localhost:8080/callback`.
+
Ensure that the user running the flow has access to the server and endpoint; otherwise, the authorization approval will not reach the connector.
+
You can use `localhost` for testing locally, but you cannot use `localhost` for production environments and cloud deployment. For example, if your connector app is running on `\http://my.server.com`, you must specify the *External Callback Url* field with the `\http://my.server.com/callback` value. The `\http://my.server.com/callback` URL must also be registered with the OAuth provider.
. Once the user's browser successfully reaches the callback URL, the connector obtains an authorization code that is automatically exchanged for an access token using the URL configured in the *Access Token URL* field. This token is long-lived and is automatically refreshed by the connector indefinitely (if allowed by the OAuth provider).

The connector is now fully authorized and can use any service that accepts the new access token issued by the OAuth provider.

== Example: How to Configure OAuth 2.0 For Gmail Connector

The following example shows how to configure OAuth 2.0 for Gmail Connector.

=== Configuring the OAuth Provider

To configure the OAuth provider for Gmail Connector, you can use Google Cloud Console. The following steps show how to configure the OAuth provider:

NOTE: If you haven't enabled the Gmail API previously, you must create a new project and enable the Gmail API in the *Enabled APIs & Services* menu section.

. Add a new client (your connector app) to Google OAuth 2.0. To do so, navigate to *APIs & Services > Credentials > Create Credentials > OAuth Client ID*.
. Create a new web application by using the *Web Application* field.
. Enter a name, for example, `OAuthDemoApp`.
. Add the following URL to the *Authorized redirect URIs* field: `\http://127.0.0.1:8080/callback`.
. Click *Create* and copy the new client ID and client secret for later use.
. Click *OK*.

=== Configuring the Connector

Configure the connector with OAuth 2.0 using Anypoint Studio or XML.

==== Configuring the Connector Using Anypoint Studio

The following steps show how to configure the connector with OAuth 2.0 using Anypoint Studio.

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. In the Mule Palette view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Dependencies to Project*, enter `gmail` in the search field.
. Click *Gmail Connector - Mule 4* in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.
. Configure the OAuth 2.0 authorization code. Create a new Gmail Connector connection and use the client ID and the client secret from the previous section as your *Consumer Key* and *Consumer Secret* respectively. You can leave the *Resource Owner ID* field empty.
+
NOTE: Gmail Connector comes with pre-filled values for the *Authorization URL*, *Access Token URL*, and *Scopes* fields, so no further action is required. However, if you are setting up a different connector that uses a third-party OAuth provider such as Okta or Ping, you must use their respective *Authorization URL*, *Access Token URL*, and *Scopes* fields.
+

+
. Configure the OAuth 2.0 callback configuration. Drag a new *HTTP Listener* to the message flow and set *Protocol* to `HTTP (Default)`, *Host* to `localhost`, and *Port* to `8080`.
+
image::intro-config-oauth2-gmail-http-listener.png["HTTP Listener Configuration window"]
+
. Select this *HTTP Listener* in the Gmail Connector connection configuration.
. Set *Callback path* to `callback` and *Authorize path* to `authorize`. You can leave the *External Callback Url* field empty.
+
image::intro-config-oauth2-gmail-callback.png["Gmail OAuth 2.0 Callback Configuration window"]
+
. Run the app.

==== Configuring the Connector Using XML

The following steps show how to configure the connector with OAuth 2.0 using XML.

. Add the following dependency into your pom.xml.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.mulesoft.connectors</groupId>
    <artifactId>mule4-gmail-connector</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.5</version>
    <classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
</dependency>
----
. Configure the OAuth 2.0 authorization code. Create a new Gmail Connector connection and use the client ID and the client secret from the previous section as your *Consumer Key* and *Consumer Secret* respectively. You can leave the *Resource Owner ID* field empty.
+
NOTE: Gmail Connector comes with pre-filled values for the *Authorization URL*, *Access Token URL*, and *Scopes* fields, so no further action is required. However, if you are setting up a different connector that uses a third-party OAuth provider such as Okta or Ping, you must use their respective *Authorization URL*, *Access Token URL*, and *Scopes* fields.
+
image::intro-config-oauth2-gmail-config.png["Gmail Connector Configuration window"]

. Configure the OAuth 2.0 callback configuration. Create a new *HTTP Listener* configuration and set *Protocol* to `HTTP (Default)`, *Host* to `localhost`, and *Port* to `8080`.
+
Here is the XML for this *HTTP Listener*:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<http:listener-config name="HTTP_Listener_config" >
		<http:listener-connection host="localhost" port="8080" />
</http:listener-config>
----
+
. Select this *HTTP Listener* in the Gmail Connector connection configuration.
. Set *Callback path* to `callback` and *Authorize path* to `authorize`. You can leave the *External Callback Url* field empty.
+
Here is the XML for the OAuth 2.0 callback configuration for Gmail Connector:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<gmail:config name="Gmail_Connector_Config" >
    <gmail:oauth2c-connection >
        <gmail:oauth-authorization-code consumerKey="YOUR_CLIENT_ID" consumerSecret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" />
        <gmail:oauth-callback-config listenerConfig="HTTP_Listener_config" callbackPath="callback" authorizePath="authorize"/>
    </gmail:oauth2c-connection>
</gmail:config>
----
+
. Run the app.

=== Performing the OAuth Dance

Perform the OAuth dance and authorize your app to access your Gmail account via the connector. The following steps show how to perform the OAuth dance:

. In your browser, navigate to the path specified in the *Authorize Path* field to begin the OAuth dance. In this example, the path is `\http://localhost:8080/authorize`. If everything is configured correctly, you will see a Google Authentication screen in which you select your user account and give permission to the app to access your account. Google shows a list of permissions that require approval, for example:
+
image::intro-config-oauth2-gmail-permissions.png["Window that asks the user permission for Gmail to access their account"]
+
NOTE: These permissions are dependent on the *Scopes* field configured in the Gmail Connector connection configuration. You can accept the defaults, but if you want to limit the access, you can remove the unwanted scopes. For example, remove the `\https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send` scope to disallow the connector from sending new emails from your account, however, doing so limits connector functionality, such as the ability to use the *Send Message* or *Send Draft* operations.
+
. Click *Allow*. The OAuth provider redirects you to `\http://127.0.0.1:8080/callback`, which is the redirect URI that you configured in the OAuth provider and is open in the connector configuration. If the OAuth dance is successful, a `Successfully retrieved access token` message shows up on the browser, which means the connector is now fully authorized and ready to use your Gmail account.
+
You do not need to authorize the app again unless you restart Anypoint Studio or the access token expires. Access tokens are automatically refreshed if the refresh token flow is enabled in your OAuth provider. Google supports this automatically, so your tokens are refreshed indefinitely.
+
NOTE: If you want your authorization to persist over restarts, you can configure an object store in the Gmail Connector connection configuration.

=== Testing the Connector

Now that your connector is functional and authorized, you can test a flow using the connector. The following steps show how to retrieve some of your emails:

. Drag an *HTTP Listener* to the flow. Set *Path* to `/messages`.
. Drag the *List Messages* operation to the flow. The only required field is *User Id*, which contains the user's email address that you want to access. For example, this is useful for corporate email servers with multiple users registered under one company account. Set *User Id* to `me` to retrieve emails from your main account directly. You can also set *Max Results* to a lower number if you want.
. Restart the project.
. Navigate to `\http://localhost:8080/messages`. You should see a JSON formatted list of message IDs and thread IDs. You can retrieve the details of these messages or threads using the *Get Message* or the *Get Thread* operations.

==== XML for this Example

Paste this code into the Studio XML editor to quickly load the flow for this testing example into your Mule app:

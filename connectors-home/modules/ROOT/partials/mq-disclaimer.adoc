// MQ Reconnection Strategy not supported
// tag::mqReconnectStrategy[]
Anypoint MQ Connector doesn't support this parameter.

// Prefetch mode disclaimers
// tag::mqPrefetchMode[]
Don't use `prefetch` mode in the following situations:

* Applications with long processing times that use the `maxConcurrency` attribute to limit concurrent processing.
+
These options can cause messages to remain in the buffer longer, which can result in the messages expiring and being sent back to the queue.
* When using FIFO queues
+
Because Anypoint MQ can't guarantee ordering when using `prefetch` mode, don't use it with FIFO queues.
+
Using `prefetch` mode for applications with long processing times can consume significant resources because Anypoint MQ monitors the ACK TTL for all messages in the local buffer and extends the TTL to avoid sending messages back to the queue.
// end::mqPrefetchMode[]

// MQ IMMEDIATE mode app restart note
// tag::mqImmediateAppRestart[]
If the app restarts between being acknowledged and dispatched, the message might not be available again because it was deleted from the queue.
To prevent message deletion until after processing, use the `AUTO` or `MANUAL` acknowledgment mode instead.
// end::mqImmediateAppRestart[]

// MQ Prefetch Issue note
// tag::mqPrefetchLatency[]
NOTE: Due to a known issue, using `prefetch` mode with `maxConcurrency="1"` set on the `flow` element might result in message-processing latency.
// end::mqPrefetchLatency[]

// MQ Prefetch maxLocalMessages
// tag::mqPrefetchMaxLocalMsgs[]
When using `prefetch` mode, set `maxLocalMessages` to a value greater than `1` to avoid message-processing latency issues.
When `maxLocalMessages` is set to `1`, latency can occur when the message is prefetched, not processed, and returned to the queue for reprocessing.

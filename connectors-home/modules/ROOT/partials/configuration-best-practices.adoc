//Used in Anypoint Connector Configuration doc and Application Design Best Practices template

* Use a global element to define configuration details that can be shared with other instances of the connector in the flow.
* Use property-value placeholders to configure a connector in Anypoint Studio or to configure the connector using XML outside the Studio editor.
* Configure a reconnection strategy to set the number of reconnection attempts to try after an initial failure.
* When you finish the configuration, test the connectivity before you deploy it.

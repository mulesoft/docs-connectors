tag::topic-intro[]
Although you can manually code a Mule app in XML, it is more efficient to use Anypoint Studio:

* If you manually code a Mule runtime engine (Mule) app in XML, either from the Anypoint Studio XML editor or from a text editor, you can access the connector from your app by adding reference statements to both your XML Mule flow and the Apache Maven `pom.xml` file.

* If you add the connector in Studio, Studio automatically populates the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location and it also adds a dependency to the `pom.xml` file.
end::topic-intro[]

tag::add-namespace[]
To add a namespace for a connector, paste the following code inside the `<mule>` tag of the header of your configuration XML, where `<connector>` is the connector name specified in the XML and Maven Support topic of the connector's User Guide:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/<connector>
http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/<connector>/current/mule-<connector>.xsd
----

This example shows how the namespace statements are placed in the `<mule>` XML block:
end::add-namespace[]

tag::pom-file[]
The Apache Maven `pom.xml` file generated by Anypoint Studio contains dependencies for a Mule app. If you code a Mule app manually, include this XML snippet in your `pom.xml` file to enable access to this connector:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>GROUP_ID_FROM_EXCHANGE</groupId>
  <artifactId>ARTIFACT_ID_FROM_EXCHANGE</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
</dependency>
----

Replace `GROUP_ID_FROM_EXCHANGE` and `ARTIFACT_ID_FROM_EXCHANGE` with correct information from Exchange.

Replace `x.x.x` with the version that corresponds to the connector you are using.

To obtain the most up-to-date `pom.xml` file information:

. Go to https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Anypoint Exchange].
. In Exchange, click *Login* and supply your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. In Exchange, search for `<connector-name>`.
. Select the connector.
. Click *Dependency Snippets* near the upper right of the screen.

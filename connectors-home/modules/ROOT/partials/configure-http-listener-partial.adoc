//Used in Cassandra Connector examples

This example uses variables for some field values. You can either:

* Replace the variables with their values in the code.
* Provide the values for each variable in a properties file and then refer to
that file from the connector configuration.

If you don't know how to use a properties file,
see xref:mule-runtime::mule-app-properties-to-configure.adoc[Configuring Property Placeholders].

To configure *HTTP Listener*:

. Create a new Mule project in Studio.
. In the *Mule Palette* view, search for `http` and select the *Listener* operation:
. Drag the *Listener* operation onto the canvas.
. In the *Listener* configuration, click the *Add* icon next to the *Connector configuration*
field to add a global element.
. Click *OK* to accept the defaults.

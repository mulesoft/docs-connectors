To use Anypoint Code Builder to configure a connector, create a basic integration project in Anypoint Code Builder, add connectors and other components to your Mule application to process your business logic, and configure attributes. 

== Before You Begin

Before creating an integration project, you must:

* xref:anypoint-code-builder::start-acb.adoc[Set up and access the Anypoint Code Builder web or desktop IDE]
* Have credentials to access the connector's API

To use this connector, you must be familiar with:

* The connector’s API
* Anypoint Connectors
* Mule runtime engine (Mule)

After you complete the prerequisites, you are ready to create an app and configure the connector using Anypoint Code Builder.

. Complete the *Develop an Integration* form.
+
[%header,cols="20a,60a"] 
|===
| Attribute | Value

| *Project Name* | Unique name for your project.

This name is used as the title and name of the integration project file.
For example, if the project name is "Salesforce Integration," the project file name is `salesforce-integration`.
| *Project Location* | Your home directory or another directory you create. Click *Browse* to select a different directory for the integration project.

Don't create the project within another project directory.

See xref:anypoint-code-builder::start-add-folders.adoc[].
|===
. Click *Create Project*.
// end::acb-create-integration-project[]


[[add-connector-to-project]]
== Add the Connector to Your Integration Project
// tag::acb-add-connector-to-project[]

Anypoint Connectors provide operations for retrieving, modifying, and sending data to and from systems.

In addition to the xref:anypoint-code-builder::acb-components.adoc#builtin-connectors[built-in connectors] that Anypoint Code Builder provides,
you can download many other connectors from Anypoint Exchange.

To import a connector from Exchange and add it to your configuration:

. In the Explorer view, open the configuration XML file for your project, such as `my-project-name.xml`.
. Click the image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-tree-view.png["",15,15] (*Show Mule graphical mode*) icon in the activity bar to open the canvas UI if it doesn't open automatically.
. Add the connector the same way you added other components from the canvas UI:
.. In the canvas UI, click the image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-plus.png["",15,15] (*Add component*) icon.
.. In the *Add Component* panel, click *Connectors*.
.. Click the connector name and then click the operation to add, such as *Publish*:
+
image:anypoint-code-builder::int-add-connector-operation.png["Add Publish operation from the Anypoint MQ Connector"]
+
If the connector is not available locally, click the image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-search-exchange.png["",15,15] (*Search in Exchange*) toggle:
+
image:anypoint-code-builder::int-connector-search-exchange.png["Search in Exchange toggle"]
+
--
[calloutlist]
. Search locally
. Search in Exchange
--
.. Select the connector to add to your project.
.. Select the operation from the *Add Component* panel.

Adding a connector to an integration project does not make that connector available to other projects in your Anypoint Code Builder workspace.
// end::acb-add-connector-to-project[]

[[configure-trigger]]
== Configure a Trigger for the Flow
// tag::acb-configure-source[]
A trigger (source) starts the flow when specified conditions are met. If a connector has its own associated sources, you can use a connector-specific trigger to initiate the flow. Each connector trigger has a unique configuration.

You can configure the following sources for this connector:

include::connectors::partial$t-studio-partial.adoc[tags=listener-scheduler-descriptions]

For example, to configure an HTTP Listener trigger, follow these steps:

. Click the *Listener* component on the canvas UI.
. (Optional) Click the edit icon to change the name of the *Listener* component. 
. (Optional) If you created a configuration file for the connector, select it. 
. In the *General* tab, in the *Path* field, enter the relative path for the path set in the HTTP configuration element. See xref:http-connector::http-listener-ref.adoc#configure-paths[Configure Paths]. 
. Select the *Advanced* tab to configure the following attributes:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Attribute | Description | Required
|Allowed methods |To allow all HTTP methods (default), do not define this attribute. To restrict certain methods, specify all allowed HTTP methods, for example, `GET, POST`, as a comma-separated list.  | No
| Response streaming mode | Whether to use streaming when the response is sent. | No
| Output MIME type | MIME type of the payload that this component outputs. | No
|Parameters | Appends a key-value pair for a reader property to the value of the Output MIME attribute. Multiple key-value pairs are allowed.  | No
| Output encoding | Encoding of the payload that this component outputs. | No
|Streaming Strategy | This attribute is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See <<configuring-streaming-strategy>>. | No
|Primary node only |Select this option to execute the *Listener* trigger on the primary node only when running in a cluster. | No
|Redelivery policy |This attribute is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See xref:http-documentation.adoc#RedeliveryPolicy[Redelivery Policy]. | No
|Reconnection strategy |This attribute is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See xref:http-documentation.adoc#reconnect[Reconnect], xref:http-documentation.adoc#reconnect[Reconnect Forever], and <<configuring-reconnection-strategy>>. | No
| Response |See xref:http-documentation.adoc#HttpResponseAttributes[HTTP Response Attributes]. | No
| Error Response | HTTP error response returns a status code for the error. | No
|Body | Body of the error message. | No
|Headers |Headers to include in the error message. | No
|Status code | Status code of the error response, for example, `500`. | No
|Reason phrase | Reason for the error, for example, `Gateway Timeout` or `Internal Server Error`. | No
|===

// end::acb-configure-source[]


[[add-components]]
== Add Components to Your Project
// tag::acb-add-components-to-project[]

Add components to your integration project to build a flow:

. In the *Explorer* view, open the XML file for your project, such as `my-project-name.xml`.
. Select *Build a Flow* from the start card to create an empty flow:
+
image:connectors::acb-build-flow.png["Canvas UI with starting card with the option to start from scratch, build a flow, or build a subflow"]
+
. Change the name of the flow: 
.. Click *Flow*. 
.. Click the edit icon. 
+
image:connectors::acb-change-flow-name.png["Arrow pointing to the flow name edit pencil icon"]
+
.. Enter the flow name, and click the checkmark. 
.. In the canvas UI, click the image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-plus.png["",15,15] (*Add component*) icon.
.. In the *Add Component* panel, search for and select your component from the results. The following example shows the *Listener* component from the *HTTP* search results:
+
image:anypoint-code-builder::main-tutorial-add-first-listener.png["Listener component highlighted in the Add Component section"]
+
The configuration XML file now includes the XML for the HTTP Listener into the `<flow/>` element, for example:
+
[source,XML]
----
<flow name="getFlights" >
  <http:listener path="" config-ref="" doc:name="Listener" doc:id="ojzfry" />
</flow>
----
// end::acb-add-components-to-project[]


[[add-global-config]]
== Add a Global Configuration
// tag::acb-add-global-config[]

Add another component, this time using the XML configuration menu. For example, add the `<http:listener-config/>` component from a snippet.

For more information about snippets, see xref:anypoint-code-builder::int-work-with-code-snippets.adoc[].

. In the configuration XML, place your cursor before the `<flow/>` element and type `http`.
+
Ensure that the cursor is not inside the `<flow/>` element.
. Type `http`, and select the `http:listener-config` snippet:
+
image:anypoint-code-builder::add-http-config-snippet.png["http:listener-config snippet highlighted in the configuration XML menu"]

The snippet adds the following code:

[source,xml]
----
<http:listener-config name="HTTP_Listener_config" >
  <http:listener-connection host="0.0.0.0" port="8081" />
</http:listener-config>
----
// end::acb-add-global-config[]

== Configure the Component Attributes
// tag::acb-configure-attributes[]

After you add components to your integration project, configure the attributes in the component UI, or configure the attributes directly in the XML code editor. 

Connector XML tags start with a namespace followed by an operation, following the syntax `namespace:operation`, such as `<db:select/>` for a *Select* operation in Anypoint Connector for Database (Database Connector).
// end::acb-configure-attributes[]


[[create-new-config]]
== Create a New Configuration XML File
// tag::acb-create-config-file-acb[]

Anypoint Code Builder creates the initial Mule configuration XML file in `src/main/mule`
within the Mule project.
This file contains global configurations and flow structures.

You can create additional configuration files, for example, to store global configurations.

To create a new XML configuration file:

. In the Explorer view, right-click the *mule* folder (`src/main/mule`) and select *New File*.
+
Alternatively, use the menu.
+
.Show me how
[%collapsible]
====
Select the `mule` folder, and then:

** In the desktop IDE, select *File* > *New Mule Configuration File*.
** In the cloud IDE, click the image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-menu.png["",18,18] (menu) icon, and select *File* > *New File*.
====
. Enter a name for the new file with the `.xml` extension.
. In the Editor view for the new file, press Ctrl+Space to display available options.
. Select *Empty mule configuration*:
+
image:anypoint-code-builder::int-new-mule-config.png[New Mule configuration option in auto-correct]
+
This command adds the following code to the file:
+
[source,xml]
--
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mule xmlns="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core" xmlns:doc="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/documentation"
    xmlns:ee="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ee/core"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core/current/mule.xsd
    http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ee/core http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ee/core/current/mule-ee.xsd">
    
</mule>
--

// end::acb-create-config-file-acb[]

[[check-connection]]
== Test an HTTP Listener Connection
// tag::acb-http-listener-test-connection[]

To test an HTTP Listener connection, click *Test Connection* in the configuration XML:

image:anypoint-code-builder::http-listener-test-connection.png["HTTP Listener Test Connection link in the configuration XML"]

The status bar shows the progress:

* *Verifying connection inbound-request* indicates that the test is in progress.
* *Connection is valid* indicates a successful connection. 
* *Invalid Connection Got status code: 500 when trying to resolve a Mule Runtime operation* indicates a connection error.
+
A common code `500` error is `port 8081: Address already in use`. For port conflicts, configure a different port, such as `8082`, and retest the connection. 

Before publishing, run your application in debug mode.

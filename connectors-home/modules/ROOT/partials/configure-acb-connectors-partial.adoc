[[import-connectors-from-exchange]]
== Import a Connector from Exchange

Anypoint Connectors provide operations for retrieving, modifying, and sending data to and from systems.
In addition to the xref:anypoint-code-builder::acb-components.adoc#builtin-connectors[built-in connectors] that Anypoint Code Builder provides,
you can download many other connectors from Anypoint Exchange.

To import a connector from Exchange and add it to your configuration:

. In the Explorer view, open the configuration XML file for your project, such as `my-project-name.xml`.
. Click the image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-tree-view.png["",15,15] (*Show Mule graphical mode*) icon in the activity bar to open the UI canvas if it doesn't open automatically.
. Add the connector the same way you added other components from the canvas:
.. In the canvas, click the image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-plus.png["",15,15] (*Add component*) icon.
.. In the *Add Component* panel, click *Connectors*.
.. Click the connector name and then click the operation to add, such as *Publish*:
+
image:anypoint-code-builder::int-add-connector-operation.png["Add Publish operation from the Anypoint MQ Connector"]
+
If the connector is not available locally, click the image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-search-exchange.png["",15,15] (*Search in Exchange*) toggle:
+
image:anypoint-code-builder::int-connector-search-exchange.png["Search in Exchange toggle"]
+
--
[calloutlist]
. Search locally
. Search in Exchange
--
.. Select the connector to add to your project.
.. Select the operation from the *Add Component* panel.


To import a connector from Exchange to use later in your project:

. In the Explorer view, open the configuration XML file for your project, such as `my-project-name.xml`.
. Click the image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-tree-view.png["",15,15] (*Show Mule graphical mode*) icon in the activity bar to open the canvas UI if it doesn't open automatically.
// Pointer to Command Palette
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-command-palette"]
. Select the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Import Asset from Exchange
----
. Select *Connector*.
. Search for the connector name to import, such as "MQ", for example:
+
image:anypoint-code-builder::int-import-connect-exchange.png["Import MQ Connector from Exchange]
. Select the connector.
. At the prompt, select the version of the connector to import, such as `v4.0.3`.
+
Anypoint Code Builder imports the connector and makes it available in the Components list.

For more information about the connectors available on Exchange, see 
xref:connectors::index.adoc[]. 
For more information about Exchange, see

[[configure-source]]
== Configure a Source

A source (trigger) starts the flow when specified conditions are met. You can configure one of these sources to use with {connector-name} Connector:

include::connectors::partial$t-studio-partial.adoc[tags=listener-scheduler-descriptions]

[[add-components]]
== Add Components to Your Project

The *Listener* is for triggering the flow, and *Set Payload* provides some test data for the integration.

. In the *Explorer* view, open the XML file for your project, such as `my-project-name.xml`:
+
image:anypoint-code-builder::int-empty-canvas.png["Canvas showing visual representation of Mule flow and the Mule configuration file"]
+
[calloutlist]
.. The canvas provides space for a visual representation of your Mule flows or subflows.
.. The configuration XML editor displays the configuration file for your Mule application.
. Select *Build a Flow* from the start card to create an empty flow.
+
image:anypoint-code-builder::build-flow.png["Canvas with starting card with the options to start from scratch, build a flow, or build a subflow"]
+
. Change the name of the flow: 
.. Click *Flow*. 
.. Click the edit icon to change the name. 
+
image:anypoint-code-builder::change-flow-name.png["Arrow pointing to the flow name edit pencil icon"]
+
.. Enter the name, and click the checkmark. 
.. In the canvas, click the image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-plus.png["",15,15] (*Add component*) icon.
.. In the *Add Component* panel, search for and select *Listener* from the *HTTP* results:
+
image:anypoint-code-builder::main-tutorial-add-first-listener.png["Listener component highlighted in the Add Component section"]
+
The configuration XML file now includes the XML for the HTTP Listener into the `<flow/>` element, for example:
+
[source,XML]
----
<flow name="getFlights" >
  <http:listener path="" config-ref="" doc:name="Listener" doc:id="ojzfry" />

</flow>
----
. Add another component, this time using the XML configuration menu.
For example, add the `<http:listener-config/>` component from a snippet.
+
For more information about snippets, see xref:anypoint-code-builder::int-work-with-code-snippets.adoc[].
+
.. In the configuration XML, place your cursor before the `<flow/>` element and type `http`.
+
Ensure that the cursor is not inside the `<flow/>` element.
+
.. Type `http`, and select the `http:listener-config` snippet:
+
image:anypoint-code-builder::add-http-config-snippet.png["http:listener-config snippet highlighted in the configuration XML menu"]
+
The snippet adds the following code:
+
[source,xml]
----
<http:listener-config name="HTTP_Listener_config" >
  <http:listener-connection host="0.0.0.0" port="8081" />
</http:listener-config>
----
. Add another component to your flow.
+
For example, add a *Set Payload* component to your HTTP *Listener* operation:
+
.. In the canvas, click the image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-plus.png["",15,15] (*Add component*) icon.
.. In the *Add Component* panel, search for and select *Set payload* from the *Transformer* results.


Your configuration XML file now looks similar to the following:

[source,xml]
--
  <http:listener-config name="HTTP_Listener_config" >
    <http:listener-connection host="0.0.0.0" port="8081" />
  </http:listener-config>

  <flow name="getFlights" >
    <http:listener path="" config-ref="" doc:name="Listener" doc:id="uvapcx" />
    <set-payload value="" doc:name="Set payload" doc:id="hnxirg" />
    
  </flow>
--

Notice that the *Listener* component in the canvas now shows an error:

image:anypoint-code-builder::int-canvas-error.png["Listener error in the canvas"]

To determine where the error is, select the processor in the canvas.
Anypoint Code Builder highlights its location within the configuration XML, for example:

image:anypoint-code-builder::int-error-highlight.png["HTTP Listener highlighted in the flow and in the XML code"]

To fix the error, configure the attributes.

For more information about debugging, see xref:anypoint-code-builder::debugging-mule-apps.adoc[].

[[configure-attributes]]
== Configure Attributes for a Component

After you add the components to the project, configure the attributes. 

For example, configure these attributes for the `<http:listener-config/>`,  `<http:listener/>`, and `<set-payload/>` elements:

[source,xml]
----
<http:listener-config name="inbound-request" doc:name="Listener Config" doc:id="b5c62f-a84a3a"> 
  <http:listener-connection host="0.0.0.0" port="8081"/> 
</http:listener-config>

<flow name="getFlights">
    <http:listener path="flights" config-ref="inbound-request" doc:name="HTTP /flights" doc:id="htprur" />
    <set-payload value="Flight info" doc:name="Set Response" doc:id="e43e98-1a9a01"/>
</flow>
----

[[check-connection]]
== Test an HTTP Listener Connection

To test an HTTP Listener connection, click *Test Connection* in the configuration XML:

image:anypoint-code-builder::http-listener-test-connection.png["HTTP Listener Test Connection link in the configuration XML"]

The status bar shows the progress:

* *Verifying connection inbound-request* indicates that the test is in progress.
* *Connection is valid* indicates a successful connection. 
* *Invalid Connection Got status code: 500 when trying to resolve a Mule Runtime operation* indicates a connection error.
+
A common code `500` error is `port 8081: Address already in use`. For port conflicts, configure a different port, such as `8082`, and retest the connection. 

Before publishing, run your application in debug mode.

// tag::acb-create-config-file-acb[]
[[create-new-config]]
== Create a New Configuration XML File

Anypoint Code Builder creates the initial Mule configuration XML file in `src/main/mule`
within the Mule project.
This file contains global configurations and flow structures.

You can create additional configuration files, for example to store global configurations.

To create a new XML configuration file:

. In the Explorer view, right-click the *mule* folder (`src/main/mule`) and select *New File*.
+
Alternatively, use the menu.
+
.Show me how
[%collapsible]

+
This command adds the following code to the file:
+
[source,xml]
--
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mule xmlns="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core" xmlns:doc="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/documentation"

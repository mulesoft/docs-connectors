// Partials for the Studio topic in the Connector Template

tag::topic-intro[]
Anypoint Studio (Studio) editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.

To add and configure a connector in Studio:

. <<create-mule-project,Create a Mule project>>.
. <<add-connector-to-project,Add the connector to your Mule project>>.
. <<configure-source,Configure a source for the connector's flow>>.
. <<add-connector-operation,Add a connector operation to the flow>>.
. <<configure-global-element,Configure a global element for the connector>>.
. <<configure-other-fields,Configure the other connector fields>>.

When you run the connector, you can view the app log to check for problems in real time, as described in <<view-app-log,View the App Log>>.

If you are new to configuring connectors in Studio, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-config-use-studio.adoc[Using Anypoint Studio to Configure a Connector]. If, after reading this topic, you need additional information about the connector fields, see the xref:{lc-connector-name}-connector-reference.adoc[{connector-name} Connector Reference].
end::topic-intro[]

tag::create-project-intro[]
In Studio, create a new Mule project in which to add and configure Anypoint Connector for {connector-name} ({connector-name} Connector):

. In Studio, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
. Enter a name for your Mule project and click *Finish*.
end::create-project-intro[]

tag::add-connector-to-project[]
Add {connector-name} Connector to your Mule project to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location and add the required dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file:

. In *Mule Palette*, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Dependencies to Project*, type `{exchange-search-name}` in the search field.
. Click *{studio-connector-name}* in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.
end::add-connector-to-project[]


tag::configure-source-intro[]
A source initiates a flow when a specified condition is met.
end::configure-source-intro[]

tag::listener-scheduler-descriptions[]
* *HTTP > Listener*
+
Initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port
+
* *Scheduler*
+
Initiates a flow when a time-based condition is met
end::listener-scheduler-descriptions[]

tag::listener-steps[]
For example, to configure an *HTTP > Listener* source, follow these steps:

. In *Mule Palette*, select *HTTP > Listener*.
. Drag *Listener* to the Studio canvas.
. On the *Listener* configuration screen, optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. Specify a value for the *Path* field.
. Click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of the *HTTP > Listener* source in the app.
. On the *General* tab, specify the connection information for the connector.
. On the *TLS* tab, optionally specify the TLS information for the connector.
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.
end::listener-steps[]

tag::add-connector-operation[]
When you add a connector operation to your flow, you are specifying an action for that connector to perform.

To add an operation for {connector-name} Connector, follow these steps:

. In *Mule Palette*, select *{connector-name}* and then select the desired operation.
. Drag the operation onto the Studio canvas, next to the source.
end::add-connector-operation[]


tag::global-element-intro[]
When you configure a connector, configure a global element that all instances of that connector in the app can use. Configuring a global element requires you to provide the authentication credentials that the connector requires to access the target {connector-name} system.
end::global-element-intro[]

tag::property-placeholders[]
You can reference a configuration file that contains ANT-style property placeholders (recommended), or you can enter your authorization credentials in the global configuration properties. For information about the benefits of using property placeholders and how to configure them, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-connector-configuration-overview.adoc[Anypoint Connector Configuration].
end::property-placeholders[]

tag::global-element-first-steps[]
To configure the global element for {connector-name} Connector, follow these steps:

. Select the operation in the Studio canvas.
. On the properties screen for the operation, click the Add (*+*) icon  to access the global element configuration fields.
end::global-element-first-steps[]

tag::global-element-tls-steps[]
[start=4]
. On the *TLS* tab, optionally specify the TLS information for the connector.
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.
end::global-element-tls-steps[]

tag::global-element-no-tls-steps[]
[start=4]
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.
end::global-element-no-tls-steps[]


tag::config-additional-fields[]
After you configure a global element for {connector-name} Connector, configure the other required fields for the connector. The required fields vary depending on which connector operation you use.
end::config-additional-fields[]

tag::view-app-log[]
To check for problems, you can view the app log as follows:

* If you’re running the app from Anypoint Platform, the app log output is visible on the Anypoint Studio console window.
* If you’re running the app using Mule from the command line, the app log output is visible in your operating system console.

Unless the log file path is customized in the app’s log file (`log4j2.xml`), you can also view the app log in the default location `MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`. You can configure the location of the log path in the app log file `log4j2.xml`.
end::view-app-log[]

tag::next-step-config-topics[]
After you configure a global element and connection information, configure the other fields for the connector. See xref:{lc-connector-name}-connector-config-topics.adoc[{connector-name} Additional Configuration Information] for use cases.
end::next-step-config-topics[]

tag::next-step-examples[]
After you configure a global element and connection information, configure the other fields for the connector. See xref:{lc-connector-name}-connector-examples.adoc[{connector-name} Connector Examples] for use cases.
end::next-step-examples[]

| Input Parameters | A map in which keys are the name of an input parameter to set on the JDBC prepared statement. Each parameter must be referenced in the SQL text using a colon prefix, for example, `where id = :myParamName`. The map's values contain the actual assignation for each parameter. | No

| Attribute | Description | Required
| Transactional action a| The type of joining action that operations can take for transactions:

** ALWAYS_JOIN
** JOIN_IF_POSSIBLE (Default)
** NOT_SUPPORTED | No
| Query timeout | Indicates the minimum amount of time before the JDBC driver attempts to cancel a running statement. By default, no timeout (`0`) is used. | No
| Query timeout unit | Select the unit of time to use. The default is SECONDS. | No
| Fetch size | Indicates how many rows to fetch from the database when rows are read from a `ResultSet`. This property is required when streaming is set to `true`, in which case a default value of `10` is used. | No
|Max rows | Sets the limit for the maximum number of rows that any `ResultSet` object generated by the message processor can contain for the given number. If the limit is exceeded, the excess rows are silently dropped. | No
|Parameter types | Array of xref:database-documentation.adoc#ParameterType[Parameter Type]. Use this parameter to optionally specify the type of (one or more) of the parameters in the query. If a value is provided, you're not required to reference all of the parameters. You can't reference a parameter that is not present in the input values. | No
| Target Variable | Name of the variable that stores the operation's output. |  No
| Target Value a| Expression that evaluates the operation's output. The expression outcome is stored in the target variable. | No
| Error Mappings | This attribute is not currently enabled. | No
|Reconnection Strategy |When an operation in a Mule application fails to connect to an external server, the default behavior is for the operation to fail immediately and return a connectivity error. You can modify the default behavior by configuring the reconnection strategy for the operation. This attribute is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See xref:database-documentation.adoc#reconnect[Reconnect] and xref:database-documentation.adoc#reconnect[Reconnect Forever], and <<configuring-reconnection-strategy>>.  | No

[NOTE]
SharePoint Connector sources (listeners) use Object Store to save watermarks. You might experience limitations that are specific to the Object Store implementation you are using (Object Store for CloudHub deployments or Object Store for on-premises deployments), so you must configure Object Store to suit your needs. +

`<sharepoint:file-move>`

Executes an HTTP POST against the Sharepoint API to move a file. The parameter fileServerRelativeUrl needs to point to an existing file in SharePoint. The parameter newFileServerRelativeUrl should be a path to where the file should be moved. If this is a directory, an error will be thrown since it should be a new file path. It can have the same name as the old file or it can have a new name. In order to use this operation as just a rename, specify the same path in both parameters and use a different file name in newFileServerRelativeUrl.

| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | The number of instances to initially keep in memory to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can fit into this buffer, then the buffer expands according to the bufferSizeIncrement attribute, with an upper limit of maxInMemorySize. |  100 |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This is by how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer should not expand, meaning that a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised when the buffer gets full. | 100 |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | The maximum amount of memory to use. If more memory is used, a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised. A value lower than or equal to zero means no limit. |  |

| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| In Memory Objects a| Number | The maximum amount of instances to keep in memory. If more than what is specified is required, content on the disk is buffered. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which maxInMemorySize is expressed |  |

= Use Anypoint Studio to Configure Zendesk Connector - Mule 4
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

Anypoint Studio (Studio) editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.

To add and configure a connector in Studio:

. <<create-mule-project,Create a Mule project>>.
. <<add-connector-to-project,Add the connector to your Mule project>>.
. <<configure-input-source,Configure an input source for the connector's flow>>.
. <<add-connector-operation,Add a connector operation to the flow>>.
. <<configure-global-element,Configure a global element for the connector>>.
. <<conigure-other-fields,Configure the other connector fields>>.

When you run the connector, you can view the app log to check for problems, as described in <<view-app-log,View the App Log>>.

If you are new to configuring connectors in Studio, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-config-use-studio.adoc[Use Studio to Configure a Connector]. If, after reading this topic, you need additional information about the connector fields, see the xref:zendesk-connector-reference.adoc[Zendesk Reference].

[[create-mule-project]]
== Create a Mule Project

In Studio, create a new Mule project in which to add and configure the connector:

. In Studio, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
. Enter a name for your Mule project and click *Finish*.

[[add-connector-to-project]]
== Add the Connector to Your Mule Project

Add Zendesk Connector to your Mule project to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location and add the required dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Modules to Project*, type `Zendesk` in the search field.
. Click Zendesk in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.

[[configure-input-source]]
== Configure a Source

A source initiates a flow when a specified condition is met.
You can configure one of these sources to use with Zendesk Connector:

////
If the connector has connector-specific input sources, list them first, using one bullet for each input source.
////

* <connector-specific input source>
* *HTTP > Listener* +
Initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port
* *Scheduler* +
Initiates a flow when a time-based condition is met

////
Use one input source as an example. If the connector has a connector-specific input source, use one of those input sources as an example. In the example, list the required and important fields.  If the connector does not have a connector-specific input source, use HTTP Listener, using the text shown below.
////

// Text for using HTTP Listener as an input source

For example, to configure an HTTP listener, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *HTTP > Listener*.
. Drag *Listener* to the Studio canvas.
. On the *Listener* configuration screen, optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. Specify a value for the *Path* field.
. Click the plus sign (+) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of HTTP *Listener* in the app.
. On the *General* tab, specify connection information for the connector.
. On the *TLS* tab, optionally specify the TLS information for the connector.
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

[[add-connector-operation]]
== Add a Connector Operation to the Flow

When you add a connector operation to your flow, you immediately define a specific operation for that connector to perform.

To add an operation for Zendesk Connector, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *Zendesk* and then select the desired operation.
. Drag the operation onto the Studio canvas to the right of the input source.

[[configure-global-element]]
== Configure a Global Element for the Connector

When you configure a connector, it's best to configure a global element that all instances of that connector in the app can use. Configuring a global element requires you to provide the authentication credentials that the connector requires to access the target Zendesk system. Zendesk Connector supports <mention the types of authorization the connector supports>.

To configure the global element for Zendesk Connector, follow these steps:

. Select the name of the connector in the Studio canvas.
. In the configuration screen for the operation, click the plus sign (+) next to the *Connector configuration* field to access the global element configuration fields.
. On the *General* tab, configure <authentication method 1, authentication method 2, etc.>, as described in the <<authentication method 1 and authentication 2>> > sections.
////
The wording of step 3 depends on how many authentication methods the connector uses. If the connector uses only one authentication method, mention it in step 3 and then explain how to configure it in this procedure. If the connector uses multiple authentication methods, mention them in step 3 and then refer to subsections that explain how to configure the authentication methods.
////
+
You can reference a configuration file that contains ANT-style property placeholders (recommended), or you can enter your authorization credentials in the global configuration properties. For information about the benefits of using property placeholders and how to configure them, see xref:introduction/intro-connector-configuration-overview.adoc[Anypoint Connector Configuration].
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

////
Example of wording for Basic authentication. This varies by connector.

[[basic_authentication]]
=== Basic Authentication

Enter the following information on the *General* tab of the *Global Element Properties* screen to configure Basic authentication:

[%header,cols=30s,70a]
|===
|Field |User Action
|Name |Enter the configuration name.
|Connection | Select *Basic*.
|Session Token | Optionally enter the session token provided by Amazon Security Token Service (STS).
|Access Key | Enter the access key provided by Amazon.
|Secret Key | Enter the secret key provided by Amazon.
|Try Default AWS Credentials Provider Chain | Set to `true` to obtain credentials from the AWS environment.
|Region Endpoint | Select the region endpoint for the service.
|===

The following image shows an example of configuring Basic authentication:

.Basic authentication fields
image::<image>.png[To configure authentication, select *Basic* in the *Connection* field and then complete the fields on the *General* tab.]

The first item shows where to specify that the connector will use Basic authentication. The second item shows the *General tab*, which contains fields related to Basic authentication.

Example of wording for Role authentication (this example is for Amazon connectors only)

[[role-authentication]]
=== Role Authentication

Enter the following information on the *General* tab of the global element configuration screen to configure Role authentication:

[%header,cols=30s,70a]
|===
|Field |User Action
|Name |Enter the configuration name.
|Connection | Select `Role`.
|Role ARN | Enter the role to assume to gain cross-account access.
|Access Key | Enter the access key provided by Zendesk.
|Secret Key | Enter the secret key provided by Zendesk.
|Try Default AWS Credentials Provider Chain | Set to `true` to obtain credentials from the AWS environment.
|Region Endpoint | Select the region endpoint for the service.
|===

The following image shows an example of configuring Role authentication:

.Role authentication fields
image::<image>.png[To configure Role authentication, select *Role* in the *Connection* field and then complete the fields on the *General* tab.]

The first item shows where to specify that the connector will use Role authentication. The second item shows the *General tab*, which contains fields related to Role authentication.
////

[[view-app-log]]

== View the App Log

To check for problems, you can view the app log as follows:

* If you're running the app from Anypoint Platform, the app log output is visible in the Anypoint Studio console window.
* If you're running the app using Mule from the command line, the app log output is visible in your OS console.

Unless the log file path is customized in the app's log file (`log4j2.xml`), you can also view the app log in the default location `MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`. You can configure the location of the log path in the app log file `log4j2.xml`.

== Next Step

After you configure a global element and connection information, configure the other fields for the connector. See xref:zendesk-connector-config-topics.adoc[Additional Configuration Information] for more configuration steps.

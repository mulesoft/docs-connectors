= Use Anypoint Studio to Configure EDIFACT EDI Connector 2.1 - Mule 4

Anypoint Studio (Studio) editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.

To add and configure a connector in Studio:

. <<create-mule-project,Create a Mule project>>.
. <<add-connector-to-project,Add the connector to your Mule project>>.
. <<configure-source,Configure a source for the connector's flow>>.
. <<add-connector-operation,Add a connector operation to the flow>>.
. <<configure-global-element,Configure a global element for the connector>>.
. <<configure-other-fields,Configure the other connector fields>>.
////
When you run the connector, you can view the app log to check for problems in real time, as described in <<view-app-log,View the App Log>>.

If you are new to configuring connectors in Studio, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-config-use-studio.adoc[Use Studio to Configure a Connector].
////
If, after reading this topic, you need additional information about the connector fields, see the xref:edifact-edi-connector-reference.adoc[EDIFACT EDI Reference].

[[create-mule-project]]
== Create a Mule Project

In Studio, create a new Mule project in which to add and configure the connector:

. In Studio, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
. Enter a name for your Mule project and click *Finish*.

[[add-connector-to-project]]
== Add the Connector to Your Mule Project

Add EDIFACT EDI Connector to your Mule project to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location and add the required dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In the *Add Dependencies to Project* window, type `EDIFACT EDI` in the search field.
. Click EDIFACT EDI in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.

[[configure-source]]
== Configure a Source

A source initiates a flow when a specified condition is met.
You can configure this source to use with EDIFACT EDI Connector:

* HTTP Listener +
Initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port.

For example, to configure an HTTP Listener source, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *HTTP > Listener*.
. Drag *Listener* to the Studio canvas.
. On the *Listener* configuration screen, optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. Specify a value for the *Path* field.
. Click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of the HTTP Listener source in the app.
. On the *General* tab, specify connection information for the connector.
. On the *TLS* tab, optionally specify the TLS information for the connector.
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

[[add-connector-operation]]
== Add a Connector Operation to the Flow

When you add a connector operation to your flow, you are specifying an action for that connector to perform.
To add an operation for EDIFACT EDI Connector, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *EDIFACT EDI* and then select the desired operation.
. Drag the operation onto the Studio canvas to the right of the input source.

[[configure-global-element]]
== Configure a Global Element for the Connector

When you configure a connector, configure a global element that all instances of that connector in the app can use. Configuring a global element requires you to provide the authentication credentials that the connector requires to access the target EDIFACT EDI system.

To configure the global element for EDIFACT EDI Connector, follow these steps:

. Select the operation in the Studio canvas.
. In the configuration screen for the operation, click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to access the global element configuration fields.
. On the *General* tab, in *Connection*, select the authentication method to configure.
+
You can reference a configuration file that contains ANT-style property placeholders (recommended), or you can enter your authorization credentials in the global configuration properties.
+
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

[[configure-other-fields]]
== Configure Additional Connector Fields

After you configure a global element for EDIFACT EDI, configure other optional or required fields for the connector. The required fields vary depending on which connector operation you use.

=== General Tab
////
image::edifact-edi-general.jpg[General tab properties]
////
Use the *General* tab to configure settings for reading and writing EDIFACT messages.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|Schema definitions |Manually create or edit the list of schema definitions used for the message structures
|Substitution character |Use to replace invalid characters in string data
|Separators usage |Whether to use specified values as defaults for writes or reads
|Data element separator |The default data element separator character
|Component element separator |The default component element separator character
|Repetition separator |The default repetition separator character
|Segment terminator |The default segment terminator character
|Release character |The default release character
|===

=== Identity Tab
////
image::edifact-edi-identity.jpg[Identity tab properties]
////
Use the *Identity* tab to configure the Interchange Header (UNB) identifier values for you and your trading partner in the EDIFACT EDI connector configuration. If configured, then the values are verified when reading an input message and used as the defaults when writing an output message. This is only if no value output data is specified.

You can set these values for your Mule application and partner:

* Interchange ID qualifier
* Interchange ID

The Mule values specify the Receiver fields (UNB3.1/UNB3.2) in a Receive message, and populate the Sender fields (UNB2.1/UNB2.2) in a Send message.

=== Parser Tab
////
image::edifact-edi-parser.jpg[Parser tab properties]
////
If needed, set these to control parser validation of Receive messages.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|Enforce length limits |Enforce minimum and maximum receive value lengths
|Enforce value repeats |Enforce repetition count limits for receive values
|Enforce valid characters |Enforce valid characters for UNOA/UNOB syntax levels
|Allow unknown segments |Allow unknown segments in a message
|Enforce segment order |Enforce segment order in a message
|Allow unused segments |Allow segments marked as `Unused` in a message
|Enforce segment repeats |Enforce segment repetition count limits in a message
|Character encoding override |Override character encoding for Receive messages
|Require unique interchanges |Require unique Interchange Control References (UNB.5)
|Require unique messages |Require globally unique Message Reference Numbers (UNH.1)
|Store time-to-live |Set the minimum number of days to store interchange and message numbers for uniqueness checking.
|===


=== Writer Tab

Use the *Writer* tab to specify message writing settings.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|Write character encoding |Set character encoding used for writing messages. The encoding must be defined in EDIFACT syntax versions.
|Syntax version |Set syntax version (UNB1.2)
|Segment line ending |Enable a line ending that's written between segments to make output more readable
|Always send UNA |Always send UNA service segment. This is only sent when using non-standard separator characters.
|Enforce valid characters |Enforce valid characters for UNOA and UNOB syntax levels
|Request acknowledgments |Request acknowledgments for Send interchanges using the Acknowledgment Request field (UNB.9)
|Test indicator |Set a test indicator digit for use on Send interchanges (UNB.11)
|Unique message numbers |Whether to use supplied values for control-segment information such as control numbers
|Initial message reference |Whether to use the default output MIME type `application/plain` or the Edifact-specific alternative `application/edifact`

*Release Notes:* xref:release-notes::connector/peoplesoft-connector-release-notes.adoc[PeopleSoft Connector Release Notes]

The PeopleSoft Connector is a closed source connector that uses the Component Interface (CI) to communicate in real-time with the service. This is a component provided by Oracle’s People Tools.

Read more about Oracle's http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E41633_01/pt853pbh1/eng/pt/index.html?content=i_product[PeopleTools].

[[prerequisites]]
== Before You Begin

Because of how closely the connector is coupled with PeopleSoft, this document assumes you have:

* A working knowledge of PeopleSoft.
* Read the relevant documentation on <<Component Interfaces (CI), Component Interfaces>> and Integration Scenarios for your PeopleTools version.

[NOTE]
The definition and detailed explanation of the PeopleSoft terms and concepts used here are freely available in the PeopleBooks documentation set of your PeopleSoft installation.

This document assumes you are familiar with Mule, xref:3.7@mule-runtime::amqp-connector.adoc[Anypoint Connectors], and xref:studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio].

To use the PeopleSoft connector, you must have the following:

* **Anypoint Studio:** if you don't use Anypoint Studio for development, follow the instructions to install the PeopleSoft Maven dependencies into your pom.xml file .
* **Java 7:** PeopleSoft connector does not work unless you are using JRE 1.7. http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase7-521261.html[Download JRE 1.7].
* **Component Interface:** at least one Component Interface must be created and exposed within the PeopleSoft instance using the Application Designer.
* **PeopleSoft Java Object Adapter JAR File:** the `psjoa.jar` library is compiled and provided by a PeopleSoft administrator, and is unique to each installation of PeopleSoft.

=== Component Interfaces (CI)

PeopleSoft's Component Interfaces are a “one-way”, real-time interface to your PeopleSoft database instance. A component in PeopleSoft is a logical grouping of PeopleSoft pages representing a complete business transaction, such as Employee Onboarding. Component Interfaces expose the underlying APIs used by PeopleSoft Components and, therefore, ensure that validations, defaults, and business logic are preserved from the original definition of those components.

The Component Interfaces allow you to query PeopleSoft for specific records, update data, and create new instances of the records.

=== Attributes and Architecture

A component interface has the following four main attributes:

[.center.text-center]
image::ps-ci-architecture.jpg[CI+archtecture]

*  *Component Interface Name*: each component interface requires a unique name. The programs calling a component use the name of the component interface to access properties and methods.
*  *Keys (Get keys, Create keys, and Find keys)*: keys are special properties containing values that retrieve an instance (get keys) or a list of instances (find keys) of the component interface. You can add, remove, or change keys in PeopleSoft Application Designer. Keys are created automatically when you create a component interface. +
** *Get keys:* map to fields marked as search keys in the Components Search record.
** *Create keys:* generated in CI when the Use tab on the Component Properties dialog allows the Add action.
** *Find keys:* map to fields marked as both Alternate Search keys and Search Key in the Component Search Record.
*  *Properties and Collections (Fields and Records):* properties provide access to both component data and component interface settings. A property can correspond to a field or a scroll (collection). A component interface collection is a special type of property that corresponds to a scroll and contains fields and subordinate scrolls as defined in its underlying component. There are two types of properties:   +
** *Standard properties* are assigned automatically when a component interface is created.
** *User-defined properties* map to record fields on the PeopleSoft component and are displayed in the PeopleSoft Application Designer.
*  *Methods:* a method is a function that performs a specific task on a component interface at run time. There are two main types of methods: standard and user-defined.
**  *Standard methods* are those that are available for all component interfaces. The following are the standard methods that the connector supports:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Method |Description
|*Create* |Add a new instance of the Component Interface to the PeopleSoft database. This is similar to clicking Add and entering the relevant keys through the PeopleSoft Web UI.
|*Cancel* |Cancel an instance of the Component Interface. This is equivalent of the Cancel operation in the Web UI when working on a particular component.
|*Find* |Search for any instances of the component that match the provided Search Keys. This returns a list of possible matches.
|*Get* |Retrieve instances that match the specific keys you provide. This returns a single record or none at all.
|*Save* a|
Save changes made to the component, new, or existing.

[WARNING]
The Save operation tries to update an existing record before creating a new one. For new records, the connector automatically populates the keys with default values provided by the PeopleSoft instance, thereby reducing the need for the user to provide the default key/values pairs.

|===
+
** *User-defined methods* are created in PeopleSoft Application Designer to provide added functionality to the component interface.

[[upgrading]]
=== Upgrading From an Older Version

==== From 1.x.x to 2.0.0

Inside your flow, identify the `peoplesoft:invoke-operation` tag. It should look similar to the following snippet:

[source,xml]
----
<peoplesoft:invoke-operation config-ref="PeopleSoft" doc:name="Find" type="CI_PERSONAL_DATA##Find"/>
----

* Replace the parameter *type* with *key*.
* Replace the operation symbol `##` (double hash) with `||` (double pipe).

The final result should look like the following snippet:

[source,xml]
----
<peoplesoft:invoke-operation config-ref="PeopleSoft" doc:name="Find" key="CI_PERSONAL_DATA||Find"/>
----



[[using-the-connector]]
== Using The Connector

PeopleSoft connector is an operation-based connector, which means that when you add the connector to your flow, you need to configure a specific operation, *Invoke Component Interface*, for the connector to perform. After you call the Invoke Component Interface, you can use the Component Name field to select a particular Component Interface and the Operation field to specify the method that you want it to execute. PeopleSoft connector allows you to perform five standard operations (Create, Find, Get, Save, Cancel) on each Component Interface (if available in your PeopleSoft instance), along with any CI-specific custom operations.

[[use-cases-and-demos]]
=== Use Cases and Demos

Listed below are the most common use cases for the PeopleSoft connector:

[%autowidth.spread]
|===
|*Find Employees*|Retrieves one or more Employee records by invoking the Find operation of CI_PERSONAL_DATA
|*Get Employee*|Retrieves the complete information of a single Employee Personal Data record by invoking the Get operation of CI_PERSONAL_DATA.
|*Save Employee*|Updates the fields of a single Employee Personal Data record by invoking the Save operation of CI_PERSONAL_DATA Component Interface.
|*Save Employee From CSV File*|Updates a single Employee Personal Data record by invoking the Save operation of CI_PERSONAL_DATA Component Interface.
|*Save Position From CSV File*|Updates a single Position Data record by invoking the Save operation of CI_POSITION_DATA Component Interface.
|===

[[tips]]
=== Tips

==== Test the Connection

Use the *Test Connection* feature to validate not only the connection to the PeopleSoft instance, but also the Component Interfaces defined in the allowlist.

. Open the *PeopleSoft Global Element Configuration*.
. Click the *Test Connection* button. If one ore more Component Interfaces names are invalid, you will get an error message.
. To solve this issue, just click the [...] button next to the *Create Object manually* option and provide the correct name for the Component.

[.center.text-center]
image::ps-tips-testconnection.png[DataSense Timeout]

==== Avoid DataSense Timeout

The metadata retrieval for the *Save* operation takes longer than the rest of the operations. Therefore, Studio might throw a timeout exception with the message: "Problem while fetching metadata. The operation timed out and was not successful. You can configure this timeout in the Studio Preferences dialog."

[.center.text-center]
image::ps-tips-timeout.png[DataSense Timeout]

. Go to *Windows > Preferences*.
. Expand the *Anypoint Studio* menu and select *DataSense*.
. Set the option *DataSense Connection Timeout (in seconds)* to 120.
. Click *Apply*.
. Click *OK*.

[.center.text-center]
image::ps-tips-timeout-config.png[DataSense Timeout Config]

[NOTE]
If you click the *Refresh metadata* link in your flow settings and wait a few moments, the metadata for the Save operation should now be correctly populated.

=== Run Time

. Save and **run** the project as a Mule Application.
. Open a web browser and check the response after entering the URL `**http://localhost:8081/find?id=MULE&name=&last_name=&name_ac=**`. If in your PeopleSoft database there are records whose KEYPROP_EMPLID contains the value "MULE", you should get a JSON collection with those records. Otherwise, you receive an empty collection.

[source,json,linenums]

[
    {
    "KEYPROP_EMPLID": "MULE0001",
    "PROP_NAME": "Muley",
    "PROP_LAST_NAME_SRCH": "The Mule",
    "PROP_NAME_AC": ""
    },
    {
    "KEYPROP_EMPLID": "MULE0002",
    "PROP_NAME": "Second Muley",
    "PROP_LAST_NAME_SRCH": "The Backup Mule",
    "PROP_NAME_AC": ""
    },
    ...
]
----
NOTE: In this example, all input parameters for the FIND operation are optional. If none of them defined (`http://localhost:8081/find?id=&name=&last_name=&name_ac=`), then PeopleSoft will retrieve the first 300 records available (the maximum limited by the server).

Anypoint Connector for Microsoft .NET (Microsoft .NET Connector) enables you to execute native .NET code in a Mule application.

This connector executes .NET code using Java Native Interface (JNI), which provides fast interprocess communication between Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and a native application that runs in a host operating system.

The connector supports one operation, *Execute*, which enables users to select a class and method to execute, and to pass the corresponding arguments for that method.

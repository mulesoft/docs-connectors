= Using Anypoint Studio to Configure Microsoft .NET Connector 3.1 - Mule 4

Anypoint Studio (Studio) editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.

To add and configure a connector in Studio:

. <<create-mule-project,Create a Mule project>>.
. <<add-connector-to-project,Add the connector to your Mule project>>.
. <<configure-input-source,Configure a source for the connector's flow>>.
. <<add-connector-operation,Add a connector operation to the flow>>.
. <<configure-global-element,Configure a global element for the connector>>.
. <<configure-other-fields,Configure the other connector fields>>.

When you run the connector, you can view the app log to check for problems, as described in <<view-app-log,View the App Log>>.

If you are new to configuring connectors in Studio, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-config-use-studio.adoc[Using Anypoint Studio to Configure a Connector]. If, after reading this topic, you need additional information about the connector fields, see the xref:microsoft-dotnet-connector-reference.adoc[Reference].

[[create-mule-project]]
== Create a Mule Project

In Studio, create a new Mule project in which to add and configure the connector:

. In Studio, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
. Enter a name for your Mule project and click *Finish*.

[[add-connector-to-project]]
== Add the Connector to Your Mule Project

Add Anypoint Connector for Microsoft .NET (Microsoft .NET Connector) to your Mule project to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location and to add the required dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In the *Add Dependencies to Project* window, type `microsoft.net` in the search field.
. Click *Microsoft .NET Connector* in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.

[[configure-input-source]]
== Configure a Source

A source initiates a flow when a specified condition is met.
You can configure one of these sources to use with Microsoft .NET Connector:

* *HTTP Listener*
+
Initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port.
* *Scheduler*
+
Initiates a flow when a time-based condition is met.

For example, to configure *HTTP Listener*, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *HTTP* > *Listener*.
. Drag *Listener* to the Studio canvas.
. On the *Listener* configuration screen, optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. Specify a value for the *Path* field.
. Click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of `HTTP Listener` in the app.
. On the *General* tab, specify connection information.
. On the *TLS* tab, optionally specify TLS information.
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specific server.
. Click *OK*.

[[add-connector-operation]]
== Add a Connector Operation to the Flow

When you add a connector operation to your flow, you immediately define a specific operation for that connector to perform.

To add an operation for Microsoft .NET, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *Microsoft DotNet* and then select the desired operation.
. Drag the operation onto the Studio canvas to the right of the source.

[[configure-global-element]]
== Configure a Global Element for the Connector

When you configure a connector, it’s best to configure a global element that all instances of that connector in the app can use. Configuring a global element requires you to provide the authentication credentials the connector uses to access the target Microsoft .NET system.

To configure the global element for Microsoft .NET Connector, follow these steps:

. Select the name of the connector in the Studio canvas.
. In the configuration screen for the operation, click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to access the global element configuration fields.
. On the *General* tab, complete these fields:
+
image::microsoft-dotnet-connection.png[Studio General tab]
+
* *Connection*
+
Select a connection type.
+
* *Scope*
+
Select the connection scope:
+
** *Singleton*
+
Shares the same instance of the Microsoft .NET component across multiple calls. Use this option to store a shared state in class instance members across different calls.
** *Transient*
+
Creates a new instance of the Microsoft .NET component per request.
* *Grant Full Trust to the .NET assembly*
+
Microsoft .NET code can be executed in an application domain with restricted privileges to avoid the execution of malware code that can affect the stability of the Mule runtime engine. These restrictions include limited access to the file system, native code execution, network calls, registry access, and more. By default the Microsoft .NET connector is set to use full trust.
+
* *Declared methods only*
+
If the *Declared methods only* field is set to `true`, the metadata fetches only the declared methods from the .NET assembly and populates the *Method* field in the *Method Info* section with these methods. The default is `false`.
* *Include auto generated code*
+
If the *Include auto generated code* field is set to `false` (the default value), the metadata does not fetch the compiler-generated methods, so these methods won't appear in the *Method* field.
+
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

=== Configure the External Connection Type

Use the *External* connection type to connect with an assembly external to the application.

In the *Connection* field, select *External*:

=== Configure the Gac Connection Type

Use the *Gac* connection type to connect with an assembly installed in the GAC (Global Assembly Cache):

. In the *Connection* field, select *Gac*.
. In the *Assembly Type* field, enter the fully qualified type name for the Gac connection type, for example, `Namespace.ClassName`.
+

== Configure the Legacy Connection Type

Use the *Legacy* connection type for backward compatibility:

. In the *Connection* field, select *Legacy*.
. In the *Assembly Type* field, enter the fully qualified type name for the *Legacy* connection type, for example, `Namespace.ClassName`.
. In the *Assembly Path* field, enter the path of the Microsoft .NET assembly, for example, `C:\Projects\..dll`.
+

=== Configure the Resource Connection Type

Use the *Resource* connection type to connect with an assembly embedded as a resource:

. In the *Connection* field, select *Resource*.
. In the *Path* field, specify the relative path to an executable .NET library in the resource folder.
+
The default resources folder is `src/main/resources`.
+

[[configure-other-fields]]
== Configure the Other Connector Fields

After you configure a global element for Microsoft .NET Connector, configure the other required fields for the connector:

[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|Table name | Name of the table to create
|Attribute definitions | Attributes that describe the key schema for the table and its indexes
|Key schemas | Attributes that compose the primary key for a table or index
|===

== View the App Log

To check for problems, you can view the app log as follows:

* If you’re running the app from Anypoint Platform, the output is visible in the Anypoint Studio console window.
* If you’re running the app using Mule from the command line, the app log is visible in your OS console.

Unless the log file path is customized in the app’s log file (`log4j2.xml`), you can also view the app log in the default location `MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`.

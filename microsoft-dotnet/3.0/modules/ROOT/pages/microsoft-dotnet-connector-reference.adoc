NOTE: This connector is compatible only with Java 8.

[[dot-net-config]]
== Default Configuration

=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | |x
| Connection a| * <<dot-net-config_external, External>>
* <<dot-net-config_gac, GAC>>
* <<dot-net-config_legacy, Legacy>>
* <<dot-net-config_resource, Resource>>
 | The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | |x
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform expires the instance at the exact moment it becomes eligible. The runtime only purges instances as needed. |  |
|===

[[dot-net-config_external]]
== External Connection Type

=== Parameters

| Include auto generated code a| Boolean |  Set Include Auto Generated Code |  false |
| Path a| String |  Provide the name of the .NET assembly for example, `<Company>.<Component>.dll` |  |x
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to true, deployment fails if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy |  |
|===

:page-aliases: connectors::veevavault/veevavault-connector-design-center.adoc

Anypoint Design Center's Flow Designer enables you to create apps visually. For more information, see the xref:design-center::fd-tour.adoc[Flow Designer Tour].

To create an app in Flow Designer:

* Configure the input source (trigger) for your app.
* Add the connector as a component to process the input for the app.

For information about Flow Designer field values, see the xref:veevavault-connector-reference.adoc[Veeva Vault Connector Reference].


== Configure the Input Source Trigger

. In Design Center, click *Create*.
. Click *Create new application* to open Flow Designer.
. Specify a value for *Project name* and click *Create*.
. Click *Go straight to canvas* to exit from *Let's get started*.
. Click the trigger card.
. If you are using the HTTP Listener operation as a trigger, search for and select *HTTP Listener*.
. In the HTTP Listenerâ€™s *General* tab, enter the *Path* that defines the resource location. +
The path is the relative path from the path set in the HTTP Listener configuration.
. Click the *X* in the upper-right corner of the card to close the trigger card.

Flow Designer automatically saves all changes.

== Configure the Target Component

The target component enables your app to process data received from the trigger. Veeva Vault Connector provides operations that help you integrate Veeva Vault with third-party applications and services. For example, this integration enables you to create Vault connectivity and retrieve picklists data from the Vault, which can then be further integrated or processed.

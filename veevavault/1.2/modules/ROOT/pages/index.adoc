= Veeva Vault Connector 1.2 - Mule 4


Support Category: https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#anypoint-connectors[Select]


Anypoint Connector for Veeva Vault (Veeva Vault Connector) enables you to connect Mule flows to the Veeva Vault platform using the Veeva Vault REST API.

For information about compatibility and fixed issues, see xref:release-notes::connector/veeva-vault-release-notes-mule-4.adoc[Veeva Vault Connector Release Notes].

This connector works with the https://developer.veevavault.com/api/19.1/#authentication[Veeva Vault REST, Bulk, and Streaming API], depending on the operations you configure. Each API call uses a JSON or CSV request and returns JSON input stream responses over an HTTPS connection. All required request headers, error handling, and HTTPS connection configurations are built into the connector.

You can use Veeva Vault Connector in Mule applications as an outbound connector with CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete), query, export, and Spark validator operations on the following Veeva Vault objects:

* Documents +
Create, retrieve, update, delete, export
* Document Renditions +
Create, retrieve, delete
* Vault Object +
Create, retrieve, update, delete
* Picklists: Retrieve
* Audit Trail: Retrieve
* Query +
VQL query to query on documents, Vault objects, workflows
* Spark validator +
Validates and verifies the Spark message with signature that is triggered from Veeva Vault
* Invoke Rest API +
Operation to invoke https://developer.veevavault.com/api/20.1/#documents[Veeva Vault Rest APIs], where a specific connector operation doesn't already exist. To maintain https://developer.veevavault.com/docs/#api-rate-limits[API rate limits] use bulk Rest APIs rather than single APIs whenever possible.

You can configure Veeva Vault Connector using basic authentication with credentials to connect to a Veeva Vault instance and perform operations.

= Using Anypoint Studio to Configure Veeva Vault Connector 1.5 - Mule 4
:page-aliases: connectors::veevavault/veevavault-connector-studio.adoc, connectors::veevavault/veevavault-design-center.adoc

Anypoint Studio (Studio) editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.

To add and configure a connector in Studio:

. <<create-mule-project,Create a Mule project>>.
. <<add-connector-to-project,Add the connector to your Mule project>>.
. <<configure-source,Configure a source for the connector's flow>>.
. <<add-connector-operation,Add a connector operation to the flow>>.
. <<configure-global-element,Configure a global element for the connector>>.

When you run the connector, you can view the app log to check for problems in real time, as described in <<view-app-log,View the App Log>>.

If you are new to configuring connectors in Studio, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-config-use-studio.adoc[Using Anypoint Studio to Configure a Connector]. If, after reading this topic, you need additional information about the connector fields, see the xref:veevavault-connector-reference.adoc[Veeva Vault Reference].

[[create-mule-project]]
== Create a Mule Project

In Studio, create a new Mule project in which to add and configure the connector:

. In Studio, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
. Enter a name for your Mule project and click *Finish*.

[[add-connector-to-project]]
== Add the Connector to Your Mule Project

Add Veeva Vault Connector to your Mule project to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location and add the required dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file:

. In *Mule Palette*, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Dependencies to Project*, type `veeva vault` in the search field.
. Click Veeva Vault in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.

[[configure-source]]
== Configure a Source

A source initiates a flow when a specified condition is met.
You can configure one of these sources to use with Veeva Vault Connector:

* HTTP Listener +
Initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port
* Scheduler +
Initiates a flow when a time-based condition is met

For example, to configure an HTTP Listener source, follow these steps:

. In *Mule Palette*, select *HTTP > Listener*.
. Drag *Listener* to the Studio canvas.
. On the *Listener* configuration screen, optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. Specify a value for the *Path* field.
. Click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of the HTTP Listener source in the app.
. On the *General* tab, specify connection information for the connector.
. On the *TLS* tab, optionally specify the TLS information for the connector.
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

[[add-connector-operation]]
== Add a Connector Operation to the Flow

When you add a connector operation to your flow, you are specifying an action for that connector to perform.

To add an operation for Veeva Vault Connector, follow these steps:

. In *Mule Palette*, select *Veeva Vault* and then select the desired operation.
. Drag the operation onto the Studio canvas, next to the input source.

[[configure-global-element]]
== Configure a Global Element for the Connector

When you configure a connector, configure a global element that all instances of that connector in the app can use. Configuring a global element requires you to provide the authentication credentials that the connector requires to access the target Veeva Vault system. Veeva Vault Connector supports Basic authentication.

To configure the global element for Veeva Vault Connector, follow these steps:

. Select the operation in the Studio canvas.
. In the *General* configuration screen for the operation, click the *Add* icon to access the global element configuration fields.
. In the *General* tab, in *Connection*, select the authentication method to configure:
* <<basic_auth>>
* <<oauth2-oidc-connection>>
+
You can reference a configuration file that contains ANT-style property placeholders (recommended), or you can enter your authorization credentials in the global configuration properties. For information about the benefits of using property placeholders and how to configure them, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-connector-configuration-overview.adoc[Anypoint Connector Configuration].
. In the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

[[basic_auth]]
=== Basic Connection

Enter the following information in the *General* tab of the *Global Element Properties* screen to configure Basic authentication:

[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|Name | Configuration name
|Vault URL | URL of the Veeva Vault instance required for the connection
|Username | Username used to initialize the session
|Password | Password used to authenticate the user
|Client Id | Client ID to send with each request header to the Veeva Vault instance for tracking purposes, in the format `\{organization}-{company/team}`. +

The client ID has the prefix `mulesoft` and the suffix `client-vaultconnector`, for example, `mulesoft-abcpharma-clinicalprod-client-vaultconnector`.
|===

The following image shows an example of configuring the *General* tab for Basic authentication:

image::basic-auth.png["Authentication fields completed in the General tab for Basic authentication"]

Enter the following information in the *Advanced* tab of the *Global Element Properties* screen to configure the burst API limit for Basic authentication:

[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|Response Timeout | Maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, that the connector waits for the Veeva Vault response. If the maximum amount of time is exceeded, a timeout exception is thrown. The default is 30,000 milliseconds (30 seconds).
|Burst API Limit Profile | Burst API limit profile configuration to act upon if the specified burst API limit of the Veeva Vault API reaches or exceeds the configured threshold. +

If *Burst API limit config* is enabled (default), then the connector evaluates the Veeva Vault API's response header (`X-VaultAPI-BurstLimitRemaining`) value against the specified *API Limit Threshold* value. If the remaining burst API limit reaches or exceeds the specified *API Limit Threshold* value, the connector waits for the specified amount of time to restart the count of *Burst Limit Remaining*. +

The following example shows an application log with a warning message at `2019-06-06 10:34:45,096`, halting the process for five minutes, as shown in the next message at `2019-06-06 10:39:45,098`:

[[oauth2-oidc-connection]]
=== OAuth 2.0 / Open ID Connection Provider


include::connectors::partial$oauth2-description.adoc[]

Veeva Vault supports several OAuth providers, such as Azure AD, Ping Federate, and any other provider that supports OIDC (OpenID Connect).

NOTE: Currently, Okta and any other providers that require PKCE are not supported.

Configure the OAuth provider for Veeva Vault Connector. The following steps show how to configure the Veeva service to communicate with the OAuth provider:

. In the Veeva Vault Admin panel, navigate to the *Settings* tab.
. In *Domain Settings*, select *OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect Profiles*.
. Click *Create*.
. Configure your profile. Enter values for *Label* and *Name*, set *Status* to `Active`, and set *Authorization Server Provider* to the provider you are using, or select `Other` if your provider is not in the list. You can also uncheck the *Perform strict Audience Restriction validation* checkbox.
. Enter information for *AS Metadata*. All OpenID Connect providers have a URL ending with `/.well-known/openid-configuration`, which contains this metadata. For example:

* Okta: `\https://{OKTA_INSTANCE}.okta.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`
* Azure: `\https://login.microsoftonline.com/{TENANT}/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration`
* PingFederate: `\https://{YOUR_INSTANCE}/.well-known/openid-configuration`
+
Use this metadata to configure *AS Metadata* by clicking the *Upload AS Metadata* button and selecting the *Provide Authorization Server Metadata URL* option. This enables you to paste the above URL into *AS Metadata*.
+
image::oauth-veeva-config-profile.png["OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect Profile configuration window with completed fields from the steps above"]
+
. Click *Save*. Now, you can see the created profile.
+
image::oauth-veeva-config-session-id.png[Vault Session ID URL and AS Metadata URL fields in a new window after creating the profile]
+
Note down the *Vault Session ID URL* for further use when you configure the connector. To fully configure Veeva with OpenID, you must provision users to use this new profile. Refer to the https://platform.veevavault.help/en/gr/13977/[Provision Users to Use SSO] for more information.

Now, you can configure Veeva Vault Connector with OAuth 2.0.

Enter the following information in the *General* tab of the *Global Element Properties* screen to configure OAuth 2.0 / Open ID connection:

[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|Name | Configuration name
|Vault URL | Veeva Vault instance URL required for connection.
|Version | Version for the Veeva Vault instance required.
|Client Id | Client ID required to send with each request header to the Vault instance.
|OIDC Profile ID | OIDC profile ID generated by Veeva when creating a new OIDC profile. To configure the OIDC profile ID, use the ID in your OIDC profile in Veeva. Your OIDC profile contains a *Vault Session ID URL*, for example, `\https://login.veevavault.com/auth/oauth/session/_00000000-aaaa-bbbb-cccc-111111111111`, in which `_00000000-aaaa-bbbb-cccc-111111111111` is the OIDC profile ID. Use this value for the *OIDC Profile ID* field.
|Consumer Key | OAuth consumer key, as registered with the service provider. This is your IdP client ID, assuming you already have a client application registration created at the ID provider of your choice, for example, PoneOne or PingFederate.
|Consumer Secret | OAuth consumer secret, as registered with the service provider. This is your IdP client secret, assuming you already have a client application registration created at the ID provider of your choice, for example, PoneOne or PingFederate.
|Authorization Url | OAuth 2.0 authorization URL, such as `\https://{your-instance}/as/authorization.oauth2` for PingFederate.
|Access Token Url | OAuth 2.0 token URL, such as `\https://{your-instance}/as/token.oauth2`.
|Scopes | You can set up your OAuth 2.0 scopes as necessary, but the important ones `openid` and `offline_access` are already pre-filled.
|Resource Owner Id | Depending on your IdP configuration, you can leave it blank.
|Listener Config | Create a new HTTP Listener or use an existing one if you have one, for example, `\http://localhost:8081/`.
|Callback Path | Callback path of your application. If you set it to `callback`, your full callback path is `\http://localhost:8081/callback`. Do not forget to add your callback path to the IdP's redirect URLs.
|Authorize Path | Authorize path. You will navigate to this path when starting the OAuth 2.0 dance, for example, `authorize` means the full path is `\http://localhost:8081/authorize`.
|External Callback Url | You can set this directly to `\http://localhost:8081/callback`.
|===

Here is the XML for the OAuth 2.0 configuration for Veeva Vault Connector:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<configuration-properties file="application.properties" />

<http:listener-config name="HTTP_Listener_config" >
    <http:listener-connection host="localhost" port="${http.port}" >
    </http:listener-connection>
</http:listener-config>

<veevavault:config name="Veeva_Vault_Config">
    <veevavault:oauth2-oidc-connection vaultURL="https://${veeva.instance}.veevavault.com" clientId="${veeva.client.id}" oidcProfileId="${veeva.oidc.profile}">
        <veevavault:oauth-authorization-code consumerKey="${azure.client.id}" consumerSecret="${azure.client.secret}" authorizationUrl="https://login.microsoftonline.com/${azure.tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize" accessTokenUrl="https://login.microsoftonline.com/${azure.tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/token" scopes="${azure.appid}/.default"/>
        <veevavault:oauth-callback-config listenerConfig="HTTP_Listener_config" callbackPath="callback" authorizePath="authorize" externalCallbackUrl="${oauth2.callback_uri}"/>
    </veevavault:oauth2-oidc-connection>
</veevavault:config>
----

The above example uses the Salesforce authentication provider and requires you to create an `application.properties` file in your resources folder with this format:

----
http.port = 8080
oauth2.callback_uri = http://localhost:8080/callback

veeva.instance = your-veeva-instance
veeva.client.id = your-veeva-client-id
veeva.oidc.profile = your-oidc-id

azure.tenant = azure-tenant-id
azure.appid = azure-app-id
azure.client.id = azure-oauth-client-id
azure.client.secret = azure-oauth-client-secret
----

NOTE: Azure AD is a special case in which you must set the scope as `{app_id}/.default`. With other OAuth providers, you can use the predefined `openid offline_access` scopes unless other scopes are required.

[[view-app-log]]
== View the App Log

To check for problems, you can view the app log as follows:

* If you’re running the app from Anypoint Platform, the app log output goes to the Anypoint Studio console window.
* If you’re running the app using Mule from the command line, the app log output goes to your operating system console.

Unless the log file path is customized in the app’s log file (`log4j2.xml`), you can also access the app log in the default location `MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`. You can configure the location of the log path in the app log file `log4j2.xml`.

== Next Step

See xref:veevavault-connector-config-topics.adoc[Additional Configuration Information] for more configuration steps.

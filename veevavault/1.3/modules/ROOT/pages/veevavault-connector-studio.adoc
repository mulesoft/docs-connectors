= Use Studio to Configure Veeva Vault Connector 1.3 - Mule 4
:page-aliases: connectors::veevavault/veevavault-connector-studio.adoc


Add Veeva Vault Connector to a Mule project in Anypoint Studio, configure an input source for the Mule flow, and configure the connector.

To add and configure a connector in Studio:

. Create a Mule project.
. Add the connector to your Mule project
. Configure an input source for the connector's flow.
. Configure global elements for the connector.

If you are new to configuring Anypoint Connectors in Studio, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-config-use-studio.adoc[Use Studio to Configure a Connector].

== Create a Mule Project

In Anypoint Studio, create a new Mule project in which to add and configure the connector.

. In Anypoint Studio, from the main menu, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
. Enter a name for your Mule project, and click *Finish*.

== Add the Connector to the Mule Project

Add Veeva Vault Connector to a Mule project to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location, as well as add the required dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file.

. In the Mule Palette view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Modules to Project*, type "veeva" in the search field.
. In *Available modules*, click *Veeva Vault Connector - Mule 4* and click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that same connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.

== Configure an Input Source for the Flow

After adding the connector to your Mule project, configure an input source for the flow, such as *HTTP Listener* (HTTP Connector), or *Scheduler*.

== Configure the Connector

To use Veeva Vault Connector in your Mule app, configure a global Veeva Vault element that can be used by all Veeva Vault Connector operations in the application.

. To create a global Veeva Vault element, click the *Global Elements* tab at the bottom of the Studio canvas and click *Create*.
+
. In the *Choose Global Type* window, expand *Connector Configuration*, click *Veeva Vault Config*, and click *OK*.
+
. In the Veeva Vault Config window, in the *General* tab, enter the following configuration values:
+

+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|*Field* |*Description*
|*Name* |Enter a name for this configuration to reference it later.
|*Vault URL* |Enter the Veeva Vault instance URL.
|*Username* |Enter the Veeva Vault instance username.
|*Password* |Enter the password that corresponds to the username.
|*Version* |Enter the Veeva Vault instance version.
|*Client Id* |Enter the client ID to send with each request in the header for tracking purposes, in the format: `\{organisation}-{company\|team}`. +
The client ID is prefixed with "mulesoft" and has a suffix with "client-vaultconnector" internally, for example: `mulesoft-abcpharma-clinicalprod-client-vaultconnector`.
|===
+
In the previous image, the placeholder values refer to a configuration file placed in the folder (`src/main/resources`) of your project. Although you can hardcode your credentials into the global configuration properties, you can simplify maintenance and achieve better project reusability if you reference a configuration file that contains these values instead. Keeping these values in a separate file is useful if you need to deploy to different environments in which your access credentials differ (such as production, development, and QA). +
The following example is a snippet of the `configuration.yaml` file under the `src/main/resources/config` folder:
+
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
	#Veeva Vault details
	veeva:
		vaultURL: "https://xxxx-xxxx.veevavault.com"
		username: "someone@example.com"
		password: "xxxxxxx"
		version : "v20.1"
		clientId: "mulesoft-abcpharma-clinicalprod-client-vaultconnector"
----
+
The connection configuration performs basic authentication, which accepts the required Vault URL, username, and password parameters to connect to the Veeva Vault instance to retrieve the session. The retrieved session is used for sending requests by each operation configured in the Mule application.
. In the Veeva Vault Config window, in the *Advanced* tab, configure the burst API limit:
+
image::veevavault-connector-basic-authentication-advanced.png[]
+
*Burst API Limit Profile*
+
The burst API limit profile configuration to act upon if the specified burst API limit of the Veeva Vault API reaches the threshold of the configured value or is exceeded.
+
If *Burst API limit config* is enabled (default), then the connector evaluates the Veeva Vault API's response header (`X-VaultAPI-BurstLimitRemaining`) value against the specified API Limit threshold value. If the remaining burst API limit reaches or exceeds this threshold value, the connector waits for the specified amount of time to restart the count for the *Burst Limit Remaining*.
+
Following is an example from the application logs, showing a warning message at `2019-06-06 10:34:45,096` and subsequently waiting for five minutes before rerunning as shown in the next message at `2019-06-06 10:39:45,098`:

If the *Daily API Limit Exceed Profile* is enabled (default), then the connector evaluates the Veeva Vault API's response header (*X-VaultAPI-DailyLimitRemaining*) for the specified value of the threshold, and throws an exception indicating that the daily API limit is exceeded. The exception continues to be thrown for each job or request created until the daily limit is reset or rolled over the next day.

= Using Anypoint Studio to Configure Veeva Vault Connector 1.3 - Mule 4
:page-aliases: connectors::veevavault/veevavault-connector-studio.adoc, connectors::veevavault/veevavault-design-center.adoc

Anypoint Studio (Studio) editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.

To add and configure a connector in Studio:

. <<create-mule-project,Create a Mule project>>.
. <<add-connector-to-project,Add the connector to your Mule project>>.
. <<configure-source,Configure a source for the connector's flow>>.
. <<add-connector-operation,Add a connector operation to the flow>>.
. <<configure-global-element,Configure a global element for the connector>>.
. <<configure-other-fields,Configure the other connector fields>>.

When you run the connector, you can view the app log to check for problems in real time, as described in <<view-app-log,View the App Log>>.

If you are new to configuring connectors in Studio, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-config-use-studio.adoc[Using Anypoint Studio to Configure a Connector]. If, after reading this topic, you need additional information about the connector fields, see the xref:veevavault-connector-reference.adoc[Veeva Vault Reference].

[[create-mule-project]]
== Create a Mule Project

In Studio, create a new Mule project in which to add and configure the connector:

. In Studio, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
. Enter a name for your Mule project and click *Finish*.

[[add-connector-to-project]]
== Add the Connector to Your Mule Project

Add Veeva Vault Connector to your Mule project to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location and add the required dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file:

. In *Mule Palette*, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Dependencies to Project*, type `veeva vault` in the search field.
. Click Veeva Vault in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.

[[configure-source]]
== Configure a Source

A source initiates a flow when a specified condition is met.
You can configure one of these sources to use with Veeva Vault Connector:

* HTTP Listener +
Initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port
* Scheduler +
Initiates a flow when a time-based condition is met

For example, to configure an HTTP Listener source, follow these steps:

. In *Mule Palette*, select *HTTP > Listener*.
. Drag *Listener* to the Studio canvas.
. On the *Listener* configuration screen, optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. Specify a value for the *Path* field.
. Click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of the HTTP Listener source in the app.
. On the *General* tab, specify connection information for the connector.
. On the *TLS* tab, optionally specify the TLS information for the connector.
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

[[add-connector-operation]]
== Add a Connector Operation to the Flow

When you add a connector operation to your flow, you are specifying an action for that connector to perform.

To add an operation for Veeva Vault Connector, follow these steps:

. In *Mule Palette*, select *Veeva Vault* and then select the desired operation.
. Drag the operation onto the Studio canvas, next to the input source.

[[configure-global-element]]
== Configure a Global Element for the Connector

When you configure a connector, configure a global element that all instances of that connector in the app can use. Configuring a global element requires you to provide the authentication credentials that the connector requires to access the target Veeva Vault system. Veeva Vault Connector supports Basic authentication.

To configure the global element for Veeva Vault Connector, follow these steps:

. Select the operation in the Studio canvas.
. In the *General* configuration screen for the operation, click the *Add* icon to access the global element configuration fields.
. In the *General* tab, in *Connection*, select the <<basic-auth, Veeva Vault Config>> method to configure Basic authentication.
+
You can reference a configuration file that contains ANT-style property placeholders (recommended), or you can enter your authorization credentials in the global configuration properties. For information about the benefits of using property placeholders and how to configure them, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-connector-configuration-overview.adoc[Anypoint Connector Configuration].
. In the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

[[basic_auth]]
=== Basic Authentication

Enter the following information in the *General* tab of the *Global Element Properties* screen to configure Basic authentication:

[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|Name | Configuration name
|Vault URL | URL of the Veeva Vault instance required for the connection
|Username | Username used to initialize the session
|Password | Password used to authenticate the user
|Client Id | Client ID to send with each request header to the Veeva Vault instance for tracking purposes, in the format `\{organization}-{company/team}`. +

The client ID has the prefix `mulesoft` and the suffix `client-vaultconnector`, for example, `mulesoft-abcpharma-clinicalprod-client-vaultconnector`.
|===

The following image shows an example of configuring the *General* tab for Basic authentication:

image::basic-auth.png[Authentication fields completed in the *General* tab for Basic authentication]

Enter the following information in the *Advanced* tab of the *Global Element Properties* screen to configure the burst API limit for Basic authentication:

[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|Response Timeout | Maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, that the connector waits for the Veeva Vault response. If the maximum amount of time is exceeded, a timeout exception is thrown. The default is 30,000 milliseconds (30 seconds).
|Burst API Limit Profile | Burst API limit profile configuration to act upon if the specified burst API limit of the Veeva Vault API reaches or exceeds the configured threshold. +

If *Burst API limit config* is enabled (default), then the connector evaluates the Veeva Vault API's response header (`X-VaultAPI-BurstLimitRemaining`) value against the specified *API Limit Threshold* value. If the remaining burst API limit reaches or exceeds the specified *API Limit Threshold* value, the connector waits for the specified amount of time to restart the count of *Burst Limit Remaining*. +

The following example shows an application log with a warning message at `2019-06-06 10:34:45,096`, halting the process for five minutes, as shown in the next message at `2019-06-06 10:39:45,098`:

[[view-app-log]]
== View the App Log

To check for problems, you can view the app log as follows:

* If you’re running the app from Anypoint Platform, the app log output goes to the Anypoint Studio console window.
* If you’re running the app using Mule from the command line, the app log output goes to your operating system console.

Unless the log file path is customized in the app’s log file (`log4j2.xml`), you can also access the app log in the default location `MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`. You can configure the location of the log path in the app log file `log4j2.xml`.

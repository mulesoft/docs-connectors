Anypoint Connector for Veeva Vault (Veeva Vault Connector) enables you to connect Mule flows to the Veeva Vault platform using the Veeva Vault REST API.

Depending on the operations you configure, this connector works with the https://developer.veevavault.com/api/19.1/#authentication[Veeva Vault REST, bulk, and streaming APIs]. Each API call uses a JSON request or a CSV request and returns JSON input stream responses over an HTTPS connection. All required request headers, error handling, and HTTPS connection configurations are built into the connector.

For information about compatibility and fixed issues, see the Veeva Vault Connector Release Notes.

== Before You Begin

To use this connector, you must be familiar with:

* http://vaulthelp2.vod309.com/wordpress/vault-basics/[Veeva Vault]
* https://developer.veevavault.com/vql/#introduction-to-vault-queries[Vault Query Language (VQL)]
* Anypoint Connectors
* Mule runtime engine (Mule)
* Elements and global elements in a Mule flow
* How to create a Mule app using Anypoint Studio

Before creating an app, you must have:

* Credentials to access the Veeva Vault target resource
* Anypoint Platform
* Anypoint Studio version 7.3.5 or later

== Common Use Cases for the Connector

You can use Veeva Vault Connector in Mule applications as an outbound connector with CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete), query, export, and Spark validator operations on the following Veeva Vault objects:

* Documents +
Create, retrieve, update, delete, export
* Document Renditions +
Create, retrieve, delete
* Vault Object +
Create, retrieve, update, delete
* Picklists +
Retrieve
* Audit Trail +
Retrieve
* Query +
VQL query to query on documents, Vault objects, and workflows
* Spark validator +
Validates and verifies the Spark message with a signature that is triggered from Veeva Vault
* Invoke Rest API +
Invokes https://developer.veevavault.com/api/20.1/#documents[Veeva Vault Rest APIs] in which a specific connector operation does not already exist. To maintain https://developer.veevavault.com/docs/#api-rate-limits[API rate limits], use bulk APIs instead of single APIs.

== Connection Types

Veeva Vault connections use the Basic authentication type, which uses credentials to connect to a Veeva Vault instance and perform operations.

For information about configuring authentication types, see xref:veevavault-connector-studio.adoc#configure-global-element[Configure a Global Element for the Connector].

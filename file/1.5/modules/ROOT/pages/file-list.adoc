= List Files Using the File Connector
:page-aliases: connectors::file/file-list.adoc

Use the `List` operation to list the files and folders in the path pointed to by the `directoryPath`
parameter. The `List` operation returns an array of messages in which:

* Each message holds the file's content in its payload.
* The file's message attributes section carries the file's metadata (such as name, creation time, and size).
* The payload is empty if the element is a folder.

The `List` operation requires the `directoryPath` parameter, which represents the relative path of the directory to list, unless you specify the full path of the directory. The path is relative to the working directory value defined in the configuration referenced by the `config-ref` parameter. If no configuration is referenced, the working directory defaults to the value of the `user.home` system property. If the system property is not set, the connector fails to initialize.

For an example of setting a configuration, see
xref:index.adoc#connection_settings[File Connection Settings].

Next is an example of a `List` operation that references a file configuration and thus uses
a relative path:

[source,xml]
----
<file:list config-ref="File_Config" directoryPath="relativePath" />
----

As mentioned earlier, this returns an array of messages. In Anypoint Studio, DataSense displays the
metadata for the operation's output:

[IMPORTANT]
========
The `List` operation lists both directories and files, but for files it also returns a lazy stream of
the file's contents in the payload, which can then be directly consumed by other operations. This
means that you do not need to perform a `Read` operation after a `List` operation to access the file's content. See
<<Read Files Returned by List, Read Files Returned by List>> for an example.
========

[[read-files-returned]]
== Read Files Returned by List

The following example lists all files and folders in `directoryPath` and, in a `foreach` loop:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<file:list config-ref="File_Config" directoryPath="relativePath" />

<foreach>
    <choice>
        <when expression="#[not attributes.directory]">
            <logger message="Found file #[attributes.path] whose content is: #[payload]" />
        </when>
        <otherwise>
            <flow-ref name="process-directory" />
        </otherwise>
    </choice>
</foreach>
----

The `foreach` loop determines whether each element is a file or folder with a `choice` component.  If the element is a file, then a xref:mule-runtime::logger-component-reference.adoc[Logger] outputs its
path and contents. If the element is a directory, it is sent to another flow for processing.

There is no `Read` operation inside the `foreach` loop because, as mentioned earlier, the `List` operation already returns the file's content in the payload, (but in
a lazy manner), so there is no need to worry about performance or overhead when the stream is not
consumed in the end.

== List Files and Folders Within Subfolders

To list files or folders within any subfolders of the `directoryPath`, such as a recursive list, you
can set the `recursive` parameter to `true`.

[source,xml]
----
<file:list config-ref="File_Config" directoryPath="relativePath" recursive="true" />
----

[[file-matcher]]
== Filter Files by Matching Criteria

You can use the `<file:matcher>` element to filter files based on the matching criteria you use for
accepting or rejecting a file. Here is an example of file matching rules you can use:

.Example: File Matcher
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<file:matcher
  filenamePattern="a?*.{htm,html,pdf}"
  path-pattern="a?*.{htm,html,pdf}"
  createdSince="2019-06-03T13:21:58+00:00"
  createdUntil="2019-07-03T13:21:58+00:00"
  updatedSince="2019-05-03T13:21:58+00:00"
  updatedUntil="2019-06-03T13:21:58+00:00"
  accessedSince="2019-06-03T13:21:58+00:00"
  accessedUntil="2019-06-03T13:21:58+00:00"
  directory="true|false"
  regularFile="true|false"
  symbolicLink="true|false"
  minSize="0"
  maxSize="1024" />
----

All of the attributes above are optional and are ignored if not provided. They all relate to each other under an `AND` operator.


=== Top-level, Reusable Matcher

A file matcher can be a reusable element (a named top-level element) as shown in the following example:

For example:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<file:matcher name="smallFileMatcher" maxSize="100" />

<flow name="smallFiles">
  <file:list path="~/smallfiles" matcher="smallFileMatcher" />
  ...
</flow>
----

=== Inner Element, Non-Reusable Matcher

A matcher can be an inner element that is proprietary to a particular component (non-reusable) as shown in the following example:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="smallFiles">
	<file:list path="~/smallfiles">
        <file:matcher maxSize="100" />
	</file:list>
	...
</flow>
----

[[time-between-size-checks]]
== Time Between Size Checks Parameter

If you want to read the file contents returned by the `List` operation, but you are not sure if the file
is still being written to, you can use the `TimeBetweenSizeChecks` parameter, which works
with the `TimeBetweenSizeCheckUnit` parameter. Combined, these two parameters perform two size checks:

* One when the flow reaches a point where the stream is about to be consumed. The time check is not done in the `List` operation because `List` returns a lazy stream pointing to the file's content, so it makes sense to do the size check only when the stream is about to be consumed.
* Another check is performed after the wait time set by the `TimeBetweenSizeChecks` and `TimeBetweenSizeCheckUnit` parameters

If both size checks return the same file size, then the stream is consumed successfully. If the two size checks return different file sizes, then the file is still being written to, so the stream is not consumed and the operation fails with an error.

[[limit-sort]]
== Limit and Sort Number of Files Returned

In the *List* operation *Advanced* configuration tab, you can configure the *Subset* field to limit the number of files returned and then sort them. The limit and offset attributes are optional.

image::file-connector-subset.png[Subset configuration screen for List operation]

In the *Configuration XML* editor, the `<file:subset>` configuration looks like this:
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<file:subset criteria="DATE_CREATED" limit="5" offset="6" order="ASCENDING"/>
----

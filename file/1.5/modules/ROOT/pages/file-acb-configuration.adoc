[[configuring-trigger]]
== Configuring the Trigger For the Flow

A trigger (source) initiates a flow when a specified condition is met.
You can configure one of these triggers to use with File Connector:

* *On New or Upated File*
+
Triggers a flow for a newly created or modified file
* *HTTP > Listener* 
+
Initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port
* *Scheduler* 
+
Initiates a flow when a time-based condition is met
+
For more information, see xref:anypoint-code-builder::acb-component-scheduler.adoc[].

For example, to configure the *On New or Updated* trigger:

. Add the *On New or Updated* operation to the canvas UI.
. Click the *On New or Updated* operation on the canvas UI. 
. In the *General* tab, configure the following attributes:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Attribute | Description | Required
|Directory |Directory where polled files are located. | No
|Recursive |Uses files contained in sub-directories if selected. | No
|Matcher | Matcher used to filter events on files that don't meet the matcher's criteria. | No
| Watermark mode a|If selected, picks only files that were created or updated after the last poll was executed. 

Options include:

* DISABLED
* MODIFIED_TIMESTAMP
* CREATED_TIMESTAMP | No
|Time between size check | Wait time, in milliseconds, between size checks to determine if a file is ready to read. This allows a file write to complete before processing. Mule runtime performs two size checks and waits the specified amount of time between calls. If both checks return the same value, the file is ready to read. | No
|Time between size check unit | Time unit for *Time between size check*.| No
|Scheduling strategy | Triggers the flow's execution based on a time-based condition. This field is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See <<scheduling-strategy>>. | Yes 
3+| *Post processing action* 
|Auto delete | Deletes each processed file after it's processed, which causes all files obtained in the next poll to be treated as new files, if selected. | No
|Move to directory | Directory path to which to send each processed file after it processes. This is an alternative to *Auto delete* if you don't want to delete the file.| No
|Rename to | Renames a file to this value when it is moved. This attribute works in tandem with *Move to directory*. The connector retains the original file name if you don't configure this field. | No
|Apply post action when failed | Applies any of the post actions (*Auto delete* and *Move to directory*) in case the file processing fails if selected. If you de-select this option, no failed files are moved or deleted. | No
|Overwrite | Overwrites the target file when the destination file has the same name.| No

|Target Value | Expression that's evaluated against the operation's output. The outcome of this expression is stored in the target variable. | No
| Error Mappings a| Creates custom error types that you map to Mule error types. The mappings can help you further differentiate and group errors in your app. This attribute is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See xref:mule-runtime::mule-error-concept.adoc[]. | No
| Reconnection strategy a| When an operation in a Mule application fails to connect to an external server, the default behavior is for the operation to fail immediately and return a connectivity error. You can modify the default behavior by configuring the reconnection strategy for the operation. This attribute is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See xref:file-documentation.adoc#reconnect[Reconnect] and xref:file-documentation.adoc#reconnect-forever[Reconnect Forever], and <<configuring-reconnection-strategy>>. | No

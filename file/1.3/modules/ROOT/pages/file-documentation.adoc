File Connector v1.3

Anypoint Connector for File (File Connector) manipulates file systems mounted on a host operation system.

This class serves as both extension definition and configuration. Operations are based on the standard `BaseFileSystemOperations`.

== Configurations
---
[[config]]
=== Default Configuration

==== Parameters
[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%,.^20%,^.^5%", options="header"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | *x*
| Connection a| <<config_connection, Local FileSystem Connection>>
 | The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | | *x*
| Default write encoding (DEPRECATED) a| String |  This parameter is deprecated and is ignored. |  |
| <<time-between-size-check,Time Between Size Check>> a| Number |  Wait time between size checks to determine if a file is ready to read. This allows a file write to complete before processing. If no value is provided, the check is not performed. When enabled, Mule performs two size checks, waiting the specified time between calls. If both checks return the same value, the file is ready to be read. This attribute works in tandem with *Time between size check unit*. |  |
| Time Between Size Check Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  A *Time unit* that qualifies the *Time between size check* attribute. |  `MILLISECONDS` |
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform will expire the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime will actually purge the instances when it sees it fit. |  |
|===

==== Connection Types
[[config_connection]]
===== Local FileSystem Connection

A Connection Provider that provides instances of File System from instances of File Connector.


====== Parameters
[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%,.^20%,^.^5%", options="header"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Working Directory a| String |  The directory to consider the root of every relative path used with this connector. If not provided, it defaults to the value of the `user.home` system property. If that system property is not set, then the connector fails to initialize. |  |
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  When an application deploys, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to `true`, deployment fails if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy. |  |

[[copy]]
=== Copy

`<file:copy>`

Copies the file or directory specified in *Source Path* into the *Target Path*. The source path can be either a file or a directory. If it points to a directory, then it is copied recursively.

If the target path doesn't exist, and neither does its parent, then a parent folder is created if *Create parent directories* is set to `true`. If *Create parent directories* is set to `false`, then a `FILE:ILLEGAL_PATH` error is thrown.

If *Overwrite* is set to `true` and the target file already exists, then the target file is overwritten. Otherwise, a `FILE:FILE_ALREADY_EXISTS` error is thrown.

[[read]]
=== Read

`<file:read>`

Obtains the content and metadata of a file at a given path. The operation itself returns a Message which payload is a InputStream with the file's content, and the metadata is represent as a LocalFileAttributes object that's placed as the message `Message#getAttributes()` attributes.

If the lock parameter is set to true, then a file system level lock is placed on the file until the input stream this operation returns is closed or fully consumed. Because the lock is actually provided by the host file system, its behavior might change depending on the mounted drive and the operation system on which Mule is running. Take that into consideration before blindly relying on this lock.

This method also makes a best effort to determine the MIME type of the file being read. The file's extension is used to make an educated guess on the file's MIME type. The user also has the chance to force the output encoding and `mimeType` through the `outputEncoding` and `outputMimeType` optional parameters.

[[rename]]

`<file:rename>`


Renames the file pointed by the path to the name provided on the `to` parameter. The `to` argument should not contain any path separator. FILE:ILLEGAL_PATH is thrown if this precondition is not honored.

[[write]]
=== Write

`<file:write>`


Writes the content into the file pointed by path.

If the directory on which the file is attempting to be written doesn't exist, then the operation will either throw FILE:ILLEGAL_PATH error or create such folder depending on the value of the createParentDirectory.

If the file itself already exists, then the behavior depends on the supplied mode.

This operation also supports locking support depending on the value of the lock argument, but following the same rules and considerations as described in the read operation.

== Sources

[[listener]]
=== On New or Updated File

`<file:listener>`

Polls a directory looking for files that have been created or updated. One message is generated for each file that is found.

The key part of this functionality is how to determine that a file is actually new.

These are the strategies for that:

* Set the `autoDelete` parameter to `true`: This deletes each processed file after it has been processed, causing all files obtained in the next poll to be necessarily new.
* Set `moveToDirectory` parameter: This moves each processed file to a different directory after it has been processed, achieving the same effect as `autoDelete<` but without loosing the file.
* Use the watermarkMode parameter to only pick files that have been created/updated after the last poll was executed.

A matcher can also be used for additional filtering of files.

[[time-between-size-check]]
=== Time Between Size Check Parameter Behavior

The process of the Write operation on a file can take some time to complete and get the written-to file ready to be read or accessed.  Thereby, MuleSoft introduced the `timeBetweenSizeCheck` parameter to prevent an operation from accessing an incomplete file.
When you set this parameter, it verifies the file's size before accessing the file contents.
The verification validates that the file's size does not vary after
waiting for the amount of time specified by the parameters `timeBetweenSizeCheck` and `timeBetweenSizeCheckUnit`.
The `timeBetweenSizeCheck` parameter then indicates the time to wait between each
verification, which is performed twice. If the file's size remains the same during both times, this assumes that the Write operation is complete and the access operation can continue, otherwise an exception is thrown.
The performed wait indicates that the thread executing
the operation goes to sleep for the indicated period of time. This wait is realized
at the moment of retrieving the content of the file. If the flow never accesses
the content of the file, the check is not done.

[NOTE]
Mule runtime engine version 4.1 and 4.2 users: because this wait can take place in multiple message processors, the File Connector
has no control over which thread is the one performing the wait. This means that any thread
from any thread pool, even a cpu-intensive thread, which is not meant for this kind of task, can be the one performing such wait.

= Copy and Move Files - Mule 4
:page-aliases: connectors::file/file-copy-move.adoc

Anypoint Connector for File (File Connector) provides the *Copy* and *Move* operations that enable you to copy or move files or directories on demand. 

* *Source path* +
The directory path name or file name to copy or move. If a file or directory already exists and the *Overwrite* field is set to `false`, the connector throws the message `FILE:FILE_ALREADY_EXISTS`.

* *Target path* +
 The directory path name into which to copy or move the file. If a target path doesn't exist, and neither does its parent, the connector attempts to create the path depending on the value of the *Create parent directories* argument. If *Create parent directories* is `false`, then `FILE:ILLEGAL_PATH` occurs.

* *Rename to* +
Renames the file as part of the operation. Set this field with a file name instead of a path. The connector retains the original file name if you do not configure this field.

== Configure the Copy Operation in Studio

. In the *Mule Palette* view, search for `file` and select the *Copy* operation.
. Drag the *Copy* operation onto the Studio canvas.
. In the *General* tab of the operation configuration screen, click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to access the global element configuration fields.
. Specify the connection information and click *OK*.
. Set *Source path* to the path of the file to copy, for example, `Documents/source-folder/file.txt`.
. Set *Target path* to the directory path into which to copy the file, for example, `Documents/target-folder`.
. Set *Rename to* to rename the file as part of the operation, for example, `renamed.txt`. +
This field must be a filename, not a path. If this attribute is not provided, the original filename is used.

In the *Configuration XML* editor, the `<file:copy>` configuration looks like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="file-connector-testFlow" >
		<http:listener config-ref="HTTP_Listener_config" path="/copy"/>
		<file:copy doc:name="Copy" sourcePath="Documents/source-folder/file.txt" targetPath="Documents/target-folder" config-ref="File_Config" overwrite="true" renameTo="renamed.txt"/>
	</flow>

.Example: File Listener (On New File Trigger)
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="onNewFile">
    <file:listener config-ref="file" directory="test-data/in" autoDelete="true">
      <scheduling-strategy>
        <fixed-frequency frequency="1000"/>

== Watermarking

For the File connector, the watermarking strategy can be used in two different modes: `CREATION_TIMESTAMP` or `MODIFIED_TIMESTAMP`. The strategy depends on whether you want to filter files based on their creation or modification time.

.Example: Watermarking with the File Listener
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<file:listener doc:name="On New File"
  config-ref="File_Config1"
  watermarkMode="CREATED_TIMESTAMP">
    <scheduling-strategy >
      <fixed-frequency />
    </scheduling-strategy>
</file:listener>

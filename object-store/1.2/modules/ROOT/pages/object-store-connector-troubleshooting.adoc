= Troubleshooting Object Store Connector - Mule 4

To troubleshoot Anypoint Connector for Object Store (Object Store Connector), become familiar with the information about enabling verbose logging and interpreting commonly thrown messages.

== Enable Verbose Logging

To get a better understanding of why an application's interaction fails with Object Store Connector, temporarily enable verbose logging for the connector. +

Remember to always disable the enhanced verbosity after troubleshooting, because it affects your Mule application performance.

To enable verbose logging in the configuration file:

. Access Anypoint Studio and navigate to the *Package Explorer* view.
. Open your application's project name.
. Open the `src/main/resources` path folder.
. Open the `log4j2.xml` file inside the folder.
. Add an `<AsyncLogger>` tag inside the `<Loggers>` tag:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<Loggers>
	...
	 <AsyncLogger name="org.mule.extension.objectstore" level="DEBUG"/>
	...
</Loggers>
----
[start=6]
. Save your application changes.
. Click the project name in *Package Explorer* and then click *Run* > *Run As* > *Mule Application*.

== Understand Common Throws

Here is a list of common throw messages and how to interpret them:

* OS:KEY_ALREADY_EXISTS

 The Mule app tries to store an object, but the object store already has a value for that key.

* OS:STORE_NOT_AVAILABLE

 Cannot access the object store at this time.

* OS:INVALID_KEY

The supplied key is invalid. Keys cannot be null nor blank.

* OS:KEY_NOT_FOUND

The object store must access a value, but the supplied key doesn't exist in that store.

* OS:NULL_VALUE

A null value was supplied to the object store. Null values are not supported.

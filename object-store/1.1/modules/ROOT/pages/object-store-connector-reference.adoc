Object Store Connector v1.1.3

Support Category: Select

+++
Connector that provides functionality to access and create object store instances.
+++


== Configurations
---
[[config]]
=== Config

+++
Default configuration
+++

==== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x
| Connection a| <<config_connection, Connection>>
 | The connection types to provide to this configuration. | | x
|===

==== Connection Types

[[config_connection]]
===== Connection

+++
A ConnectionProvider that returns the Mule runtime's default ObjectStoreManager.
+++

====== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  +++When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to true, deployment fails if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy.+++ |  |
|===

== Operations

[[clear]]
=== Clear

`<os:clear>`

Removes all the contents in the store.

==== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Object Store a| One of:

* <<objectStore>>
* <<objectStorev2>>
* <<privateObjectStore>> |  +++A reference to the object store to use. If not defined, the runtime's default partition is used.+++ |  |
|===

==== Throws

* OS:STORE_NOT_AVAILABLE


[[contains]]
=== Contains

`<os:contains>`

Checks if there is any value associated to the given key. If no value exists for the key, then false is returned.

This operation is synchronized at the key level. No other operation can access the same key on the same object store while this operation is running. If the runtime is running in cluster mode, this synchronization is also guaranteed across nodes.

==== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Key a| String |  +++The key of the object to be checked.+++ |  | x
| Object Store a| One of:

* <<objectStore>>
* <<objectStorev2>>
* <<privateObjectStore>> |  +++A reference to the object store to use. If not defined, the runtime's default partition is used.+++ |  |
| Target Variable a| String |  +++The name of a variable to store the operation's output.+++ |  |
| Target Value a| String |  +++An expression to evaluate against the operation's output and store the expression outcome in the target variable.+++ |  `#[payload]` |
|===

==== Output

[%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Type |Boolean
|===

==== Throws

* OS:INVALID_KEY
* OS:STORE_NOT_AVAILABLE

[[remove]]
=== Remove

`<os:remove>`

Removes the value associated to the given key. If no value exists for the key, then an OS:KEY_NOT_FOUND error is thrown.

This operation is synchronized on the key level. No other operation is able to access the same key on the same object store while this operation is running.

If the runtime is running in cluster mode, this synchronization is also guaranteed across nodes.

==== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Key a| String |  +++The key of the object to be removed.+++ |  | x
| Object Store a| One of:

* <<objectStore>>
* <<objectStorev2>>
* <<privateObjectStore>> |  +++A reference to the object store to use. If not defined, the runtime's default partition will be used.+++ |  |
|===

==== Throws

* OS:INVALID_KEY
* OS:STORE_NOT_AVAILABLE
* OS:KEY_NOT_FOUND

[[retrieve]]
=== Retrieve

`<os:retrieve>`

Retrieves the value stored for the given key. If no value exists for the key, behavior depends on the defaultValue parameter.

If the parameter was not provided or was resolved to a null value, then an OS:KEY_NOT_FOUND error is thrown. Otherwise, the defaultValue is returned, but that value is not stored.

Finally, this operation is synchronized on the key level. No other operation can access the same key on the same object store while this operation is running. If the runtime is running in cluster mode, this synchronization is also guaranteed across nodes.

==== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Key a| String |  +++The key of the value to be retrieved.+++ |  | x
| Default Value a| Any |  +++Value to be returned if the key doesn't exist in the store.+++ |  |
| Object Store a| One of:

* <<objectStore>>
* <<objectStorev2>>
* <<privateObjectStore>> |  +++A reference to the object store to use. If not defined, the runtime's default partition is used.+++ |  |
| Target Variable a| String |  +++The name of a variable to store the operation's output.+++ |  |
| Target Value a| String |  +++An expression to evaluate against the operation's output and store the expression outcome in the target variable.+++ |  `#[payload]` |
|===

* OS:STORE_NOT_AVAILABLE

[[store]]
=== Store

`<os:store>`

Stores the given value using the given key. This operation can be used either for storing new values or updating existing ones, depending on the value of the failIfPresent. When that parameter is set to `false` (default value), then any pre-existing value associated with that key is overwritten. If the parameter is set to `true`, then an `OS:KEY_ALREADY_EXISTS` error is thrown instead.

Another important consideration is regarding null values. It is not allowed to store a null value. However, a common use case is to obtain a value (most likely by evaluating a expression or transformation), testing the value for not null, storing it if present and doing nothing otherwise. The `failOnNullValue` parameter simplifies this use case. Setting it to `false` makes the connector skip null values, which prevents the need to use a `<choice/>` router to check the condition, while using the default value of `true` makes the connector throw a `NULL_VALUE` error.

Finally, this operation is synchronized on the key level. No other operation can access the same key on the same object store while this operation is running. If the runtime is running in cluster mode, this synchronization is also guaranteed across nodes.

==== Parameters

|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Key a| String |  +++The key of the value to be stored.+++ |  | x
| Value a| Any a|  The value to be stored. Should not be null if `failOnNullValue` is set to true. a|  `#[payload]` |
| Fail If Present a| Boolean |  +++Whether to fail or update the pre-existing value if the key already exists on the store.+++ |  +++false+++ |
| Fail On Null Value a| Boolean |  +++Whether to fail or skip the operation if the value is null.+++ |  +++true+++ |
| Object Store a| One of:

* <<objectStore>>
* <<objectStorev2>>
* <<privateObjectStore>> |  +++A reference to the object store to use. If not defined, the runtime's default partition is used.+++ |  |
|===

==== Throws

* OS:INVALID_KEY
* OS:KEY_ALREADY_EXISTS
* OS:NULL_VALUE

[[objectStore]]
=== Object Store

NOTE: These settings do not apply to xref:object-store::index.adoc[Object Store v2].

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Persistent a| Boolean | Whether the store is persistent or transient. | true |
| Max entries a| Number | The max number of entries allowed. Exceeding entries are removed when the expiration thread runs. If absent, then the described object store has no size boundaries. |  |
| Entry ttl a| Number | The entry timeout. If absent, then the described object store has no time boundaries. |  |
| Entry ttl unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS

** HOURS
** DAYS a| An entry's time to live (`#entryTtl`). | SECONDS |
| Expiration interval a| Number a| How frequently the expiration thread should run. The default value is 1 minute.

The `expirationInterval` field requires that the `maxEntries` or `entryTtl` fields also be set. If neither is set, then putting a value in `Expiration Interval` has no effect and the expiration thread does not run.
If `expirationInterval` is set to a value lower than or equal to zero, then the object store never expires. | 1 |

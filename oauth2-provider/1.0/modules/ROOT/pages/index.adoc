OAuth2 Provider Module v1.0

[[oauth2-provider-reference]]

The OAuth2 Provider module allows a Mule runtime engine (Mule) app to be configured as an Authentication Manager in an OAuth2 dance.
With this role, the application will be able to authenticate previously registered clients, grant tokens, validate tokens, or register and delete clients, all during the execution of a flow.

The following documentation assumes a basic knowledge of the OAuth2 authorization protocol. For further reference, see the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749[RFC-6749].

If the app behaves as the client in the OAuth2 dance, use the xref:oauth-module::index.adoc[OAuth Module] instead.

`<oauth2-provider:revoke-token>`


Revokes an access token or refresh token, invalidating the related refresh token or access token as well. If client credentials need to be validated, use the validateClient credential before revoking the token.

[[validateToken]]
=== Validate Token

`<oauth2-provider:validate-token>`

Checks that a valid access token is provided. Validates that the given token was granted and is in a valid state. Also, if defined, checks that the token scopes or resource owner roles match the provided ones.

If the provided token is valid, the operation sets the payload as a JSON with the following information:

* expires_in:
+
Time remaining for the token to be considered invalid, in seconds.
+
* scope:
+
Space separated scopes associated with the token.
+
* client_id:

ID of the client that requested this token.
+
* username:
+
Username of the resource owner that authorized this token to be requested.

To preserve the payload set before executing the operation, you can use the  `target` and `targetValue` attributes to set the JSON information in a variable instead of overwriting the payload.

`<oauth2-provider:client-scope value="USER"/>`|  |
| Client Authorized Grant Types a| Array of Enumeration, one of:

** AUTHORIZATION_CODE
** REFRESH_TOKEN

== OAuth Dance

Because the OAuth dance is done through HTTP, the OAuth2 Provider makes use of the xref:http-connector::index.adoc[Mule HTTP Connector].

As a consequence, apart from the definition of an OAuth2 provider configuration, the Mule application must also have an HTTP Listener configuration to be used by the provider.

Once configured, the provider works as follows:

Two HTTP endpoints are created for listening to Authentication Code and Token request as stated by the OAuth2 definition. Those work independently from the Mule application and respond via HTTP.

The provider defines an operation: <<validateToken>> that can check if a token is authorized. That operation can be added anywhere in a flow to control its execution. If the token is indeed authorized,
the flow continues executing, setting token information in the payload; otherwise, a `TOKEN_UNAUTHORIZED` error is raised. You need to add the operation to the parts of the application that require token authorization.

Since token validation is almost always used together with an HTTP Listener, in case it fails, the Listener's response mechanism can handle the error and properly respond to the requester. Additional logic can be added for handling that type of error.

Lastly, additional operations are provided to add or delete clients and to revoke tokens if needed.

== Security Providers

As seen in the <<general-configuration>>, two security providers should be defined in the app to be later referenced by the OAuth2 Configuration element.

One way of doing this is using the Spring Framework, defining both security providers, and then using the xref:spring-module::index.adoc[Spring Module] to add the providers to the Mule Security Manager:

[source,xml,linenums]

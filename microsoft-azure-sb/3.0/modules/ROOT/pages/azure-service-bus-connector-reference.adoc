== Configurations


==== Parameters
[%header,cols="20s,20a,35a,20a,5a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | Name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x
| Connection a| <<config_sas-connection, Shared Access Signature>>
 | The connection types to provide to this configuration. | | x
| Send Correlation Strategy a| Enumeration, one of:

** AUTO
** ALWAYS
** NEVER |  Whether to specify a correlation ID when publishing messages. This applies both for custom correlation IDs specified at the operation level and for default correlation IDs taken from the current event. |  AUTO | 
| Zone Id a| String |  Zone ID property is used to identify the rules used to convert between an Instant and LocalDateTime. If the Zone ID equals `Z`, UTC is used. If the Zone ID is not specified, the system default Zone ID is used. |  | 
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> | Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before Mule considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the instance expires at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. Mule purges the instances as appropriate. |  |

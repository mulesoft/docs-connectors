= Azure Service Bus Connector 3.1 - Mule 4

Support Category: https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#anypoint-connectors[Select]


Anypoint Connector for Azure Service Bus (Azure Service Bus Connector) makes it easy to build integrations that send messages to and receive messages from Azure Service Bus, which is an asynchronous messaging cloud platform. This connector supports communication with queues and topics and can perform actions such as:

* Send to queue
* Send to topic
* Receive from queue
* Receive from subscription

To use the Azure management API for CRUD operations of queues, topics, subscriptions, and rules, use Anypoint Connector for Azure Service Bus Management (Azure Service Bus Management Connector).

[NOTE]
This connector supports integrations with Azure Service Bus (cloud). It does not work with Microsoft Service Bus (on-premises). To connect with Microsoft Service Bus on-premises, use Anypoint Connector for Microsoft Service Bus. 

For compatibility information and fixed issues, see the release notes.

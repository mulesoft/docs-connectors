 | The connection types to provide to this configuration. | | x
| Send Correlation Strategy a| Enumeration, one of:

** AUTO
** ALWAYS
** NEVER |  Whether to specify a correlation ID when publishing messages. This applies both for custom correlation IDs specified at the operation level and for default correlation IDs taken from the current event. |  AUTO | 
| Zone Id a| String |  Zone ID property is used to identify the rules used to convert between an Instant and LocalDateTime. If the Zone ID equals `Z`, UTC is used. If the Zone ID is not specified, the system default Zone ID is used. |  |

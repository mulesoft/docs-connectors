[[abortMultipartUpload]]
=== Abort Multipart Upload
`<s3:abort-multipart-upload>`

Aborts a multipart upload. After a multipart upload is aborted, no additional parts can be uploaded using that upload ID. The storage consumed by any previously uploaded parts will be freed. However, if any part uploads are currently in progress, those part uploads might or might not succeed. As a result, it might be necessary to abort a given multipart upload multiple times to completely free all storage consumed by all parts.

[[copyObject]]
=== Copy Object
`<s3:copy-object>`

Copies a source object to a new destination. To copy an object, the caller's account must have read access to the source object and write access to the destination bucket. By default, all object metadata for the source object is copied to the new destination object, unless new object metadata is specified.

The access control list (ACL) is not copied to the new object, and is set to `PRIVATE` unless a new ACL is specified.

If no destination bucket is specified, the same bucket as the source bucket is used (local copy). The estimation object's *Content-Type* HTTP header is set with the specified value. If it is passed `null`, then the default MIME type `application/octet-stream` is set.

[[createBucket]]
=== Create Bucket
`<s3:create-bucket>`

Creates a new bucket. The connector must not be configured as anonymous for this operation to succeed. Bucket names must be unique across all of Amazon S3, that is, among all Amazon S3 users. Bucket ownership is similar to the ownership of Internet domain names. Within Amazon S3, only a single user owns each bucket. Once a uniquely named bucket is created in Amazon S3, you can organize and name the objects within the bucket in any way.

Ownership of the bucket is retained as long as the owner has an Amazon S3 account. To conform with DNS requirements, buckets names must be between 3 and 63 characters long. They must not contain underscores, adjacent periods, dashes next to periods, or uppercase characters. They must also not end with a dash.

Do not make bucket create or delete calls in the high availability code path of an application. Create or delete buckets in a separate initialization or setup.

[[deleteBucketWebsiteConfiguration]]
=== Delete Bucket Website Configuration
`<s3:delete-bucket-website-configuration>`


Removes the website configuration for a bucket. This operation requires the DeleteBucketWebsite permission. By default, only the bucket owner can delete the website configuration attached to a bucket. However, bucket owners can grant other users permission to delete the website configuration by writing a bucket policy granting them the `S3:DeleteBucketWebsite` permission.

Invoking this operation on a bucket with no website configuration doesn't fail. Invoking this operation on a non-existing bucket fails.

=== Delete Object
`<s3:delete-object>`


Deletes a given object. Only the owner of the bucket containing the version can perform this operation. If a version is specified, versioning must be enabled.

Once deleted, there is no method to restore the version. Otherwise, once deleted, the object can only be restored if versioning is enabled when the object was deleted. If you attempt to delete an object that does not exist, Amazon S3 returns a success message instead of an error message.

[[getObject]]
=== Get Object
`<s3:get-object>`

Returns the object stored in Amazon S3 under the specified bucket and key. Returns null if the specified constraints are not met. To get an object from Amazon S3, the caller must have com.amazonaws.services.s3.model.Permission#Read access to the object.

Callers must be very careful when using this operation because the returned Amazon S3 object contains a direct stream of data from the HTTP connection. The underlying HTTP connection cannot be closed until the user finishes reading the data and closes the stream. Regarding conditional get constraints, Amazon S3 ignores any future dates.

Default value is 100 instances. |  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This is by how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of `0` or lower means that the buffer must not expand, meaning that a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error is raised when the buffer gets full. Default value is 100 instances. |  |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | Maximum amount of memory to use. If more than that is used, a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error is raised. A value lower than or equal to `0` means no limit. |  |

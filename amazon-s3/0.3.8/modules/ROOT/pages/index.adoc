= Amazon S3 Connector
:page-aliases: 3.8@mule-runtime::amazon-s3-connector.adoc

Support Category: Select

The Anypoint Amazon S3 Connector provides connectivity to the the Amazon S3 API, enabling you to interface with Amazon S3 to store objects, download and use data with other AWS services, and build applications that call for internet storage.

Instant access to the Amazon S3 API enables seamless integrations between Amazon S3 and other databases, CMS applications such as Drupal, and CRM applications such as Salesforce. Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is storage for the Internet. You can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web. You can accomplish these tasks using the simple and intuitive web interface of the AWS Management Console.

The AWS SDK for Java provides a Java API for AWS infrastructure services. The Amazon S3 connector is built using the SDK for Java.

== Prerequisites

To use the Amazon S3 connector, you must have the following:

* Access to Amazon Web Services.
* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials.
* Anypoint Studio Enterprise edition.

This document assumes that you are familiar with Amazon S3, Mule, Anypoint Connectors, Anypoint Studio, elements in a Mule flow, and global elements.

=== Compatibility

Amazon S3 connector is compatible with:

[%header,cols="20a,80a",width=70%]
|===
|Application/Service|Version
|Mule Runtime|3.5.0 or later
|AWS SDK for Java|1.11.515
|===


== To Install this Connector

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio taskbar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange.
. Search for the connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

When Studio has an update, a message displays in the lower right corner, which you can click to install the update.

When prompted:

. Select the *Amazon S3 connector version 4.3.0* check box and click *Next*.
. Follow the instructions provided by the user interface.
. Restart Studio when prompted. After restarting, if you have several versions of the connector installed, Mule asks you for the version of the connector to use.

== Configuring the Connector Global Element

To use the Amazon S3 connector in your Mule application, configure a global Amazon S3 element that can be used by all the Amazon S3 connectors in the application (read more about  xref:3.8@mule-runtime::global-elements.adoc[Global Elements].)

[.ex]
=====
[discrete.view]
=== Studio Visual Editor

. Click the *Global Elements* tab at the base of the canvas, then click *Create*.
. In the *Choose Global Type* window, expand *Connector Configuration*, and click *Amazon S3: Configuration*.
+
image::ams3_01.png[]
+
. Click *Ok*
. Enter the global element properties:
+
image::amazon-s3-connector-111d7.png[ams3_02]
+
[%header,cols="30a,70a",width=80%]
|===
|Parameter|Description
|*Name*|Enter a name for the configuration to reference it.
|*Access Key*|Alphanumeric text string that uniquely identifies the user who owns the account.
|*Secret Key*|Key that plays the role of a password.
|*Try Default AWS Credentials Provider Chain*|Checkbox that controls whether temporary credentials should be used.
|*S3 Compatible Storage URL*|Optional URL of S3 compatible storage if Amazon S3 is not used.
|===
+
[NOTE]
In the image above, the placeholder values refer to a configuration file placed in the
`src` folder of your project. See xref:3.8@mule-runtime::configuring-properties.adoc[Learn how to configure properties].

You can either enter your credentials into the global configuration properties, or reference a configuration file that contains these values. For simpler maintenance and better re-usability of your project, Mule recommends that you use a configuration file. Keeping these values in a separate file is useful if you need to deploy to different environments, such as production, development, and QA, where your access credentials differ. See
xref:3.8@mule-runtime::deploying-to-multiple-environments.adoc[Deploying to Multiple Environments] for instructions on how to manage this.

. Keep the *Pooling Profile* and the *Reconnection tabs* with their default entries.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that the parameters of your global configuration are accurate, and that Mule is able to successfully connect to your instance of Amazon S3. Read more about this in  xref:6@studio::testing-connections.adoc[Testing Connections].
. Click *OK* to save the global connector configurations.

=== Connecting to S3 Compatible Storage

If you need to connect to a different storage than the default AWS S3, you must specify its URL in the `S3 Compatible Storage URL` field.

An example of S3 compatible storage is the https://github.com/minio[minio project]. For instance, if you configure it locally you may need to set the `S3 Compatible Storage URL` to `+http://127.0.0.1:9000+`

== Using the Connector


Amazon S3 connector is an operation-based connector, which means that when you add the connector to your flow, you need to configure a specific operation for the connector to perform. The Amazon S3 connector currently supports the following list of operations:

[NOTE]
See the full list of operations for the latest version of the connector http://mulesoft.github.io/mule3-amazon-s3-connector/[here].

For the operations to work, you need to enable or update the subset of the overall list of Amazon S3 actions on the bucket to specify that the AWS account has access to the subset actions on the bucket.

* Abort Multipart Upload
* Complete Multipart Upload
* Copy Object
* Create Bucket
* Create Object
* Create Object Presigned URI
* Delete Bucket

* Upload Part Copy

=== Using AWS KMS Master Key

If you need to encrypt the objects that you are going to store to S3 buckets using customer managed master keys, then you must specify Customer Master Key Id in the 'KMS Master Key' field in the Create Object configuration.

=== Using AWS Credentials Provider Chain in CloudHub

With Default AWS Credentials Provider Chain, the user can specify the access key and secret in the CloudHub environment with these steps:

. Use the following configuration to prepare a mule app.
+
[source,xml]
----
 <s3:config name="Amazon_S3__Configuration" accessKey="dummy" secretKey="dummy" doc:name="Amazon S3: Configuration" tryDefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain="true"/>
----
+
. Export this to get a deployable zip archive.
. Deploy to cloudhub and set the properties `aws.accessKeyId` and `aws.secretKey` through `Runtime Manager > Settings > Properties`.
. Finish deployment and test.
+
Observe that access key and secret key are not mentioned in the connector config and the correct values are used from the values specified in the settings. More information about Default AWS Credentials Provider Chain can be found here at  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html#using-the-default-credential-provider-chain[using the default provider credential chain]


=== Connector Namespace and Schema

When designing your application in Studio, the act of dragging the connector from the palette onto the Anypoint Studio canvas should automatically populate the XML code with the connector *namespace* and *schema location*.

*Namespace:* `+http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/connector+`
*Schema Location:* `+http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/s3/current/mule-connector.xsd+`

[TIP]
If you are manually coding the Mule application in Studio's XML editor or other text editor, paste these into the header of your *Configuration XML*, inside the `<mule>` tag.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<mule xmlns:connector="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/connector"
  ...
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/connector http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/connector/current/mule-connector.xsd">
  ...
  <flow name="yourFlow">
  ...
  </flow>
</mule>
----

=== Using the Connector in a Mavenized Mule App

If you are coding a Mavenized Mule application, this XML snippet must be included in your `pom.xml` file.

[source,xml,linenums]

:page-aliases: 3.9@mule-runtime::amazon-s3-connector.adoc

Support Category: https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#anypoint-connectors[Select]

Anypoint Connector for Amazon S3 (Amazon S3 Connector) provides connectivity to the the Amazon S3 API, enabling you to interface with Amazon S3 to store objects, download and use data with other AWS services, and build apps that call for internet storage.

Instant access to the Amazon S3 API enables seamless integrations between Amazon S3 and other databases, CMS apps such as Drupal, and CRM apps such as Salesforce.
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is storage for the internet. You can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web. You can accomplish these tasks using the simple and intuitive web interface of the AWS Management Console.

The AWS SDK for Java provides a Java API for AWS infrastructure services. The Amazon S3 connector is built using the SDK for Java.

// Reference: https://mulesoft.github.io/mule3-amazon-s3-connector/[Amazon S3 Technical Reference]

== Prerequisites

To use Amazon S3 Connector, you must have the following:

* Access to Amazon Web Services
* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials
* Anypoint Studio Enterprise edition

This document assumes that you are familiar with Amazon S3, Mule, Anypoint Connectors, Anypoint Studio, elements in a Mule flow, and global elements.

=== Compatibility

Amazon S3 Connector is compatible with:

[%header,cols="20s,80a",width=70%]
|===
|App/Service|Version
|Mule |3.5.0 or later
|AWS SDK for Java|1.11.515
|===

== Install the Connector

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio taskbar.
. Sign in to Exchange with your Anypoint Platform credentials.
. From Anypoint Exchange, click *Provided by MuleSoft*.
. Search for the Mule 3 connector and click *Install*.

When Studio has an update, a message displays in the lower right corner, which you can click to install the update.

== Configure a Global Element

To use Amazon S3 Connector in your Mule app, configure a global Amazon S3 element that can be used by all the Amazon S3 connectors in the app (read more about xref:3.9@mule-runtime::global-elements.adoc[Global Elements]).

. Click the *Global Elements* tab at the base of the canvas, then click *Create*.
. In the *Choose Global Type* window, expand *Connector Configuration*, and click *Amazon S3: Configuration*.
+
image::ams3_01.png[]
+
. Click *Ok*
. Enter the global element properties:
+
image::amazon-s3-connector-111d7.png[ams3_02]
+
[%header,cols="30s,70a",width=80%]
|===
|Parameter|Description
|*Name*|Enter a name for the configuration to reference it.
|*Access Key*|Alphanumeric text string that uniquely identifies the user who owns the account.
|*Secret Key*|Key that plays the role of a password.
|*Try Default AWS Credentials Provider Chain*|Checkbox that controls whether temporary credentials should be used.
|*S3 Compatible Storage URL*|Optional URL of S3 compatible storage if Amazon S3 is not used.
|===
+
In the image, the placeholder values refer to a configuration file in the
`src` folder of your project. See xref:3.9@mule-runtime::configuring-properties.adoc[Learn How to Configure Properties].

You can either enter your credentials into the global configuration properties, or reference a configuration file that contains these values. For simpler maintenance and better re-usability of your project, Mule recommends that you use a configuration file. Keeping these values in a separate file is useful if you need to deploy to different environments, such as production, development, and QA, where your access credentials differ. See
xref:3.9@mule-runtime::deploying-to-multiple-environments.adoc[Deploying to Multiple Environments] for instructions on how to manage this.

. Keep the *Pooling Profile* and the *Reconnection tabs* with their default entries.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that the parameters of your global configuration are accurate, and that Mule is able to successfully connect to your instance of Amazon S3. Read more about this in  xref:6@studio::testing-connections.adoc[Testing Connections].
. Click *OK* to save the global connector configurations.


=== Configure Using an XML Editor

First, ensure that you have included the Amazon S3 namespaces in your configuration file.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<mule xmlns:s3="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/s3"
  xmlns:http="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/http"
  xmlns:tracking="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ee/tracking"
  xmlns="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core"
  xmlns:doc="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/documentation"
  xmlns:spring="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-current.xsd

  <!-- Put your flows and configuration elements here -->

</mule>
----

Follow these steps to configure Amazon S3 Connector in your app:
Create a global Amazon S3 configuration outside and above your flows, using the following global configuration code.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<!-- simple configuration -->
<s3:config name="Amazon_S3_Configuration" accessKey="${s3.accessKey}" secretKey="${s3.secretKey}" doc:name="Amazon S3: Configuration"/>
----

[%header,cols="30s,70a",width=80%]
|===
|Parameter|Description
|*Name*|Enter a name for the configuration with which it can be referenced later by config-ref. The name in this example is `Amazon_S3_Configuration`.
|*accessKey*|The access key provided by Amazon. It is required for non-anonymous operations.
|*secretKey*|The secrete key provided by Amazon. It is required for non-anonynous operations.
|===

=====

=== Connect to S3-Compatible Storage

If you need to connect to a different storage than the default AWS S3, you must specify its URL in the `S3 Compatible Storage URL` field.

An example of S3 compatible storage is the https://github.com/minio[minio project]. For instance, if you configure it locally you may need to set the `S3 Compatible Storage URL` to `+http://127.0.0.1:9000+`

== Use the Connector


Amazon S3 connector is an operation-based connector, which means that when you add the connector to your flow, you need to configure a specific operation for the connector to perform. The Amazon S3 connector currently supports the following list of operations:

See the full list of operations for the latest version of the connector in the http://mulesoft.github.io/mule3-amazon-s3-connector/[Amazon S3 Technical Reference].

For the operations to work, you need to enable or update the subset of the overall list of Amazon S3 actions on the bucket to specify that the AWS account has access to the subset actions on the bucket.

=== Use the AWS KMS Master Key

If you need to encrypt the objects that you are going to store to S3 buckets using customer managed master keys, then you must specify Customer Master Key Id in the 'KMS Master Key' field in the Create Object configuration.

=== Use AWS Credentials Provider Chain in CloudHub

With Default AWS Credentials Provider Chain the user can specify the access key and secret in the CloudHub environment. Following are the steps with which this can be done:

. Use the following configuration to prepare a mule app.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
 <s3:config
  name="Amazon_S3__Configuration"
  accessKey="dummy"
  secretKey="dummy"
  doc:name="Amazon S3: Configuration"
  tryDefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain="true"/>
----
+
. Export this to get a deployable zip archive.
. Deploy to cloudhub and set the properties `aws.accessKeyId` and `aws.secretKey` through `Runtime Manager > Settings > Properties`.
. Finish deployment and test.
+
Observe that access key and secret key are not mentioned in the connector config and the correct values are used from the values specified in the settings. More information about Default AWS Credentials Provider Chain can be found here at  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html#using-the-default-credential-provider-chain[using the default provider credential chain]


=== Connector Namespace and Schema

When designing your app in Studio, the act of dragging the connector from the Mule Palette view onto the Anypoint Studio canvas should automatically populate the XML code with the connector namespace and schema location.

*Namespace:* `+http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/connector+` +
*Schema Location:* `+http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/s3/current/mule-connector.xsd+`

If you are manually coding the Mule app in Studio's XML editor or other text editor, paste these into the header of your configuration XML, inside the `<mule>` tag:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<mule xmlns:connector="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/connector"
  ...
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/connector
  http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/connector/current/mule-connector.xsd">
  ...
  <flow name="yourFlow">
  ...
  </flow>
</mule>
----

=== Use the Connector in a Mavenized Mule App

If you are coding a Mavenized Mule app, include this XML snippet in your `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.mule.modules</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-module-s3</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
</dependency>
----

Replace `x.x.x` with the version that corresponds to the connector you are using.

== Use Cases

The following are the common use cases for the Amazon S3 connector:

* Store an image from a URL on Amazon S3, then retrieve and display the image.
* Create an image link in Amazon S3 and update the status in twitter along with the image link.

=== Add the Connector to a Mule Flow

. Create a new Mule project in Anypoint Studio.
. Drag the Amazon S3 connector onto the canvas, then select it to open the properties editor.
. Configure the connector’s parameters:
+
image::ams3_03.png[]
+
[%header,cols="20s,50a,30a"]
|===
|Field|Description|Example
|*Display Name*|Enter a unique label for the connector in your app.|Amazon S3
|*Connector Configuration*|Select a global Amazon S3 connector element from the drop-drown.|N/A
|*Operation*|Select the action this component must perform.|Create bucket
|*Bucket Name*|Select a parameter for the operation.|#[payload] or `${bucketName}` to pick the value using MEL expression.
|===
+
. Save your configurations.

== Connector Performance

To define the pooling profile for the connector manually, access the *Pooling Profile* tab in the applicable global element for the connector.

For background information about pooling, see xref:3.9@mule-runtime::tuning-performance.adoc[Tuning Performance].

=== Demo: Store an Image from a URL

Create a Mule app that stores an image from a URL on Amazon S3, then retrieve and display the image.

[[AbortMultipartUpload]]
=== Abort Multipart Upload
`<s3:abort-multipart-upload>`

Aborts a multipart upload. After a multipart upload is aborted, no additional parts can be uploaded using that upload ID. The storage consumed by any previously uploaded parts will be freed. However, if any part uploads are currently in progress, those part uploads might or might not succeed. As a result, it might be necessary to abort a given multipart upload multiple times to completely free all storage consumed by all parts.

To verify that all parts are removed to avoid getting charged for the part storage, call the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListParts.html[ListParts] action and ensure that the parts list is empty. For information about permissions required to use the multipart upload, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html[Multipart Upload and Permissions].

[[CompleteMultipartUpload]]
=== Complete Multipart Upload
`<s3:complete-multipart-upload>`

Completes a multipart upload by assembling previously uploaded parts.

You first initiate the multipart upload and then upload all parts using the *Upload Part* operation. After successfully uploading all relevant parts of an upload, call this operation to complete the upload.

Upon receiving this request, Amazon S3 concatenates all the parts in ascending order by part number to create a new object. In the *Complete Multipart Upload* request, you must provide the parts list and ensure that it is complete.

This operation concatenates the parts that you provide in the list. For each part in the list, you must provide the part number and ETag value, which is returned after that part is uploaded.

Processing of a *Complete Multipart Upload* request could take several minutes to complete. After Amazon S3 begins processing the request, it sends an HTTP response header that specifies a `200 OK` response. While processing is in progress, Amazon S3 periodically sends white space characters to keep the connection from timing out. Because a request could fail after the initial `200 OK` response has been sent, it is important that you check the response body to determine whether the request succeeded.

Note that if *Complete Multipart Upload* fails, applications must be prepared to retry the failed requests.

[[CopyObject]]
=== Copy Object
`<s3:copy-object>`


Creates a copy of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3.

You can store individual objects of up to 5 TB in Amazon S3. You create a copy of your object up to 5 GB in size in a single atomic action using this API. However, to copy an object greater than 5 GB, you must use the multipart upload *Upload Part - Copy API*. For more information, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjctsUsingRESTMPUapi.html[Copy Object Using the REST Multipart Upload API].

All copy requests must be authenticated. Additionally, you must have read access to the source object and write access to the destination bucket. For more information, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html[REST Authentication].

Both the region that you want to copy the object from and the region that you want to copy the object to must be enabled for your account. A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy request or while Amazon S3 is copying the files. If the error occurs before the copy action starts, you receive a standard Amazon S3 error. If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error response is embedded in the `200 OK` response. This means that a `200 OK` response can indicate either success or an error.

Design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately. If the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about the copied object. If the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the response is chunk encoded. Otherwise, it does not contain the Content-Length, and you must read the entire body. The copy request charge is based on the storage class and region that you specify for the destination object. For pricing information, refer to http://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/[Amazon S3 pricing].

[[CreateMultipartUpload]]
=== Create Multipart Upload
`<s3:create-multipart-upload>`


Initiates a multipart upload and returns an upload ID. This upload ID is used to associate all of the parts in the specific multipart upload. You specify this upload ID in each of your subsequent upload part requests (refer to <<UploadPart>>).

You also include this upload ID in the final request to either complete or abort the multipart upload request. For more information about multipart uploads, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html[Multipart Upload Overview].

If you configure a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart uploads, the upload must complete within the number of days specified in the bucket lifecycle configuration. Otherwise, the incomplete multipart upload becomes eligible for an abort action and Amazon S3 aborts the multipart upload. For more information, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html#mpu-abort-incomplete-mpu-lifecycle-config[Aborting Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Policy].

For information about the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html[Uploading and Copying Objects Using Multipart Upload]. After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to stop being charged for storing the uploaded parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and stops charging you for storing them only after you either complete or abort a multipart upload.

[[DeleteBucketLifecycleConfiguration]]
=== Delete Bucket Lifecycle Configuration
`<s3:delete-bucket-lifecycle-configuration>`


Deletes the lifecycle configuration from the specified bucket. Amazon S3 removes all the lifecycle configuration rules in the lifecycle subresource associated with the bucket. Your objects never expire, and Amazon S3 no longer automatically deletes any objects on the basis of rules contained in the deleted lifecycle configuration.

To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration action. By default, the bucket owner has this permission and the bucket owner can grant this permission to others.

There is usually some time lag before lifecycle configuration deletion is fully propagated to all the Amazon S3 systems.

[[DeleteBucketPolicy]]
=== Delete Bucket Policy
`<s3:delete-bucket-policy>`


This implementation of the DELETE action uses the policy subresource to delete the policy of a specified bucket. If you are using an identity other than the root user of the AWS account that owns the bucket, the calling identity must have the DeleteBucketPolicy permissions on the specified bucket and must belong to the bucket owner's account to use this operation.

If you don't have the DeleteBucketPolicy permissions, Amazon S3 returns a `403` Access Denied error. If you have the correct permissions, but you're not using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3 returns a `405 Method Not Allowed` error.

[[DeleteBucketWebsite]]
=== Delete Bucket Website
`<s3:delete-bucket-website>`


Removes the website configuration from a bucket.

Amazon S3 returns a `200 OK` response upon successfully deleting a website configuration from the specified bucket. You receive a `200 OK` response if the website configuration you are trying to delete does not exist on the bucket. Amazon S3 returns a 404 response if the bucket specified in the request does not exist.

This DELETE action requires the S3:DeleteBucketWebsite permission. By default, only the bucket owner can delete the website configuration attached to a bucket. However, bucket owners can grant other users permission to delete the website configuration by writing a bucket policy granting them the S3:DeleteBucketWebsite permission.

[[DeleteObject]]
=== Delete Object
`<s3:delete-object>`


Removes the null version (if there is one) of an object and inserts a delete marker, which becomes the latest version of the object. If there isn't a null version, Amazon S3 does not remove any objects but still responds that the command was successful.

To remove a specific version, you must be the bucket owner and you must use the version ID subresource. Using this subresource permanently deletes the version.

[[DeleteObjects]]
=== Delete Objects
`<s3:delete-objects>`


Enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket using a single HTTP request. If you know the object keys that you want to delete, then this operation provides a suitable alternative to sending individual delete requests, reducing per-request overhead.

The request contains a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete. In the XML, you provide the object key names, and optionally, version IDs if you want to delete a specific version of the object from a versioning-enabled bucket. For each key, Amazon S3 performs a delete action and returns the result of that delete, success, or failure, in the response. If the object specified in the request is not found, Amazon S3 returns the result as deleted.

The action supports two modes for the response: verbose and quiet. By default, the action uses the verbose mode, in which the response includes the result of deletion of each key in your request. In quiet mode, the response includes only keys where the delete action encounters an error. For a successful deletion, the action does not return any information about the delete in the response body.

[[ListMultipartUploads]]
=== List Multipart Uploads
`<s3:list-multipart-uploads>`


This operation lists in-progress multipart uploads. An in-progress multipart upload is a multipart upload that is initiated using the *Initiate Multipart Upload* request, but that has not yet been completed or aborted. In the response, the uploads are sorted by key. If your application has initiated more than one multipart upload using the same object key, then uploads in the response are first sorted by key. Additionally, uploads are sorted in ascending order within each key by the upload initiation time. For information on permissions required to use the multipart upload API, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html[Multipart Upload and Permissions].

[[PutBucketCors]]
=== Put Bucket Cors
`<s3:put-bucket-cors>`


Sets the CORS configuration for your bucket. If the configuration exists, Amazon S3 replaces it.

To use this operation, you need permission to perform the s3:PutBucketCORS action. By default, the bucket owner has this permission and can grant it to others.

You set this configuration on a bucket so that the bucket can service cross-origin requests. For example, you might want to enable a request whose origin is `+http://www.example.com+` to access your Amazon S3 bucket at `+my.example.bucket.com+` by using the browser's XMLHttpRequest capability.

To enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) on a bucket, you add the CORS subresource to the bucket. The CORS subresource is an XML document in which you configure rules that identify origins and the HTTP methods that can be executed on your bucket. The document is limited to 64 KB in size. When Amazon S3 receives a cross-origin request (or a pre-flight OPTIONS request) against a bucket, it evaluates the CORS configuration on the bucket and uses the first CORSRule rule that matches the incoming browser request to enable a cross-origin request. For a rule to match, the following conditions must be met:

* The request's origin header must match the AllowedOrigin elements.
* The request method (for example, GET, PUT, HEAD, and so on) or the Access-Control-Request-Method header for a pre-flight OPTIONS request must be one of the AllowedMethod elements. Every header specified in the Access-Control-Request-Headers request header of a pre-flight request must match an AllowedHeader element.

[[PutBucketLoggingConfiguration]]
=== Put Bucket Logging
`<s3:put-bucket-logging-configuration>`


Set the logging parameters for a bucket and to specify permissions for who can view and modify the logging parameters. All logs are saved to buckets in the same AWS Region as the source bucket. To set the logging status of a bucket, you must be the bucket owner. The bucket owner is automatically granted FULL_CONTROL to all logs. Use the Grantee request element to grant access to other people. The Permissions request element specifies the kind of access the grantee has to the logs.

[[PutBucketNotificationConfiguration]]
=== Put Bucket Notification Configuration
`<s3:put-bucket-notification-configuration>`


Enables notifications of specified events for a bucket. Using this API, you can replace an existing notification configuration. The configuration is an XML file that defines the event types that you want Amazon S3 to publish and the destination where you want Amazon S3 to publish an event notification when it detects an event of the specified type. This operation replaces the existing notification configuration with the configuration you include in the request. You can disable notifications by defining an empty notificationConfiguration. By default, only the bucket owner can configure notifications on a bucket. However, bucket owners can use a bucket policy to grant permission to other users by setting this configuration with an s3:PutBucketNotification permission.

[[PutObject]]
=== Put Object
`<s3:put-object>`


Adds an object to a bucket. You must have WRITE permissions on a bucket to add an object to it. Amazon S3 never adds partial objects; if you receive a success response, Amazon S3 adds the entire object to the bucket.

Amazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it overwrites all but the last object written. Amazon S3 does not provide object locking. If you need object locking, make sure to build it into your application layer or use versioning instead. To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the Content-MD5 parameter. When you use this parameter, Amazon S3 checks the object against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not match, returns an error. Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while putting an object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5 value.

[[RestoreObject]]
=== Restore Object
`<s3:restore-object>`


Restores an archived copy of an object back into Amazon S3. Objects that you archive to the S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, and S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers are not accessible in real time.

For objects in Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers, you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until the object is moved into the Frequent Access tier.

For objects in S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes, you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until a temporary copy of the object is available.

To access an archived object, you must restore the object for the duration (number of days) that you specify.

To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.

[[SelectObjectContent]]
=== Select Object Content
`<s3:select-object-content>`


Filters the contents of an Amazon S3 object based on a simple structured query language (SQL) statement.

In the request, along with the SQL expression, you must also specify a data serialization format (JSON, CSV, or Apache Parquet) of the object. Amazon S3 uses this format to parse object data into records, and returns only records that match the specified SQL expression.

You must also specify the data serialization format for the response. You can use the Amazon S3 Select Object operation to query objects formatted as CSV, JSON, or Parquet files.

This operation supports the following compression types:

* GZIP and BZIP2 for CSV and JSON files

* Columnar compression for Parquet files using GZIP or Snappy

The Amazon S3 *Select Object* operation does not support whole-object compression for Parquet files.

[[UploadPart]]
=== Upload Part
`<s3:upload-part>`


Uploads a part in a multipart upload.

In this operation, you provide part data in your request. However, you have an option to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data source for the part you are uploading.

To upload a part from an existing object, use the <<UploadPartCopy>> operation. You must initiate a multipart upload (refer to <<CreateMultipartUpload>>) before you can upload any part.

In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns an upload ID and an unique identifier that you must include in your upload part request. Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part number uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position within the object created. If you upload a new part using the same part number that is used with a previous part, the previously uploaded part is overwritten. Each part must be at least 5 MB in size, except the last part. There is no size limit on the last part of your multipart upload.

To ensure that data is not corrupted when traversing the network, specify the Content-MD5 header in the upload part request. Amazon S3 checks the part data against the provided MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error.

[NOTE]
After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart upload to stop getting charged for storing the uploaded parts. After you complete or abort the multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees up the parts storage and stops charging you for it.

==== Common Cases for the Operation

* When you upload content of a large file in parts (for example, an FTP Connector *Read* operation or SFTP Connector *On New or Updated File* source of a Mule app), you must configure the *non repeatable stream* strategy in these operations. You must also specify the number of bytes to consume from the content in the *Upload part > Content length* field.
* When you upload the content of many small files, you can configure either the *repeatable stream* or *non repeatable stream* strategy in the FTP or SFTP Connector operations. In the *Upload part* operation, you can optionally specify the entire file size in the *Content length* field.

[[UploadPartCopy]]
=== Upload Part Copy
`<s3:upload-part-copy>`


Uploads a part by copying data from an existing object as data source. The minimum allowable part size for a multipart upload is 5 MB. Instead of using an existing object as part data, you can use the <<UploadPart>> operation and provide data in your request. You must initiate a multipart upload before you can upload a part. Amazon S3 returns a unique identifier, the upload ID, that you must include in your upload part request.

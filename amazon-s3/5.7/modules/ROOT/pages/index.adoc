== About Connectors

Anypoint connectors are Mule runtime engine extensions that enable you to connect to APIs and resources on external systems, such as Salesforce, Amazon S3, ServiceNow, and Twitter.

== Prerequisites

Before creating an app, you must have access to the Amazon S3 target resource, Amazon Web Services, and Anypoint Platform. You must also understand how to create a Mule app using Design Center or Anypoint Studio, and have AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials.

[NOTE]
For the Amazon S3 operations to work, you need to enable or update the subset of the overall list of actions in the Amazon S3 bucket to specify that the AWS account has access these actions.

To see a list of Amazon S3 operations, see the xref:amazon-s3-connector-reference.adoc[Amazon S3 Connector Reference].

== Next Step

After you have met the prerequisites, you are ready to create an app with xref:amazon-s3-connector-design-center.adoc[Design Center] or xref:amazon-s3-connector-studio.adoc[Anypoint Studio].

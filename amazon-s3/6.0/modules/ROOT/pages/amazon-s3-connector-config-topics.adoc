[[prereq]]
== Before You Begin for Source Operations

Amazon S3 source operations use Amazon SQS for notifying when a new object is created or deleted in an S3 bucket.

There are multiple scenarios for the *On New Object* and *On Deleted Object* Amazon S3 sources:

. The <<queue-is-created,queue is already created>> and specified
. The <<queue-created-by-source,queue is created>> by the source
. The <<configuration-is-created, event notification configuration is created>> by the source

[[queue-is-created]]
== Queue Is Already Created

To correctly use a source for a queue that already exists, the user must have these actions enabled for the Amazon SQS queue:

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "sqs:DeleteMessage",
                "sqs:GetQueueUrl",
                "sqs:ReceiveMessage",
                "sqs:GetQueueAttributes"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:QUEUE_NAME"
        }
    ]
}
----

Additionally, to enable the queue to receive messages when a new object is created or deleted in an S3 bucket, create a policy for the queue in this format:

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Id": "arn:aws:sqs:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:QUEUE_NAME/SQSDefaultPolicy",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Sid1593770403887",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "SQS:SendMessage",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:QUEUE_NAME",
      "Condition": {
        "ArnLike": {
          "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

[[queue-created-by-source]]
== Queue Is Created by Source

If the queue is created by the source, the queue name has the prefix `MULE-S3-TRIGGER`.

When the queue is created by the source, the user must have permission to both create a queue and set the queue attributes:

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "sqs:DeleteMessage",
                "sqs:ReceiveMessage",
                "sqs:GetQueueAttributes",
                "sqs:CreateQueue",
                "sqs:SetQueueAttributes",
                "sqs:GetQueueUrl"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:MULE-S3-TRIGGER-*"
        }
    ]
}
----

When the queue is created by the source, an SQS policy is added to the queue in the following format when the S3 object is created or deleted in the bucket :


[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Id": "example-ID",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "example-statement-ID",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "*"
    },
      "Action": "SQS:SendMessage",
      "Resource":QUEUE_ARN,
      "Condition": {
        "ArnLike": {
          "aws:SourceArn": "BUCKET_ARN"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

[[configuration-is-created]]
== Notification Configuration for S3 Bucket Events is Already Created

To correctly use a source for a notification configuration that already exists, you must specify the notification configuration name in the ADVANCED tab of the source:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
   <s3:new-object-trigger doc:name="On New Object" config-ref="${config}" bucketName="example-bucket-name"
                               notificationConfigurationName="on-new-object-configuration">
            <scheduling-strategy>
                <fixed-frequency/>
            </scheduling-strategy>
        </s3:new-object-trigger>
----

== S3 Policy Bucket

For the S3 policy, use this format for all cases:

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "Policy1593761427184",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1593760119344",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:user/test"
            },
            "Action": "SPECIFIC_ACTION",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME/*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1593760259223",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:user/test"
            },
            "Action": ["s3:PutBucketNotification", "s3:GetBucketNotification"],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME"
        }
    ]
}
----

In this example, the *SPECIFIC_ACTION* is `s3:PutObject` or `s3:DeleteObject`, depending on the specified source operation.

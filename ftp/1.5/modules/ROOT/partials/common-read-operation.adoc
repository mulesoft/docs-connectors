== MIME Types and Encoding

Each connector tries to determine a file’s MIME type from its extension. You can force the MIME type to a different value with the *MIME Type* (`outputMimeType`) parameter.

The same process works for encoding. By default, the connector assumes that the default encoding in the Mule runtime matches the MIME type of the file, however, you can set the encoding through the *Encoding* (`outputEncoding`) parameter.

== Why MIME Types Matter

DataWeave expressions are embeddable inside operations that generate payloads and other values. Having the correct MIME type set helps DataWeave auto-assign types and also generate the correct outputs. Also, maximizing the use of DataSense’s functionality improves the user experience.

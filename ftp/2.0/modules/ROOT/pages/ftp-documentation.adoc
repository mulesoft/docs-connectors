[[copy]]
=== Copy
`<ftp:copy>`

Copies the file or directory specified in *Source Path* into the *Target Path*. The source path can be either a file or a directory. If it points to a directory, then it is copied recursively.

If the target path doesn't exist, and neither does its parent, then a parent folder is created if *Create parent directories* is set to `true`. If *Create parent directories* is set to `false`, then an `FTP:ILLEGAL_PATH` error is thrown.

If *Overwrite* is set to `true` and the target file already exists, then the target file is overwritten. Otherwise, an `FTP:FILE_ALREADY_EXISTS` error is thrown.

[[read]]
=== Read
`<ftp:read>`

Obtains the content and metadata of a file at a specified path. The operation itself returns a Message with a payload that is an input stream with the file's content, and the metadata is represented as an `FtpFileAttributes` object that's placed as the message's `Message#getAttributes()` attributes.

If the lock parameter is set to `true`, then a file system-level lock is placed on the file until the input stream this operation returns is closed or fully consumed. Because the lock is actually provided by the host file system, its behavior might change depending on the mounted drive and the operation system on which Mule is running. Take that into consideration before relying on this lock.

This method also makes a best effort to determine the MIME type of the file being read by using the file’s extension to make an educated guess. You can also use the output *Encoding* and output *MIME Type* optional parameters to force the encoding and MIME type.

[[write]]
=== Write
`<ftp:write>`

Writes the content into the file the path points to.

If the directory to which the file is attempting to be written doesn’t exist, then the operation will either throw an FTP:ILLEGAL_PATH error, or create a new folder, depending on the value of *Create parent directories*. If the file already exists, then the behavior depends on the supplied mode.

This operation also supports locking depending on the value of the lock argument, and follows the same rules and considerations as described in the read operation.

== Sources

[[listener]]
=== On New or Updated File
`<ftp:listener>`

Polls a directory and looks for files that have been created in it. One message is generated for each file that is found.

The key part of this functionality is how to determine that a file is actually new. There are three strategies for that:

* Set the *Auto delete* parameter to `true` to delete each file after it is processed, which causes all files obtained in the next poll to be necessarily new.
* Set the *Move to directory* parameter to move each file to a different directory after it is processed, which achieves the same effect as *Auto delete* but without losing the file.
* Use *Watermark enabled* to pick only files that have been created or updated after the last poll was executed.

You can also use a matcher for additional filtering of files.

==== Parameters
[%header,cols="20s,20a,35a,20a,5a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Configuration | String | The name of the configuration to use. | | x
| Directory a| String |  The directory that contains polled files. |  |
| Recursive a| Boolean |  Whether or not to also poll files contained in subdirectories. |  `true` |
| Matcher a| <<matcher>> |  A matcher used to filter events on files that do not meet the matcher's criteria. |  |
| Watermark Enabled a| Boolean |  Controls whether or not to do watermarking, and if so, if the watermark should consider the file's modification or creation timestamps. |  `false` |
| Time Between Size Check a| Number |  Wait time (in milliseconds) between size checks to determine if a file is ready to be read. This allows a file write to complete before processing. You can disable this feature by omitting a value. When enabled, Mule performs two size checks, waiting the specified time between calls. If both checks return the same value, the file is ready to be read. |  |
| Time Between Size Check Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  A *Time unit* that qualifies the *Time between size check* attribute. |  |
| Output Mime Type a| String |  The MIME type of the payload that this operation outputs. |  |

| Redelivery Policy a| <<RedeliveryPolicy>> |  Defines a policy for processing the redelivery of the same message. |  |
| Reconnection Strategy a| * <<reconnect>>
* <<reconnect-forever>> |  A retry strategy in case of connectivity errors. |  |
| Auto Delete a| Boolean |  Whether or not each file should be deleted after processing. |  `false` |
| Move To Directory a| String |  If provided, each processed file will be moved to a directory pointed to by this path. |  |
| Rename To a| String |  This parameter works in tandem with *Move to directory*. Use this parameter to enter the name under which the file should be moved. Do not set this parameter if *Move to directory* hasn't been set as well. |  |
| Apply Post Action When Failed a| Boolean |  Whether any of the post actions (autoDelete and moveToDirectory) should also be applied in case the file failed to be processed. If set to `false`, no failed files will be moved or deleted. |  `true` |
| Overwrite a| Boolean | Enables you to overwrite the target file when the destination file has the same name. | `false`|

[[PoolingProfile]]
=== Pooling Profile 

The natural behavior of the connection pooling mechanism is to avoid creating connections all the time. The mechanism does not actually close managed connections; instead, the pool retrieves released connections and keeps them active for reuse when a user needs them.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Active a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can be borrowed from a session at one time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of components that can be active at one time. When maxActive is exceeded, the pool is said to be exhausted. |  |
| Max Idle a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can sit idle in the pool at any time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of Mule components that can be idle at one time. |  |
| Max Wait a| Number | Specifies the number of milliseconds to wait for a pooled component to become available when the pool is exhausted and the *Exhausted action* is set to `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT`. |  |
| Min Eviction Millis a| Number | Determines the minimum amount of time an object can sit idle in the pool before it is eligible for eviction. When non-positive, no objects will be evicted from the pool due to idle time alone. |  |
| Eviction Check Interval Millis a| Number | Specifies the number of milliseconds between runs of the object evictor. When non-positive, no object evictor is executed. |  |
| Exhausted Action a| Enumeration, one of:

** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW
** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT
** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL a| Specifies the behavior of the Mule component pool when the pool is exhausted. Possible values are:

* WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL +
Throws a `NoSuchElementException`.
* WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT +
Blocks by invoking `Object.wait(long)` until a new or idle object is available.
* WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW +
Creates a new Mule instance and returns it, essentially making *Max active* meaningless.

If a positive *Max wait* value is supplied, it will block for that many milliseconds at most, after which a `NoSuchElementException` will be thrown. If maxThreadWait is a negative value, it will block indefinitely. |  |
| Initialisation Policy a| Enumeration, one of:

** INITIALISE_NONE
** INITIALISE_ONE
** INITIALISE_ALL a| Determines how components in a pool should be initialized. The possible values are:

* INITIALISE_NONE +
Will not load any components into the pool on startup.

| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | The amount of instances that is initially be allowed to be kept in memory to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can fit into this buffer, then the buffer expands according to the *Buffer size increment* attribute, with an upper limit of maxInMemorySize. Default value is 100 instances. | 100  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This is by how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer should not expand, meaning that a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error is raised when the buffer gets full. Default value is 100 instances. | 100  |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | The maximum amount of memory to use. If more than that is used then a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error is raised. A value lower than, or equal to, zero means no limit. |  |

= Copy and Move Files with the FTP Connector Example - Mule 4

Anypoint Connector for FTP (FTP Connector) provides *Copy* and *Move* operations that enable you to copy and move files or directories on demand.

While SFTP has a native concept of copying and moving, FTP does not. FTP Connector simulates these operations by downloading file content and writing it to a new location, using concurrent streams that start writing and reading at the same time. Because these operations create significant network overhead, use them wisely.

== Configure the Copy Operation in Studio

To add and configure the *Copy* operation in Studio, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, search for `ftp` and select the *Copy* operation.
. Drag the *Copy* operation onto the Studio canvas.
. In the *General* tab of the operation configuration screen, click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to access the global element configuration fields.
. Specify the connection information and click *OK*.
. Set *Source path* to the path of the file to copy, for example, `source.txt`.
. Set *Target path* to the directory path into which to copy the file, for example, `backup`.
. Set *Rename to* to rename the file as part of the operation, for example, `renamed.txt`. +
This field must be a filename, not a path. If this attribute is not provided, the original filename is used.

In the Configuration XML editor, the `<ftp:copy>` configuration looks like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<ftp:copy sourcePath="source.txt" targetPath="backup"
  overwrite="true|false" createParentDirectories="true|false"
  renameTo="renamed.txt"/>

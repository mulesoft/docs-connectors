= Read a File Using the FTP Connector Example - Mule 4

Anypoint Connector for FTP (FTP Connector) provides a *Read* operation that reads a file at any point in the flow. The operation reads the file in the given path and returns a Mule message with the following attributes:

* The file's content as the payload
* The file's metadata in the message attributes
* If the file does not exist, you receive an `FTP:ILLEGAL_PATH` error
+
Note that the operation does not read directories.
When the file is read from the FTP source folder, the file remains in the same folder until it is manually deleted.

The *Read* operation makes use of the repeatable streams functionality. The operation returns a list of messages, where each message represents a file in the list and holds a stream to the file. A stream is repeatable by default.

For more information about repeatable streams, refer to the xref:mule-runtime::streaming-about.adoc[streaming in Mule 4] documentation.

== Configure the Read Operation in Studio

To add and configure the *Read* operation in Studio, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, search for `ftp` and select the *Read* operation.
. Drag the *Read* operation onto the Studio canvas.
. In the *General* tab of the operation configuration screen, click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to access the global element configuration fields.
. Specify the connection information and click *OK*.
. In the *General* tab, set *File Path* to the path of the file to read, for example, `#[path]`.
. In the *MIME Type* tab, set *MIME Type* to `application/xml` and set *Encoding* to `ISO 10646/Unicode(UTF-8)`.

In the *Configuration XML* editor, the `<ftp:read>` configuration looks like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<ftp:read path="#[path]"
  lock="true|false"
  outputEncoding="UTF-8"
  outputMimeType="application/xml" />
----


// == INCLUDE SHARED READ OP CONTENT FOR FILE, FTP, AND SFTP CONNECTORS
include::partial$common-read-operation.adoc[]

// == File Locking SHARED BY FTP AND SFTP only
include::partial$common-file-lock.adoc[]

[NOTE]
If the file is already locked by someone else, the connector cannot unlock it, resulting in a `FTP:FILE_LOCK` error.

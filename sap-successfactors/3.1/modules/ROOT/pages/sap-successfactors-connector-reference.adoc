[[config]]
== Default Configuration

=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | |x
| Connection a| <<config_basic, Basic Authentication>>
 | The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | |x
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform expires the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime only purges instances as needed. |  |
|===

[[config_basic]]
== Basic Authentication Connection Type

=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Proxy Configuration a| One of:

* <<Default>>
* <<NTLM>> |  |  |
| Data Center's EndPoint URL a| String |  Data Center's EndPoint URL |  |x
| Use Persistent Connections a| Boolean |  If false, each connection will be closed after the first request is completed. |  true |
| Max Connections a| Number |  The maximum number of outbound connections to keep open at the same time. By default the number of connections is unlimited. |  -1 |
| Connection Idle Timeout a| Number |  The number of milliseconds that a connection can remain idle before it is closed. The value of this attribute is only used when persistent connections are enabled. |  30000 |
| Stream Response a| Boolean |  Whether or not received responses should be streamed, meaning processing will continue as soon as all headers are parsed and the body streamed as it arrives. When enabled, the response MUST be eventually read since depending on the configured buffer size it may not fit into memory and processing stops until space is available. |  false |
| Response Buffer Size a| Number |  The space in bytes for the buffer where the HTTP response is stored. |  -1 |
| Connection Timeout a| Number |  |  30000 |
| Company ID a| String |  The Company ID |  |x
| User Name a| String |  The user name |  |x
| Password a| String |  The password |  |x
| Enable Session Reuse a| Boolean |  Boolean to enable Session Reuse feature. By default, it is false. |  false |
| TLS Configuration a| <<TLS>> |  Protocol to use for communication. Valid values are HTTP and HTTPS. Default value is HTTP. When using HTTPS the HTTP communication is going to be secured using TLS / SSL. If HTTPS was configured as protocol then the user needs to configure at least the keystore in the tls:context child element of this listener-config. |  |
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to true, deployment fails if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy |  |

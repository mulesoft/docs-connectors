Release Notes: xref:release-notes::connector/sap-successfactors-connector-release-notes-mule-4.adoc[SAP SuccessFactors Connector Release Notes]

[[config]]
== Default Configuration

=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | |x
| Connection a| <<config_basic, Basic Authentication>>
 | The connection types to provide to this configuration. | |x
| Time Zone a| String |  Date objects returned from SuccessFactors are converted to the specified timezone. |  `UTC` | 
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before Mule considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the instance expires at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. Mule purges the instances as appropriate. |  |
|===

[[config_basic]]
== Basic Authentication Connection Type

=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Proxy Configuration a| One of:

* <<Default>>
* <<NTLM>> |  |  |
| Data Center's EndPoint URL a| String |  Data Center's EndPoint URL |  |x
| Use Persistent Connections a| Boolean |  If `false`, each connection is closed after the first request is completed. |  `true` |
| Max Connections a| Number |  The maximum number of outbound connections to keep open concurrently. By default, the number of connections is unlimited. |  `-1` |
| Connection Idle Timeout a| Number |  The number of milliseconds that a connection can remain idle before it is closed. The value of this attribute is used only when persistent connections are enabled. |  `30000` |
| Stream Response a| Boolean |  Whether or not to stream received responses, meaning processing continues as soon as all headers are parsed and the body is streamed as it arrives. When enabled, the response must eventually be read since, depending on the configured buffer size, it might not fit into memory and processing stops until space is available. |  `false` |
| Response Buffer Size a| Number | The space in bytes for the buffer where the HTTP response is stored. |  `-1` |
| Connection Timeout a| Number |  |  `30000` |
| Company ID a| String |  The Company ID |  |x
| User Name a| String |  The user name |  |x
| Password a| String |  The password |  |x
| Enable Session Reuse a| Boolean |  Boolean to enable the *Session Reuse* feature. By default, it is false. |  `false` |
| TLS Configuration a| <<TLS>> |  Defines a configuration for TLS, which can be used from both the client and server sides to secure communication for the Mule app. When using the HTTPS protocol, the HTTP communication is secured using TLS or SSL. If HTTPS is configured as the protocol then the user needs to configure at least the keystore in the `tls:context` child element of the `listener-config`. |  |
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to `true`, deployment fails if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy. |  |

[[config]]
== Default Configuration

=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | *x*

|===

[[config_basic]]
== Basic Authentication

=== Note

Mule 4.2.0 and later is required for Basic authentication.

=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Proxy Configuration a| One of:

* <<Default>>
* <<NTLM>> |  |  |
| Data Center's EndPoint URL a| String |  Data Center's EndPoint URL. |  |x
| Use Persistent Connections a| Boolean |  If `false`, each connection is closed after the first request completes. |  `true` |
| Max Connections a| Number |  The maximum number of outbound connections to keep open concurrently. By default, the number of connections is unlimited. |  `-1` |
| Connection Idle Timeout a| Number |  The number of milliseconds that a connection can remain idle before it is closed. The value of this attribute is used only when persistent connections are enabled. |  `30000` |

** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Connection idle timeout unit for the request | `SECONDS` |
| Stream Response a| Boolean |  Whether or not to stream received responses, which means that processing continues as soon as all headers are parsed and the body is streamed as it is received. When enabled, the response must eventually be read since, depending on the configured buffer size, the response might not fit into memory and processing stops until space is available. |  `false` |
| Response Buffer Size a| Number | The space in bytes for the buffer where the HTTP response is stored. |  `-1` |
| Connection timeout a| Number |  Connection timeout for the request |  `30` |
| Connection Timeout Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

== Changes in This Release

SuccessFactors Connector 4.0 has added support for OAuth 2.0 SAML Bearer Assertion authentication.

== Requirements

To take advantage of the security offered by using OAuth 2.0 SAML Bearer Assertion for authentication, you must configure you SuccessFactors account and instance with an application that can connect using OAuth.

== Use the SAP SuccessFactors OData API to Generate Access Tokens

SAP SuccessFactors OData API supports two-legged authentication for OAuth 2.0. You can use the OData APIs to generate access tokens for OAuth 2.0 authentication:

. Use `/oauth/idp` to pass a private key to generate a signed SAML assertion.
. Use `/oauth/token` to pass a token for signing in a SAML assertion.
. Use `/odata/v2` to use the access token for authentication and access the OData APIs. 
. Use `/oauth/validate` to pass the access token to the API and verify that it’s still valid. +
A token is only valid for 24 hours after it’s generated. 

== Upgrade Prerequisites

Before you perform the upgrade, you must create a backup of your files, data, and configurations in case you need to restore to them.

== Upgrade Steps

Follow these steps to perform the upgrade:

. In Anypoint Studio, create a Mule project.
. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Dependencies to Project*, enter `successfactors` in the search field.
. In *Available modules*, select *SuccessFactors* and click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.
. Verify that the SAP SuccessFactors Connector dependency version is `4.0.0` in the `pom.xml` file in the Mule project.

Studio upgrades the connector automatically.

=== Verify the Upgrade

After you install the latest version of the connector, follow these steps to verify the upgrade:

. In Studio, verify that there are no errors in the *Problems* or *Console* views.
. Verify that there are no problems in the project `pom.xml` file.
. Test the connection to verify that the operations work.

== Troubleshoot

If there are problems with caching the parameters and caching the metadata, try restarting Anypoint Studio.

=== Revert the Upgrade

If it is necessary to revert to the previous version of SAP SuccessFactors Connector, change the `sap-successfactors-connector` dependency version `4.0.0` in the project's `pom.xml` to the previous version.

You must update the project's `pom.xml` in Anypoint Studio.

= HTTP Connector
:keywords: anypoint studio, esb, connectors, http, https, http headers, query parameters, rest, raml
:page-aliases: 3.8@mule-runtime::http-connector.adoc

The HTTP connector sends and receives HTTP or HTTPS requests using a host, port, and address. Find the two important use cases for this component below.

Depending on your needs, you can either:

* Use the connector as an xref:http-listener-connector.adoc[HTTP Listener Connector] for requests that arrive at a certain address, subsequently generating an HTTP response
* Use the connector as an xref:http-request-connector.adoc[HTTP Request Connector] to send requests to a certain address and receive the returned response

Through additional configuration, the connector allows you to:

* Use xref:tls-configuration.adoc[TLS] encryption to send or receive HTTPS requests.
* Send xref:authentication-in-http-requests.adoc[Authenticated Requests] using Basic Authentication, Digest, or OAuth.

[NOTE]
====
In Mule 3.6 and later versions, the HTTP and HTTPS endpoint-based connectors and transports have been replaced by a single HTTP operation-based connector which supports HTTPS.

== Using HTTP Connectors

The HTTP connector can work in one of two ways, depending on where it is placed in a flow:

* As an xref:http-listener-connector.adoc[HTTP Listener]
* As an xref:http-request-connector.adoc[HTTP Request]

== Quick References

Use the HTTP Listener or HTTP Request quick reference for your editing environment: Studio or XML Editor.

=== HTTP Listener Quick Reference for Studio

To instantiate the connector as an HTTP listener, place it onto a blank Anypoint Studio canvas into the *Source* section of a new flow (the first element in the flow):

.New Flow Showing Source and Process Phases

.Drag the HTTP Connector to the Source Side

.See the Connector Populate the Source Side

=== HTTP Request Quick Reference for Studio

To instantiate the connector as an HTTP request connector, you must place it into the *Process* section of a flow (anywhere except the first element in the flow).

.Drag the HTTP Connector to the Process Side

=== HTTP Listener Quick Reference for XML Editor

To instantiate the connector as an HTTP Listener Connector, add the following XML tag at the start of a flow:

[source,xml]
----
<http:listener config-ref="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" path="/" />
----

This element must reference a global configuration element of the following type:

[source,xml]
----
<http:listener-config name="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" host="localhost" port="8081" />
----

=== HTTP Request Quick Reference for XML Editor

To instantiate the connector as an HTTP Request Connector, add the following XML tag in any part of a flow:

[source,xml]
----
<http:request config-ref="HTTP_Request_Configuration" path="/" method="GET" />
----

This element must reference a global configuration element of the following type:

[source,xml]
----
<http:request-config name="HTTP_Request_Configuration" host="example.com" port="8081"/>
----

[TIP]
* To migrate a project that uses the old xref:3.8@mule-runtime::deprecated-http-transport-reference.adoc[HTTP endpoint-based connector] to the new HTTP operation-based connector, see xref:migrating-to-the-new-http-connector.adoc[Migrating to the New HTTP Connector]. The old HTTP endpoint-based connector still works with Mule runtime 3.6, but it's deprecated and will eventually be removed.
* You can edit the log4j2 configuration file to make the logging of the HTTP connector's activity a lot more verbose, if you need to. See xref:3.8@mule-runtime::logging-in-mule.adoc[Logging in Mule] for instructions.

== Debugging with Mule Logs

Gaining visibility into HTTP inbound and outbound behavior can be achieved by enabling underlying library loggers with `log4j2`.
If you have never adjusted Mule logging levels in the past, read xref:3.8@mule-runtime::logging-in-mule.adoc#configuring-custom-logging-settings[configuring custom logging settings] before continuing.

== Logging Listener and Request Activity

When you select the `DEBUG` level on `org.mule.module.http.internal.HttpMessageLogger`,
activity coming from all HTTP Listeners and HTTP Requests is logged.
This includes the HTTP Listener's inbound request, HTTP Request's outbound request, and each response body.

== HTTP Listener Log Output

The log output of the HTTP Listener displays the metadata of the inbound request.

[source,console]
----
DEBUG 2016-02-10 10:55:03,234 [[hello].HTTP_Listener_Configuration.worker.01] org.mule.module.http.internal.HttpMessageLogger: LISTENER
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8081
User-Agent: curl/7.43.0
Accept: */*
----

The log output also displays information about the response being sent back.

[source,console]
----
LISTENER
HTTP/1.1 200
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
Date: Wed, 10 Feb 2016 18:55:03 GMT

2000
{
  "message" : "hello, world"
}
----

[TIP]
Chunked encoding produces a separate log record for each chunk.

== HTTP Request Log Output

The log output of the HTTP Request displays metadata of the outbound request.

[source,console]
----
DEBUG 2016-02-10 11:29:18,647 [[hello].http.requester.HTTP_Request_Configuration(1) SelectorRunner] org.mule.module.http.internal.HttpMessageLogger: REQUESTER
GET /v3/hello HTTP/1.1
Host: mocker-server.cloudhub.io:80
User-Agent: AHC/1.0
Connection: keep-alive
Accept: */*
----

The log output also displays information about the response sent back from the target.

[source,console]
----
DEBUG 2016-02-10 11:29:18,729 [[hello].http.requester.HTTP_Request_Configuration.worker(1)] org.mule.module.http.internal.HttpMessageLogger: REQUESTER
HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Wed, 10 Feb 2016 19:29:18 GMT
Server: nginx
Content-Length: 10940
Connection: keep-alive

{
  "message" : "Hello, world"
}
----

== Logging Packet Metadata

If you wish to log the actual request and response packets transmitted over HTTP, enable the `DEBUG` level on `com.ning.http.client.providers.grizzly`.
Once set, the log reports metadata of the request packets from `AsyncHTTPClientFilter` and the response packets from `AhcEventFilter`. Unlike the `HttpMessageLogger`, this setting does not log request or response bodies.

== Request Packet Log Output

Example of the log output of the request packet's metadata:

[source,console]
----
DEBUG 2016-02-10 11:16:29,421 [[hello].http.requester.HTTP_Request_Configuration(1) SelectorRunner] com.ning.http.client.providers.grizzly.AsyncHttpClientFilter: REQUEST: HttpRequestPacket (
   method=GET
   url=/v3/hello
   query=null
   protocol=HTTP/1.1
   content-length=-1
   headers=[
      Host=mocker-server.cloudhub.io:80
      User-Agent=AHC/1.0
      Connection=keep-alive
      Accept=*/*]
)
----

== Response Packet Log Output

Example of the log output of the response packet's metadata:

[source,console]
----
DEBUG 2016-02-10 11:16:29,508 [[hello].http.requester.HTTP_Request_Configuration.worker(1)] com.ning.http.client.providers.grizzly.AhcEventFilter: RESPONSE: HttpResponsePacket (
  status=200
  reason=
  protocol=HTTP/1.1
  content-length=10940
  committed=false
  headers=[
      content-type=application/json
      date=Wed, 10 Feb 2016 19:16:29 GMT
      server=nginx
      content-length=10940
      connection=keep-alive]
)
----

== Non-blocking Processing

The HTTP Connector (both the HTTP Listener and the HTTP Request connector) can be used with a non-blocking processing strategy.
With this strategy, while a message is waiting for a response from an external source, the message processor is still free to process other messages that arrive.

[NOTE]
Note that xref:3.8@mule-runtime::flow-processing-strategies.adoc#supported-non-blocking-components[not all Mule components] currently support the non-blocking processing strategy.
If there are any unsupported components in a flow, they cause the flow to fall back to synchronous processing.

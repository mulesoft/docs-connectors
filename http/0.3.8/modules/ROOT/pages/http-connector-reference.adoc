== Listener

Listener for incoming HTTP requests.

=== Attributes of listener

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|Name |Description
|path |Path to listen for incoming requests. +
Type: string +
Required: yes +
Default: none
|allowedMethods |Comma separated list of allowed HTTP methods by this listener. To allow all methods, do not define the attribute. +
Type: string +
Required: no +
Default: none
|config-ref |A reference to the configuration element for this listener. If no reference is provided, a default configuration is created. +
Type: string +
Required: yes +
Default: none
|responseStreamingMode |Defines if the response should be sent using streaming or not. If this attribute is not present, the behavior depends on the type of the payload (it streams only for InputStream). If set to true, it always streams. If set to false, it never streams. As streaming is done, the response is sent to the user. +
Transfer-Encoding: chunked. +
Type: enumeration +
Required: no +
Default: AUTO
|parseRequest |By default, the request is parsed (for example, a multi-part request is mapped as a Mule message with null payload and inbound attachments with each part). If this property is set to false, no parsing is done, and the payload always contains the raw contents of the HTTP request. +
Type: string +
Required: no +
Default: none
|===

=== Child Elements of listener

[%header,cols="30a,10a,60a"]

Default: none
|parseRequest |By default, the request is parsed (for example, a multi part request is mapped as a Mule message with null payload and inbound attachments with each part). If this property is set to false, no parsing is done, and the payload always contains the raw contents of the HTTP request. +
Type: string +
Required: no +
Default: none
|connectionIdleTimeout |The number of milliseconds that a connection can remain idle before it is closed. The value of this attribute is only used when persistent connections are enabled.

HTTP Connector v1.5

Use Anypoint Connector for HTTP (HTTP Connector) to handle and perform HTTP requests. This class
only serves as an extension definition. This
connector's configurations are divided between a server (`<http:listener-config>`) and a client (`<http:requester-config>`). capabilities.

Release Notes: xref:release-notes::connector/connector-http.adoc[HTTP Connector Release Notes]

| Protocol a| Enumeration, one of:

** HTTP
** HTTPS |  Protocol to use for communication. Valid values are HTTP and HTTPS. Default value is HTTP. When using HTTPS the HTTP communication is going to be secured using TLS / SSL.

[[requestConfig]]
=== Request Configuration


Configuration element for a HTTP requests.


==== Parameters
[%header,cols="20s,20a,35a,20a,5a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | |x
| Connection a| <<requestConfig_request, Request>>
 | The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | |x
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform will expire the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime will actually purge the instances when it sees it fit. |  |
| Base Path a| String |  Base path to use for all requests that reference this config. |  / |
| Follow Redirects a| Boolean |  Specifies whether to follow redirects or not. Default value is true. |  true |
| Send Body Mode a| Enumeration, one of:

** ALWAYS
** AUTO
** NEVER |  Defines if the request should contain a body or not. If AUTO, it will depend on the method (GET, HEAD and OPTIONS will not send a body). |  AUTO |
| Request Streaming Mode a| Enumeration, one of:

** AUTO
** ALWAYS
** NEVER |  Defines if the request should be sent using streaming or not. If this attribute is not present, the behavior will depend on the type of the payload (it will stream only for InputStream). If set to true, it will always stream. If set to false, it will never stream. As streaming is done the request will be sent user Transfer-Encoding: chunked. |  AUTO |
| Enable Cookies a| Boolean |  If true, cookies received in HTTP responses will be stored, and sent in subsequent HTTP requests. |  true |
| Default Headers a| Array of <<defaultHeader>> |  Default HTTP headers the message should include. |  |
| Query Parameters a| Array of <<QueryParam>> |  Default Query parameters the request should include. |  |
| Send Correlation Id a| Enumeration, one of:

** AUTO
** ALWAYS
** NEVER |  Whether to specify a correlation id when publishing messages. This applies both for custom correlation ids specified at the operation level and for default correlation ids taken from the current event. |  AUTO |
| Preserve Headers Case a| Boolean |  By default, header keys are stored internally in lower-case. This is to improve performance of headers handling and is functionally correct as specified in the RFC. <p> In the case a server expects headers in a specific case, this flag may be set to true so the case of the header keys are preserved. |  false |
| Response Timeout a| Number |  Maximum time in milliseconds that the request element blocks the execution of the flow waiting for the HTTP response. If this value is not present, the connector uses the default response timeout from the Mule configuration, which is also 10000 | 10000 |
| Response Validator a| One of:

* <<SuccessStatusCodeValidator>>
* <<FailureStatusCodeValidator>> |  Configures a default error handling of the response. |  |
|===

==== Connection Types
[[requestConfig_request]]
===== Request


Connection provider for a HTTP request, handles the creation of HttpExtensionClient instances.


====== Parameters
[%header,cols="20s,20a,35a,20a,5a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Proxy Config a| One of:

| TLS Configuration a| <<Tls>> |  Reference to a TLS config element. This will enable HTTPS for this config. |  |
| Protocol a| Enumeration, one of:

** HTTP
** HTTPS |  Protocol to use for communication. Valid values are HTTP and HTTPS. Default value is HTTP. When using HTTPS the HTTP communication is going to be secured using TLS/SSL. If HTTPS was configured as protocol, then the user can customize the TLS/SSL configuration by defining the `tls:context` child element of this listener-config. If not `tls:context` is defined, then the default JVM certificates are used to establish communication. |  HTTP |
| Host a| String |  Host where the requests will be sent. |  |

| Max Connections a| Number |  The maximum number of outbound connections that will be kept open at the same time. By default the number of connections is unlimited. |  -1 |
| Connection Idle Timeout a| Number |  The number of milliseconds that a connection can remain idle before it is closed. The value of this attribute is only used when persistent connections are enabled. |  30000 |
| Stream Response a| Boolean |  Whether or not received responses should be streamed, meaning processing will continue as soon as all headers are parsed and the body streamed as it arrives. When enabled, the response MUST be eventually read since depending on the configured buffer size it may not fit into memory and processing will stop until space is available. |  false |
| Response Buffer Size a| Number |  The space in bytes for the buffer where the HTTP response will be stored. |  -1 |
| Client Socket Properties a| <<TcpClientSocketProperties>> |  |  |
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to true, deployment will fail if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy |  |

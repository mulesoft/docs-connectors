= Post a Form Example - Mule 4
:page-aliases: connectors::http/http-post-form-task.adoc

The following examples shows how to configure Anypoint Connector for HTTP (HTTP Connector) *Listener* source to post a form by sending HTTP requests, which contains form parameters.
To accomplish this example, you must create the Mule app, configure an HTTP global element, run the app, and post the form using curl commands.

The following screenshot shows the Anypoint Studio app flow for this example:

== Create the Mule Application

To create the Mule flow:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select the HTTP *Listener* source and drag it on to the canvas. +
The source initiates the flow by listening for incoming HTTP message attributes.
. Set the *Path* field to `submitform`.
. Click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of the HTTP *Listener* in the app.
. On the *General* tab, configure the following fields:
+
* *Host*: `localhost`
* *Port*: `8081`
+
[start=5]
. Click *OK*.
. Drag a *Choice* router component to the right of the HTTP *Listener* source. +
The *Choice* router adds conditional processing to the flow.
. Drag a *Set Payload* component into the *When* condition box of the *Choice* router.
. Set the *Value* field to `Sorry #[payload.'firstname'], you're too young to register.` +
Note that this expression refers to one of the form parameters included in the request: `firstname`. After the connector receives the parameter, it exists in the Mule Message payload as an item in a map.
. On the *Choice* router, select the *When* condition.
. Set the *Expression* field to `#[server.dateTime.year-18 < payload.'yearborn']` +
This expression refers to one of the incoming form parameters, `yearborn`.
. Drag another *Set Payload* component into the *Default* condition box of the *Choice* router.
. Set the *Value* field to `Registration has been carried out successfully! Welcome #[payload.'firstname'] #[payload.'lastname']!`
. Save your Mule app.
. Click the project name in *Package Explorer* and then click *Run* > *Run As* > *Mule Application*.
. To post the form, try the following curl command http://localhost:8081/submitform.

The post body contains the following form parameters: `firstname`, `lastname` and `yearborn`:

[source,text,linenums]
----
POST /submitform HTTP/1.1

User-Agent: Mule/3.6
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 32

firstname=Aaron&lastname=Aguilar+Acevedo&yearborn=1999
----

When the HTTP Listener receives the request, it creates a Mule Message that contains a map type payload with the following key-value pairs:

`firstname: Aaron` +
`lastname: Aguilar Acevedo` +
`yearborn: 1999`

Note that in the case of the `lastname` parameter, while the value is encoded in the HTTP request (`Aguilar+Acevedo)`, the connector automatically decodes the value for you when placing it in the Mule Message.

On any of the remaining blocks on the flow, you can easily access the value of the elements in the Map payload by using MEL expressions to refer to their corresponding keys.

In the previous example, the value matching the `yearborn` key is obtained via the expression `#[payload.'yearborn']`. Depending on the value of this expression, one of two different paths is followed:

* The first path sets the payload to a message that rejects the registration, referencing the value matching the `firstname` key through a similar MEL expression.
* The second path accepts the registration and welcomes the user by name, referencing the `firstname` and `lastname` values.

== XML for Posting a Form App

Paste this code into your Studio XML editor to quickly load the flow for this example into your Mule app:

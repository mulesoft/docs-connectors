= Authentication in HTTP Requests
:keywords: http, authentication, security, users, connectors, anypoint, studio, oauth, basic auth, digest
:page-aliases: 3.9@mule-runtime::authentication-in-http-requests.adoc

Use the authentication that you configure in HTTP requests when your Mule app is sending requests to a service that requires authentication, such as the Github OAuth2 server described in <<OAuth2 - Authorization Code>>. In this case, your Mule app is the client. On the other hand, when you want to protect your API or app from _receiving requests_ from unauthorized access, use an API Manager policy, such as the xref:api-manager::external-oauth-2.0-token-validation-policy.adoc[OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider] policy.

The HTTP request connector supports connecting a Mule client app to a service that requires any of the following types of authentication:

* <<Basic Authentication>>
* <<NTLM Authentication>>
* <<Digest Authentication>>
* <<OAuth2 - Authorization Code>>
* <<OAuth2 - Client Credentials>>

If the target HTTP service of your request requires that you authenticate, provide the necessary credentials in the global HTTP Request Configuration element. Mule uses the credentials you configure in the authorization header of the request.

You can also configure Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt the OAuth credentials.

== Basic Authentication

This example builds and runs an app in Studio that sends a request to the https://developer.github.com/v3[Github API] for user information. The Github API accepts requests for user information on port 443 to https://api.github.com/user.

To comply with the basic authentication requirements, the app provides the Github user name and password. You configure the HTTP Request Connector to provide these credentials.

This example requires that you have a Github account.

*To call the Github API, first set up an HTTP listen connector:*

== NTLM Authentication

NT LAN Manager (NTLM) authentication replaces the authentication protocol in Microsoft LAN Manager (LANMAN), an older Microsoft product. NTLM is available in Mule 3.7 and later.

In this example, a GET request is sent to ++http://www.example.com/test++, adding an "Authorization" header with the provided username and password.

. Drag an HTTP Connector to your canvas, create a new Connector Configuration element for it
. Select the *Authentication* tab
. In the Protocol dropdown menu, pick *NTLM*
. Provide your Username and Password (or references to properties that contain them), also optionally your Domain and Workstation

[discrete.view]
=== XML Editor

NTML authentication is configured in the same way as Basic Authentication, just provide username and password in the attributes of the child element. The only difference is that the child element is differently named: "ntml-authentication" and that you can optionally add domain and workstation attributes.

In this example, a GET request is sent to ++http://www.example.com/test++, adding an "Authorization" header with the provided username and password.

== OAuth2 - Authorization Code

The OAuth2 - Authorization Code configures the OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant type. The OAuth authentication server holds the resources that are protected by OAuth. For example, calls to the Github API can be authenticated through https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/[Github server using OAuth]. The example in this section shows you how to create Mule client application to access a protected resource, Github user data, on the Github OAuth authentication server. The example covers the following things:

* Setup
* Creating the Mule client app
* Running the Mule client app

This example requires that you have a Github account.

=== Setup

First, you register the client application on the authentication server. The authentication server assigns a client ID and client secret to the Mule client app. The app uses these credentials later to identify itself to the authentication server. During the registration, you also provide the URL to the Mule app home page and the application callback URL.

image::authentication-in-http-requests-75e03.png[]


*To set up the example Mule client application:*

. Log in to Github.
. https://github.com/settings/applications/new[Register the application] in your Github personal settings. On the *Register a new OAuth application* page, fill in the following text boxes:
+
* Application name: Type an arbitrary application name. For this example, use `oauth-grant-code`.
* Homepage URL: For this example, use `+http://localhost:8082+`.
* Authorization callback URL: For this example, use `+http://localhost:8082/callback+`.
* Click *Register application*.
+
Github creates a page for the registered application on `+https://github.com/settings/applications/<app number>+` that includes the Github-assigned client ID and client secret.

=== Creating the Mule Client App

In this section, you create the Mule client app that uses the Github assigned client ID and client secret to access the user data on the Github OAuth2 authentication server. The sample consists of an HTTP listen connector, an HTTP request connector, and a DataWeave (Transform) component for transforming plain text to JSON. In the HTTP requester, you configure access to the authentication server.

In the following procedure, you configure a number of options, including these:

*  *localauthorizationUrl*
+
Defines a URL in your application that listens for incoming requests.
+
* *Authorization URL*
+
https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#web-application-flow[Provided by Github], this URL redirects the user request from the Mule client app to the Authorization URL of the Github authentication server.
+
* *Token URL*
+
The Mule client app sends the token to the *Token URL* that you configure in the Mule client app.

*To configure the Mule client app for accessing the Github authentication server:*

. On the *Authentication* tab, select `OAuth2 - Authorization Code`.
. Set the following options:
+
* Client Id: Type the client Id that Github provided when you registered the app.
* Client Secret: Type the client secret that Github provided when you registered the app.
* Redirection URL: `+http://localhost:8082/callback+`
+
This value matches the value you configured for *Authorization callback URL* when registering the app in Github.
* Authorization Url: `+https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize+`
* Local Authorization Url: `+https://localhost:8082/login+`
* Token Url: `+https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token+`
* Access Token: `#[payload.'access_token']`
+
This MEL expression <<extracting-parameters-from-the-token-url-response,extracts an access token>>.
+
* Refresh Token: `#[payload.'access_token']`
+
You can use the same MEL expression for the refresh token; however, Github doesn't actually use a refresh token.

=== XML Editor

Within the global configuration of the connector, add an `oauth2:authorization-code-grant-type` child element, include the following values in it:

* The *clientId* and *clientSecret*.
+
Use the client ID and client secret you received from Github when registering your application.
* The *redirectionUrl* to which the Github authentication server will send the access token once the RO grants you access.

If you were required to provide a redirect URL when registering your application with Github, this value must match what you provided there.

Inside this element, add a `oauth2:authorization-request` child element with the following attributes:

* The *authorizationUrl* that the Github authentication server exposes
* The *localauthorizationUrl*

Also, at the same level, add a `oauth2:token-request` child element with the following attribute:

* The *tokenUrl* that the Github authentication server exposes

=== Running the Mule Client App

After deploying the Mule client app, you follow the procedure in this section to run the app. The procedure covers the following actions:

* Submitting an HTTP request for Github access to the Mule client app (#1 in the following diagram)
+
The client app redirects the request to the Github authentication server (#2 in the diagram). Github prompts you to login and authorize the client app you registered.
* Using your Github login account credentials to log in and authorize the application (#3-4 in the diagram)
+
In response, the Github authentication server returns an *access token* (#5 in the diagram).
+
image::authentication-in-http-requests-42011.png[]
+
* Requesting the secured user data using the access token (#1-2 in the following diagram)
+
The client app gets the user data from the Github authentication server (#3 in the diagram).
+
image::authentication-in-http-requests-278ae.png[]

*To run the Mule client app to get Github user data:*

Perform these steps before the access token expires:

. Right-click the project name in project explorer, and choose *Run as* > *Mule Application*.
+
The console shows that the app is deployed.
+
. In a browser, enter the local authorization URL `+http://localhost:8082/login+` to initiate the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1[OAuth2 dance].
+
Github prompts you to log in.
+
. Log in using your Github user name and password.
+
Github prompts you to authorize the application you registered to run.
+
image::authentication-in-http-requests-96a5d.png[]
+
. Click *Authorize application*.
+
`Successfully retrieved access token` appears as body text in the browser you used to initiate the OAuth2 dance.
+
To return the token to get data, enter the following URL in a browser: `+http://localhost:8081/github+`
+
The Github API returns your user information.

=== Using Scopes

Configuring the *scopes* attribute in the Mule client app is optional, and not needed for the Github example. To configure scopes, define a comma separated list of OAuth scopes available in the authentication server. Scopes in OAuth are like security roles.

=== Sending Custom Parameters to the Authorization URL

There are OAuth implementations that require or allow extra query parameters to be sent when calling the Authentication URL of the OAS.

    </http:request-config>
----

=====

=== Overriding the Redirect URI (external redirect_uri)

The https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749[OAuth 2.0 specification] describes checking the redirect URI from the destination site of the redirect. The OAuth authentication server uses the URL to provide the authentication code to the Mule server for retrieving the access token. If you provide this URL, Mule creates an endpoint at the URL for storing the authentication code unless there’s already an endpoint registered to manually extract the authorization code.

You configure the external redirect URI by setting the system property `mule.oauth2.externalRedirectUrl`.

Using `mule.oauth2.externalRedirectUrl` is particularly useful for deploying applications to CloudHub, for example. In the configuration of authentication, you need to specify the redirectionURL in the following format:

For example, the redirectionURLis http://localhost:8082/callback in the <<creating-the-mule-client-app,previous example>>:

To create the endpoint for CloudHub, Mule has to create an endpoint for CloudHub in a different format. For example:

`+https://<app>.cloudhub.io/<redirect Uri>+`

To instruct Mule to create the endpoint for CloudHub in the correct format, include the `mule.oauth2.externalRedirectUrl` system property in your Mule properties file. For example:

----
mule.env=dev
mule.oauth2.externalRedirectUrl=http://<app>.cloudhub.io/callback
...
----

=== Extracting Parameters from the Token URL Response

After you have obtained an authorization code from the authentication server, you make a request to the Token URL of the server to receive an *access token*.

The format of the response to the request to the token URL is not defined in the OAuth spec. Each implementation may therefore return different response formats. By default, Mule expects the response to be in JSON format. When this is the case, the HTTP Response Connector knows how to extract the required information, as long as its elements are named as below:

* *access token*: JSON filed must be named `access_token`
* *refresh token*: JSON field must be named `refresh_token`
* *expires*: JSON field must be named `expires_in`

When the response is in JSON format, the parameters are automatically extracted and you can use xref:3.9@mule-runtime::mule-expression-language-mel.adoc[MEL expressions] to reference these values in the Mule Message that was generated from the response to the request to the token URL, as shown in the previous Github example.

When the response is not in JSON format, then you must first configure the connector so that it knows how to extract these values. In the following example, the connector expects the response to have a `Content-Type` of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, so the body of the response is transformed into a Map in the payload. You extract the values from the Map through MEL expressions, such as `#[payload.'access_token']`.

[.ex]
=====
[discrete.view]
=== Studio Visual Editor

On the *Authentication* tab, configure the options as follows for the *OAuth2 - Authorization Code*:

** Access Token: `#[payload.'access_token']`
** Expires In `#[payload.'expires_in']`
** Refresh Token `#[payload.'refresh_token']`

=====

=== Refresh Access Token Customization

The access token you obtain from the token URL eventually expires. The length of time the token is valid depends on the authentication server implementation. After the access token expires, instead of going through the whole process once again, you can retrieve a new access token by using the *refresh access token* provided by the token URL response.

Mule handles this use case automatically. So by default, when an HTTP Request Connector is executed, if the response has a status code of 403, mule call the token URL and gets a new access token.

You can customize when Mule performs one of these requests to obtain a new access token using a xref:3.9@mule-runtime::mule-expression-language-mel.adoc[MEL Expression]. The expression is evaluated against the Mule Message that is generated from the response of the HTTP Request Connector call.

[.ex]
=====
[discrete.view]
=== Studio Visual Editor

On the *Authentication* tab, configure the *Request Token When* field with the following MEL expression:
#`[xpath3('/response/status/text()', payload, 'STRING') == ‘unauthorized’]`

[discrete.view]
=== XML Editor

To set when to perform a call to obtain a new access token, set a MEL expression for the attribute `refreshTokenwhen` in the `oauth2:token-request` element.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<http:request-config name="HTTP_Request_Configuration" host="api.box.com" port="443" basePath="/2.0" doc:name="HTTP Request Configuration">
        <oauth2:authorization-code-grant-type clientId="your_client_id" clientSecret="your_client_secret" redirectionUrl="http://localhost:8082/redirectUrl">
            <oauth2:authorization-request authorizationUrl="http://www.box.com/api/oauth2/authorize" localAuthorizationUrl="http://localhost:8082/authorization"/>
            <oauth2:token-request tokenUrl="http://www.box.com/api/oauth2/token" refreshTokenWhen="#[xpath3('/response/status/text()', payload, 'STRING') == ‘unauthorized’]"/>
        </oauth2:authorization-code-grant-type>
    </http:request-config>
----

=====

When a request authorization fails, the response contains an XML node named *status* with value `‘unauthorized’`. In the previous example, the MEL expression evaluates that condition. When it evaluates to true, Mule sends a request to the Token URL to retrieve a new access token.

=== Accessing Resources on Behalf of Several Users

In the preceding examples, you authenticated a single user. You can handle access tokens for multiple users in a single application by defining a way to identify each user during the authorization period. During this period, you send a request to the Token URL to retrieve an access token and execute operations against the API with the acquired access token.

To identify which user is granting access to the Mule client app, define a MEL expression to retrieve a *Resource Owner ID* against the call to the local authorization URL.

[.ex]
=====
[discrete.view]
=== Studio Visual Editor

On the *Authentication* tab, configure the options as follows for the *OAuth2 - Authorization Code*: In the Advanced section of the Authentication tab, set:

* *Resource Owner ID* to `#[flowVars.'userId']`
* *Local Authorization URI*
#[message.inboundProperties.'http.query.params'.userId]

The field *Resource Owner ID* must be set with a MEL expression that allows each execution of the HTTP Request Connector to retrieve the RO identifier from the Mule Message. So on this example, whenever the HTTP Request Connector is executed, there must be a flow variable named ‘userId’ with the RO identifier to use. To create this variable, you can add a Variable transformer to your flow, positioned before the HTTP Request Connector, and configure the transformer to create the userId variable in the Mule Message.

The *Local Authorization* *URI* field (the one in the Advanced section), defines that in order to get the RO identifier, the `userId` query parameter must be parsed from the call done to the local authorization URL.

So if you hit `http://localhost:8082/authorization?userId=john`, then the RO john can grant access to the CA on his behalf. If you hit `http://localhost:8082/authorization?userId=peter` then the RO peter can grant access to the CA on his behalf.

----

The attribute `resourceOwnerId` must be set with a MEL expression that allows each `http:request` execution to retrieve the RO identifier from the Mule Message. So on this example, whenever the `http:request` is executed, there must be a flow variable named ‘userId’ with the RO identifier to use.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="accessROFolders">
        <set-variable variableName="userId" value="#['Peter']" doc:name="Variable"/>
        <http:request config-ref="HTTP_Request_Configuration" path="/folders" method="GET" doc:name="HTTP"/>
    </flow>
----

The attribute localAuthorizationUrlResourceOwnerId defines that, in order to get the RO identifier, the `userId` query parameter must be parsed from the call done to the local authorization URL.

So if you hit `http://localhost:8082/authorization?userId=john`, then the RO john can grant access to the CA on his behalf. If you hit `http://localhost:8082/authorization?userId=peter` then the RO peter can grant access to the CA on his behalf.

=== Use HTTPS for OAuth Authorization Code

When you need to use HTTPS for the communication with the authentication server, typical in a production environment, apply HTTPS encoding to the OAuth credentials in all requests, including those done to:

* the local authorization URL
* the authorization URL
* the redirect URL
* the token URL

By specifying a TLS context in your HTTP Request Connector authentication settings, this is handled in all of these requests.

[.ex]
=====
[discrete.view]
=== Studio Visual Editor

On the *Authentication* tab, configure the options as follows for the *OAuth2 - Authorization Code*:

. In the TLS configuration section, select *Use Global TLS Config*
. Click the green plus sign next to the field to create a new TLS Context
. Set up the trust store and key store configuration and click OK to save

The TLS settings in the Authentication tab encode your OAuth credentials. The TLS/SSL tab of the HTTP Request Configuration encode the request body.

== OAuth2 - Client Credentials

On the OAuth Authentication - Client Credentials tab you configure the client credentials grant type.

The OAuth Authentication Server (*OAS*) is a server that holds the resources that are protected by OAuth. ex: Box server provides an API with OAuth authentication.

The Client Application (*CA*) is the server that tries to access a protected resource that belongs to a resource owner and that is held in an OAuth authentication server. ex: a Mule Server trying to access the resources that belong to a Box user and that are held in a Box server.

In this case, the resource owner (RO) is also the CA. This means that the CA is implicitly authorized by the RO, which makes the whole procedure a lot simpler.

image::oauth-danceposta-simple.png[oauth dance post a simple]

. The CA must register an app to the OAS server. When this happens, the OAS assigns credentials to the CA that it can later use to identify itself: *client ID* and *client secret*. The OAS must also provide a *Token URL*, to which the CA can later send HTTP requests to retrieve an *access token* that is required when accessing the Protected Resources.
. The CA makes a request to the *Token URL* of the OAS, containing its client ID to prove its identity. As a response, the OAS grants it an *access token*.
. With this access token, the CA is now free to access the protected resources in the OAS as long as it includes it in its requests. Depending on the policies defined by the OAS, this token may eventually expire.

=== Configuration

Client credentials grant type is meant to be used by a CA to grant access to an application on behalf of itself, rather than on behalf of a RO (resource owner) in the OAS. To get an access token all you need is the application credentials.

. In the Protocol dropdown menu, pick *OAuth2 - Client Credentials*
. Fill in the following fields:

** The *Client Id* and *Client Secret* the OAS gave you when registering your application.
** The *Scopes* field is optional, it allows you to define a comma separated list of OAuth scopes available in the OAS. Scopes in OAuth are very much like security roles.
** The *Token URI* that the OAS exposes

When the mule application is deployed, it will try to retrieve an access token. If the app is not able to retrieve an access token, it will fail in the deployment.

=== Access Authorization Information Through the Token Manager

Once you have a token manager associated with the authorization grant type (in the example below, with authorization code) we can use the `oauthContext` function in a MEL expression anywhere in your flow to access information from an OAuth authorization.

If you're using *client credentials* or authorization code with a *single RO*, use the following function:

----
oauthContext(tokenManagerConfigName)
----

This function provides access to the OAuth authorization information from a token manager.

* `tokenManagerConfigName`: Name of a token manager in the configuration

If you're using authorization code with **multiple RO **, use the following function:

----
oauthContext(tokenManagerConfigName, resourceOwnerId)
----

This function provides access to OAuth authorization information from a token manager.

* `tokenManagerConfigName`: Name of a token manager in the configuration
* `resourceOwnerId`: Identifier of a RO.

==== Examples

This table includes examples of how to retrieve information from a Token Manager. Use these expressions in any processor in your flow that you place after the HTTP Request Connector that handles your OAuth authentication.

[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Function |Result
| `oauthContext(‘Token_Manager_Config’).accessToken` |accessToken value
| `oauthContext(‘Token_Manager_Config’, ‘Peter’).accessToken` |accessToken value for the RO identified with the id ‘Peter’
|`oauthContext(‘Token_Manager_Config’).refreshToken` |refreshToken value
| `oauthContext(‘Token_Manager_Config’).expiresIn` |expires in value
| `oauthContext(‘Token_Manager_Config’).state` |state used for the authorization URL
| `oauthContext(‘Token_Manager_Config’).`
`tokenResponseParameters.‘a_custom_param_name’`
|custom parameter extracted from the token URL response
| `oauthContext(‘Token_Manager_Config’, ‘Peter’).`
`tokenResponseParameters.‘a_custom_param_name’`
|custom parameter extracted from the token URL response for RO ‘Peter’.

=== Access Token Invalidation

When using a Token Manager, you can block a particular RO.

[.ex]
=====
[discrete.view]
=== Studio Visual Editor

. Drag an *Invalidate OAuth Context* element to your canvas.
. In its properties editor, set up the *Token Manager Configuration* so that it points to the same *Token Manager* that your HTTP Request Connector references when handling OAuth authentication.

[discrete.view]
=== XML Editor

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="invalidateOauthContext">
    <oauth2:invalidate-oauth-context config-ref="tokenManagerConfig"/>
</flow>
----

=====

The *Invalidate OAuth Context* element cleans up all of the OAuth information stored in the token manager.

When using multiple RO with a single Token Manager, if you want to only clear the OAuth information of one RO, then you must specify the resource owner id in the Invalidate OAuth Context element.

[.ex]
=====
[discrete.view]
=== Studio Visual Editor

. Drag an *Invalidate OAuth Context* element to your canvas.
. In its properties editor, set up the *Token Manager Configuration* so that it points to the same *Token Manager* that your HTTP Request Connector references when handling OAuth authentication.
. Set the *Resource Owner Id* to an expression that points to the RO you want to clear. For example
#`[flowVars.'resourceOwnerId']`

=== Customizing the Token Manager Object Store

By default, the token manager uses an in-memory object store to store the credentials. You can customize the token manager object store by using the objectStore-ref attribute. xref:3.9@mule-runtime::mule-object-stores.adoc[See how to configure a custom object store].

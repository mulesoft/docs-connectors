= HTTP Connector - Deprecated
:keywords: http connector, deprecated
:page-aliases: 3.9@mule-runtime::http-connector-deprecated.adoc

[TIP]
====
As of Mule 3.6 and later, the HTTP endpoint-based connector and transport has been replaced by an operation-based HTTP connector.

The legacy endpoint-based connector will be removed in a future version. See xref:index.adoc[HTTP Connector Overview] for more information about the HTTP operation-based connector and how to xref:migrating-to-the-new-http-connector.adoc[migrate] your projects to it.
====

Use the *HTTP Connector* to send and receive requests over HTTP transport protocol, or HTTPS over the SSL protocol. Configured as either *inbound* (also known as *message sources*) or *outbound*, HTTP endpoints use one of two message exchange patterns: *request-response* or *one-way*.

To learn more about endpoints, refer to xref:3.9@mule-runtime::anypoint-connectors.adoc[Anypoint Connectors].

== Configuration

Complete the following procedure to add an HTTP endpoint to a flow in your Mule application.

. In Studio, drag the *HTTP* icon from the Studio palette to the canvas. Position the endpoint at the beginning of a flow to use it as an inbound endpoint (see image below). Position the endpoint anywhere else in the flow to use it as an outbound endpoint.
. Double click the *HTTP* processor to open its properties editor.
. Refer to the sub-sections below to configure the HTTP endpoint within the tabs in the properties editor.

=== General Tab

[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
|Field |Description
|*Display Name* |Defaults to the generic endpoint name. Change the display name, which must be alpha-numeric, to reflect the endpoint's specific role, i.e. `Receive Order.`
|*Exchange Pattern* |Select whether the endpoint should be set to request-response or one-way.
|*Enable HTTPS* |Check this box to send http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure[HTTPS over SSL protocol]. If you enable HTTPS, ensure that you configure, then reference a global HTTPS connector on your endpoint.
|*Host* |Enter the location of the host server to which the HTTP must connect. Enter the location as a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) or an IP address. Defaults to `localhost`.
|*Port* |Enter a number to identify the port through which the HTTP endpoint must connect to the host server. Defaults to `8081.`
|*Path* |Specify the location in the host domain to which the HTTP must connect.
|*Connector Configuration* |Use the dropdown list to select a previously created connector configuration for this endpoint. If you have not created a connector configuration for this type of endpoint, you can do so from this window by clicking *Add*. Click *Edit* to modify a previously created global element.
|*Method* |_(Applies to outbound endpoints only.)_ Select the HTTP method the connector should use.
|===

=== Advanced Tab

[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
|Field |Description
|*Address* |Enter the address for this endpoint, i.e. http://localhost:8081/path.
|*Response Timeout* |Specify how long the endpoint must wait for a response (in ms). The default is **1000** ms. If set to 0, time out is disabled. +
|*Encoding* |Choose from a drop-down to identify the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_String_Encoding_Rules[string encoding] for a message (i.e. UTF-8).
|*Disable Transport Transformer* |To facilitate processing, an HTTP endpoint in Mule automatically applies default transformations to messages it receives. These default transformations make the message contents more “Mule friendly. However, if you want the HTTP endpoint to strictly maintain the data format of messages it receives, check the *Disable Transport Transformer* box.
|*MIME Type* |Select from the dropdown list one of the formats this endpoint supports. For example, set the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME#Content-Type[MIME type] to `text/HTML` on HTTP endpoints to handle plain text messages.
|*Follow Redirects* |_(Applies to outbound endpoints only.)_ If a GET request encounters a redirectLocation header, setting this to true forwards the request to the redirect URL. This only works when using GET since you cannot automatically follow redirects when performing a POST.
|*Connector Endpoint* |Use the dropdown list to select a previously configured global endpoint reference. If you have not created a global element for this type of endpoint, you can do so from this window by clicking *Add*. Click *Edit* to modify a previously created global element.
|*Enable default events tracking* |Enable default xref:3.9@mule-runtime::business-events.adoc[business event] tracking for this endpoint.
|===

[NOTE]
====
*Host and Path, or Address?* +

If you enter the URI for the host server in the *Address* field, you don’t need to enter any information in the *Host* and *Path* fields. Similarly, if you entered host server information in the *Host* and *Path* fields, you don’t need to enter a URI in the *Address* field.

Apply either the *Host* and *Path* attributes, OR the *Address* attribute to an HTTP endpoint.
====

=== Transformers Tab

image::studio-http-trans.png[]

[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
|Property |Description
|*Request Transformer References* |Enter a list of synchronous transformers to apply to the request before it is sent to the transport.
|*Response Transformer References* |Enter a list of synchronous transformers to apply to the response before it is returned from the transport.
|===

[NOTE]
====
*What is a Connector Configuration?* +

Mule uses *Global Elements*, like the *HTTP/HTTP Connector Configuration* and the *HTTP Polling Connector Configuration*, to set reusable configurations.

Rather than repeatedly write the same code to apply the same configuration to multiple message processors, you can create one global element that details your configurations or transport details. Then, instruct any number of message processors in your Mule application to reference that global element.

Global transport configurations do not exist within a Mule flow. Rather, the configurations reside in a global connector on the *Global Elements* tab on the Studio canvas, or at the top of the application in the XML configuration. An HTTP endpoint in a flow simply references a global connector to obtain transport configuration details.
====

=== HTTP Settings Tab

image::studio-http-settings.png[]

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|*User* |Enter the username that the HTTP endpoint uses to identify itself to the host server.
|*Password* |Enter the password that the HTTP endpoint uses to identify itself to the host server.
|*Content Type* |Use the drop-down box to select the type of content the HTTP request or response contains.
|*Keep Alive* |Check the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keepalive[Keep Alive] box to maintain an open socket connection when a small interruption occurs.

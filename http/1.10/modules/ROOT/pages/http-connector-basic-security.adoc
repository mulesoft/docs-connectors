= Configuring Basic Security Filter for HTTP Connector

Consider a Mule app that exposes an API for accessing sensitive customer information, such as personal details and order history. To secure this API, you want to implement basic security using a username and password combination. The Anypoint Platform for HTTP (HTTP Connector) *Basic Security Filter* operation enables you to enforce basic authentication. 

The following example illustrates how to configure the *Basic Security Filter* operation to ensure that only authorized users can access the protected API.

. In Anypoint Studio, add an *HTTP Listener* source to your flow. This serves as the entry point for incoming API requests.
. Drag the *Basic Security Filter* operation after the *HTTP Listener*. The operation validates the username and password provided in the request headers.
. Select the *Basic Security Filter* operation from your flow.
. Configure the *Basic Security Filter* operation with the authentication *Realm* and *Security providers*.
. Continue building your Mule flow by adding the logic for handling API requests, retrieving customer information, or performing other operations.

In the *Configuration XML*, the configuration looks like this:
[source,xml,linenums]
----
 <http:listener-config name="HTTP_Listener_config" >
		<http:listener-connection host="0.0.0.0" port="8081" />
	</http:listener-config>
	<flow name="testFlow1">
		<http:listener config-ref="HTTP_Listener_config" path="/test"/>
		<http:basic-security-filter realm="MuleRealm">
			<http:security-providers >
				<http:security-provider value="test" />
			</http:security-providers>
		</http:basic-security-filter>
        <!-- Add your API logic here -->
    </flow>

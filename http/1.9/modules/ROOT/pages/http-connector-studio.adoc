= Using Anypoint Studio to Configure HTTP Connector 1.9 - Mule 4

Anypoint Studio (Studio) editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.

To add and configure a connector in Studio:

. <<create-mule-project,Create a Mule project>>.
. <<add-connector-to-project,Add the connector to your Mule project>>.
. <<configure-source,Configure a source for the connector's flow>>.
. <<add-connector-operation,Add a connector operation to the flow>>.
. <<configure-global-element,Configure a global element for the connector>>.

When you run the connector, you can view the app log to check for problems in real time, as described in <<view-app-log,View the App Log>>.

If you are new to configuring connectors in Studio, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-config-use-studio.adoc[Use Studio to Configure a Connector]. If, after reading this topic, you need additional information about the connector fields, see the xref:http-documentation.adoc[HTTP Connector Reference].

[[create-mule-project]]
== Create a Mule Project

In Studio, create a new Mule project in which to add and configure the connector:

. In Studio, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
. Enter a name for your Mule project and click *Finish*.

[[add-connector-to-project]]
== Add the Connector to Your Mule Project

Add HTTP Connector to your Mule project to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location and add the required dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file:

. In *Mule Palette*, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Dependencies to Project*, type `http` in the search field.
. Click *HTTP* in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.

[[configure-source]]
== Configure a Source

A source initiates a flow when a specified condition is met.
You can configure one of these sources to use with HTTP Connector:

* HTTP *Listener* +
Initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port
* *Scheduler* +
Initiates a flow when a time-based condition is met

For example, to configure an HTTP *Listener* source, follow these steps:

. In *Mule Palette*, select *HTTP > Listener*.
. Drag *Listener* to the Studio canvas.
. On the *Listener* configuration screen, optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. Specify a value for the *Path* field.
. Click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of the HTTP Listener source in the app.
. On the *General* tab, specify connection information for the connector.
. On the *TLS* tab, optionally specify the TLS information for the connector.
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

[[add-connector-operation]]
== Add a Connector Operation to the Flow

When you add a connector operation to your flow, you are specifying an action for that connector to perform.

To add an operation for HTTP Connector, follow these steps:

. In *Mule Palette*, select *HTTP* and then select the desired operation.
. Drag the operation onto the Studio canvas, next to the input source.

You can configure one of these operations to use with HTTP Connector:

* *Basic security filter* +
Secures and authenticates requests to your service.
* *Load a static resource* +
Brings a resource, such as a script, from the file system into your Mule app to be returned by an HTTP *Listener* source.
* *Request* +
Consumes an HTTP service.

[[configure-global-element]]
== Configure a Global Element for the Connector

When you configure a connector, configure a global element that all instances of that connector in the app can use.

For example, to configure the global element for the HTTP *Listener* source, follow these steps:

. Select the source in the Studio canvas.
. In the *General* configuration screen for the operation, click the *Add* icon (image:add-16x16.png[2%,2%]) to access the global element configuration fields.
. In the *General* tab, set the following fields:
+
* *Protocol*: `HTTP (Default)` or `HTTPS`
* *Host*: `All Interfaces [0.0.0.0] (default)`
* *Port*: `8081`
+
[start=4]
. In the *TLS* tab, optionally specify the TLS information for the connector.
. In the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

[[view-app-log]]
== View the App Log

To check for problems, you can view the app log as follows:

* If you’re running the app from Anypoint Platform, the app log output goes to the Anypoint Studio console window.
* If you’re running the app using Mule from the command line, the app log output goes to your operating system console.

Unless the log file path is customized in the app’s log file (`log4j2.xml`), you can also access the app log in the default location `MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`. You can configure the location of the log path in the app log file `log4j2.xml`.

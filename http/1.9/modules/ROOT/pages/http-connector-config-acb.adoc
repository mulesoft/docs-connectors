[[create-integration-project]]
== Create a New Integration Project

To create a new integration project:

// Open the ACB IDE
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-ide"]
. From *Quick Actions*, click *Develop an Integration*:
+
image::develop-integration-option-mat.png["Develop an Integration link highlighted in the Getting started section"]
. Complete the *Develop an Integration* form.
+
[%header,cols="20a,60a"] 
|===
| Field Name | Field Value

| *Project Name* | Unique name for your project.

This name is used as the title and name of the integration project file.
For example, if the project name is "My Project," the project file name is `my-project.xml`.
| *Project Location* | Your home directory or another directory you create. Click *Browse* to select a different directory for the integration.

See xref:start-add-folders.adoc[].

include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="proj-directory-warn"]
|===
. Click *Create Project*.


[[add-components]]
== Add a Source Component to Your Project

A source (or trigger) initiates a flow when a specified condition is met.
You can configure one of these sources to use with HTTP Connector:

* HTTP *Listener* +
Initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port
* *Scheduler* +
Initiates a flow when a time-based condition is metThe listener is for triggering the flow, and Set Payload provides some test data for the integration.

. In the Explorer view, select the XML file for your project, such as `my-project.xml`:
+
image::int-empty-canvas.png["Canvas showing visual representation of Mule flow and the Mule configuration file"]
+
[calloutlist]
.. The canvas provides space for a visual representation of your Mule flows or subflows.
.. The configuration XML editor displays the configuration file for your Mule application.
. Select *Build a Flow* from the canvas to create an empty flow.
. 
. In the configuration XML, replace the name of the flow `name1` with your flow name, for example, `getFlights`.
. Add a component to your project from the canvas, for example, add the HTTP Listener component:
.. In the canvas, click the image:icon-plus.png["",15,15] (*Add component*) icon.
.. In the *Add Component* panel, search for and select *Listener* from the *HTTP* results:
+
image::main-tutorial-add-first-listener.png["Listener component highlighted in the Add Component section"]
+
The configuration XML file now includes the XML for the HTTP Listener into the `<flow/>` element, for example:
+
[source,XML]
----
<flow name="getFlights" >
  <http:listener path="" config-ref="" doc:name="Listener" doc:id="ojzfry" />

</flow>
----
. Add another component, this time using the XML configuration menu.
For example, add the `<http:listener-config/>` component from a snippet.
+
For more information about snippets, see xref:int-work-with-code-snippets.adoc[].
+
.. In the configuration XML, place your cursor before the `<flow/>` element and type `http`.
+
Ensure that the cursor is not inside the `<flow/>` element.
+
.. Type `http`, and select the `http:listener-config` snippet:
+
image::add-http-config-snippet.png["http:listener-config snippet highlighted in the configuration XML menu"]
+
The snippet adds the following code:
+
[source,xml]
----
<http:listener-config name="HTTP_Listener_config" >
  <http:listener-connection host="0.0.0.0" port="8081" />
</http:listener-config>
----
. Add another component to your flow.
+
For example, add a Set Payload component to your HTTP Listener operation:
+
.. In the canvas, click the image:icon-plus.png["",15,15] (*Add component*) icon.
.. In the *Add Component* panel, search for and select *Set payload* from the *Transformer* results.


Your configuration XML file now looks similar to the following:

[source,xml]
--
  <http:listener-config name="HTTP_Listener_config" >
    <http:listener-connection host="0.0.0.0" port="8081" />
  </http:listener-config>

  <flow name="getFlights" >
    <http:listener path="" config-ref="" doc:name="Listener" doc:id="uvapcx" />
    <set-payload value="" doc:name="Set payload" doc:id="hnxirg" />
    
  </flow>
--

Notice that the Listener component in the canvas now shows an error:

image::int-canvas-error.png["Listener error in the canvas"]

To determine where the error is, select the processor in the canvas.
Anypoint Code Builder highlights its location within the configuration XML, for example:

image::int-error-highlight.png["HTTP Listener highlighted in the flow and in the XML code"]

To fix the error, configure the attributes.

For more information about debugging, see xref:debugging-mule-apps.adoc[].


[[import-connectors-from-exchange]]
== Import a Connector from Exchange

Anypoint Connectors provide operations for retrieving, modifying, and sending data to and from systems.
In addition to the xref:acb-components.adoc#builtin-connectors[built-in connectors] that Anypoint Code Builder provides,
you can download many other connectors from Anypoint Exchange.

To import a connector from Exchange and add it to your configuration:

. In the Explorer view, open the configuration XML file for your project, such as `my-project-name.xml`.
. Click the image:icon-tree-view.png["",15,15] (*Show Mule graphical mode*) icon in the activity bar to open the UI canvas if it doesn't open automatically.
. Add the connector the same way you added other components from the canvas:
.. In the canvas, click the image:icon-plus.png["",15,15] (*Add component*) icon.
.. In the *Add Component* panel, click *Connectors*.
.. Click the connector name and then click the operation to add, such as *Publish*:
+
image::int-add-connector-operation.png["Add Publish operation from the Anypoint MQ Connector"]
+
If the connector is not available locally, click the image:icon-search-exchange.png["",15,15] (*Search in Exchange*) toggle:
+
image::int-connector-search-exchange.png["Search in Exchange toggle"]
+
--
[calloutlist]
. Search locally
. Search in Exchange
--
.. Select the connector to add to your project.
.. Select the operation from the *Add Component* panel.


To import a connector from Exchange to use later in your project:

. In the Explorer view, open the configuration XML file for your project, such as `my-project-name.xml`.
. Click the image:icon-tree-view.png["",15,15] (*Show Mule graphical mode*) icon in the activity bar to open the canvas UI if it doesn't open automatically.
// Pointer to Command Palette
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-command-palette"]
. Select the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Import Asset from Exchange
----
. Select *Connector*.
. Search for the connector name to import, such as "MQ", for example:
+
image::int-import-connect-exchange.png["Import MQ Connector from Exchange]
. Select the connector.
. At the prompt, select the version of the connector to import, such as `v4.0.3`.
+
Anypoint Code Builder imports the connector and makes it available in the Components list.

For more information about the connectors available on Exchange, see 
xref:connectors::index.adoc[]. 
For more information about Exchange, see 
https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Exchange (US)^] or
https://eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Exchange (EU)^]
and
xref:exchange::index.adoc[].


[[configure-attributes]]
== Configure Attributes for a Component

After you add the components to the project, configure the attributes. 

For example, configure these attributes for the `<http:listener-config/>`,  `<http:listener/>`, and `<set-payload/>` elements:

[source,xml]
----
<http:listener-config name="inbound-request" doc:name="Listener Config" doc:id="b5c62f-a84a3a"> 
  <http:listener-connection host="0.0.0.0" port="8081"/> 
</http:listener-config>

<flow name="getFlights">
    <http:listener path="flights" config-ref="inbound-request" doc:name="HTTP /flights" doc:id="htprur" />
    <set-payload value="Flight info" doc:name="Set Response" doc:id="e43e98-1a9a01"/>
</flow>
----

[[check-connection]]
== Test an HTTP Listener Connection

To test an HTTP Listener connection, click *Test Connection* in the configuration XML:

image::http-listener-test-connection.png["HTTP Listener Test Connection link in the configuration XML"]

The status bar shows the progress:

* *Verifying connection inbound-request* indicates that the test is in progress.
* *Connection is valid* indicates a successful connection. 
* *Invalid Connection Got status code: 500 when trying to resolve a Mule Runtime operation* indicates a connection error.
+
A common code `500` error is `port 8081: Address already in use`. For port conflicts, configure a different port, such as `8082`, and retest the connection. 

Before publishing, run your application in debug mode.


[[create-new-config]]
== Create a New Configuration XML File

Anypoint Code Builder creates the initial Mule configuration XML file in `src/main/mule`
within the Mule project.
This file contains global configurations and flow structures.

You can create additional configuration files, for example to store global configurations.

To create a new XML configuration file:

. In the Explorer view, right-click the *mule* folder (`src/main/mule`) and select *New File*.
+
Alternatively, use the menu.
+
.Show me how
[%collapsible]
====
Select the `mule` folder, and then:

** In the desktop IDE, select *File* > *New File*.
** In the cloud IDE, click the image:icon-menu.png["",18,18] (menu) icon, and select *File* > *New File*.
====
. Enter a name for the new file with the `.xml` extension.
. In the Editor view for the new file, press Ctrl+Space to display available options.
. Select *Empty mule configuration*:
+
image::int-new-mule-config.png[New mule configuration option in auto-correct]
+
This command adds the following code to the file:
+

= HTTP Connector 1.9 Reference - Mule 4
:page-aliases: connectors::http/http-documentation.adoc




Use Anypoint Connector for HTTP (HTTP Connector) to handle and perform HTTP requests. This class
only serves as an extension definition. This
connector's configurations are divided between a server (`<http:listener-config>`) and a client (`<http:requester-config>`). capabilities.

Release Notes: xref:release-notes::connector/connector-http.adoc[HTTP Connector Release Notes]

== Configurations

[[listenerConfig]]
=== Listener Configuration


Configuration element for a HttpListener.


==== Parameters
[%header,cols="20s,20a,35a,20a,5a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | |x
| Connection a| <<listenerConfig_listener, Listener>>
 | The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | |x
| Base Path a| String |  Base path to use for all requests that reference this config. |  |
| Listener Interceptors a| <<CorsInterceptorWrapper>> |  Listener interceptors that will apply on request and on response events. |  |
| Reject Invalid Transfer Encoding a| Boolean |  If `true`, requests with an invalid value for Transfer-Encoding header are rejected with a 400 Bad Request message. The valid values are `chunked`, `deflate`, `compress`, `identity` and `gzip`. These values are defined in `RFC-7230` and `RFC-2616`. |  false |
|===

==== Connection Types
[[listenerConfig_listener]]
===== Listener


Connection provider for a HttpListener, handles the creation of HttpServer instances.


====== Parameters
[%header,cols="20s,20a,35a,20a,5a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| TLS Configuration a| <<Tls>> |  Reference to a TLS config element. This will enable HTTPS for this config. |  |
| Protocol a| Enumeration, one of:

** HTTP
** HTTPS |  Protocol to use for communication. Valid values are HTTP and HTTPS. Default value is HTTP. When using HTTPS the HTTP communication is going to be secured using TLS / SSL. If HTTPS was configured as protocol then the user needs to configure at least the keystore in the tls:context child element of this listener-config. |  HTTP |
| Host a| String |  Host where the requests will be sent. |  |x
| Port a| Number |  Port where the requests will be received. |  |x
| Use Persistent Connections a| Boolean |  If false, each connection will be closed after the first request is completed. |  true |
| Connection Idle Timeout a| Number |  The number of milliseconds that a connection can remain idle before it is closed. The value of this attribute is only used when persistent connections are enabled. The listener default timeout is bigger than the requester default timeout to avoid the Remotely closed exception when you send a request on an existing connection just before the timeout occurs. |  40000 |
| Read Timeout a| Number | Maximum time in milliseconds that the listener must wait while receiving a message. |  30000 |
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to true, deployment will fail if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy |  |

==== Parameters
[%header,cols="20s,20a,35a,20a,5a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | |x
| Connection a| <<requestConfig_request, Request>>
 | The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | |x
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform will expire the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime will actually purge the instances when it sees it fit. |  |
| Base Path a| String |  Base path to use for all requests that reference this config. |  / |
| Follow Redirects a| Boolean |  Specifies whether to follow redirects or not. Default value is true. |  true |
| Send Body Mode a| Enumeration, one of:

** ALWAYS
** AUTO
** NEVER |  Defines if the request should contain a body or not. If AUTO, it will depend on the method (GET, HEAD and OPTIONS will not send a body). |  AUTO |
| Request Streaming Mode a| Enumeration, one of:

** AUTO
** ALWAYS
** NEVER |  Defines if the request should be sent using streaming or not. If this attribute is not present, the behavior will depend on the type of the payload (it will stream only for InputStream). If set to true, it will always stream. If set to false, it will never stream. As streaming is done the request will be sent user Transfer-Encoding: chunked. |  AUTO |
| Enable Cookies a| Boolean |  If true, cookies received in HTTP responses will be stored, and sent in subsequent HTTP requests. |  true |
| Default Headers a| Array of <<defaultHeader>> |  Default HTTP headers the message should include. |  |
| Query Parameters a| Array of <<QueryParam>> |  Default Query parameters the request should include. |  |
| Send Correlation Id a| Enumeration, one of:

** AUTO
** ALWAYS
** NEVER |  Whether to specify a correlation id when publishing messages. This applies both for custom correlation ids specified at the operation level and for default correlation ids taken from the current event. |  AUTO |
| Preserve Headers Case a| Boolean |  By default, header keys are stored internally in lower-case. This is to improve performance of headers handling and is functionally correct as specified in the RFC. <p> In the case a server expects headers in a specific case, this flag may be set to true so the case of the header keys are preserved. |  false |
| Response Timeout a| Number |  Maximum time in milliseconds that the request element blocks the execution of the flow waiting for the HTTP response. If this value is not present, the connector uses the default response timeout from the Mule configuration, which is also 10000 | 10000 |
| Response Validator a| One of:

* <<SuccessStatusCodeValidator>>
* <<FailureStatusCodeValidator>> |  Configures a default error handling of the response. |  |

| Protocol a| Enumeration, one of:

** HTTP
** HTTPS |  Protocol to use for communication. Valid values are HTTP and HTTPS. Default value is HTTP. When using HTTPS the HTTP communication is going to be secured using TLS/SSL. If HTTPS was configured as protocol, then the user can customize the TLS/SSL configuration by defining the `tls:context` child element of this listener-config.

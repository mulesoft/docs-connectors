= Configure HTTP Requests Authentication - Mule 4
:page-aliases: connectors::http/http-authentication.adoc

The Anypoint Connector for HTTP (HTTP Connector) *Request* operation supports connecting a Mule client app to a service that requires any of the following types of authentication:

* <<Basic Authentication>>
* <<Digest Authentication>>
* <<NTLM Authentication>>
* <<OAuth2 - Authorization Code>>
* <<OAuth2cc>>


If the target HTTP service of your request requires that you authenticate, provide the necessary credentials in the HTTP *Request* operation global configuration element. Mule runtime engine (Mule) uses the credentials you configured in the authorization header of the HTTP request.

You can also configure Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt the OAuth credentials.

To protect your API or Mule app from receiving requests from unauthorized access, use an API Manager policy, refer to the xref:api-manager::external-oauth-2.0-token-validation-policy.adoc[OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider] documentation.

[NOTE]
In Anypoint Studio, for the HTTP *Request* operation global configuration, even though the *Expression* option is available for the *Authentication* field, the option is not an authentication method and should not be used as such.


== HTTP XML Authentication Setup

If you are using Anypoint Studio (Studio), you can use the *Authentication* field for the HTTP Request
connector to select an authentication type.

The XML values for authentication in the HTTP connector are:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Authentication Type | XML Value
|Basic Authentication a|

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<http:authentication >
  <http:basic-authentication
  username="UN" password="PW"/>
</http:authentication>
----
|NTLM Authentication a|

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<http:authentication >
  <http:ntlm-authentication
  domain="DM" workstation="WS"
  username="UN" password="PW" />
</http:authentication>
----
|Digest Authentication a|

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<http:authentication >
  <http:digest-authentication
  username="UN" password="PW"/>
</http:authentication>
----

|===

In addition, in Studio you can add an OAuth component's operation to the canvas, which
automatically adds the following dependency to the project's pom.xml file:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mule.modules</groupId>
    <artifactId>mule-oauth-module</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.8</version>
    <classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
</dependency>
----

Use of the OAuth component's operations are discussed starting with <<Create the Mule Client App>>.

== Configure Basic Authentication

To configure the basic authentication for the HTTP *Request* operation refer to the following Mule app example that sends a request to the https://developer.github.com/v3[GitHub API] for user information. The GitHub API accepts requests for user information on port 443 to `+https://api.github.com/user+`.
To comply with the basic authentication requirements, the Mule app provides the GitHub user name and password. You configure the HTTP *Request* operation to provide these credentials.

Note that this example requires that you have a GitHub account.

. In Studio > *Mule Palette*, select *HTTP > Listener*.
. Drag *Listener* to the Studio canvas.
. Set *Path * to `/`.
. Click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of the source in the app.
. In the *HTTP Listener config* window set the following fields:
+
* *Protocol*: `HTTP (Default)`
* *Host*: `All Interfaces [0.0.0.0] (default)`
* *Port*: `8081`
+
[start=6]
. Click *OK*.
. In the *Advanced* tab, set *Allowed methods* to `GET`.
. Drag an HTTP *Request* operation next to the HTTP *Listener* source.
. Click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of the source in the app.
. In the *HTTP Request configuration* window set the following fields:
+
** *Name*: `HTTP_Request_configuration`.
** *Protocol*: `HTTPS`
** *Host*: `api.github.com`
** *Port*: `443`
+
[start=11]
. Set *Authentication* to *Basic authentication*.
. Set *Username* to your GitHub username account.
. Set *Password* to your GitHub password account, or a https://github.com/settings/tokens[personal access token].
. Set *Preemptive* to *True (Default)*.
. Click *OK*.
+
image::http-basic-authentication-1.png[HTTP Request basic authentication window configuration]
+
. In the HTTP *Request* configuration window, set *Method* to *GET (Default)*.
. Set *Path* to `/user`.
+
image::http-basic-authentication-2.png[HTTP Request configuration with Method and Path]
+
. In the *Mule Palette*, select *Core > Transform message*.
. Drag *Transform message* component to the right of the HTTP *Request* operation.
. In the *Output* properties window, change the ouput to the following DataWeave code:
+
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/json
---
payload
----
+

. Save your Mule app.
. Click *Run > Run as > Mule Application*.
. To call the API, in your internet browser send the following URL: `+http://localhost:8081/+`
+
The GitHub API returns your user information, for example:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
    "login":"kahn",
    "id":16xxx343,
    "avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16xxx343?v=3"`
    ...
}
----

If the browser returns `HTTP GET on resource 'https://api.github.com:443/user' failed: unauthorized (401)`, you need to use a https://github.com/settings/tokens[personal access token] instead of
specifying your GitHub password. If you are generating a new token, you need only the *user* > *read:user* scope.

== Configure Digest Authentication

. Drag an *HTTP* > *Request* operation from the Mule Palette to the Process area of the Studio flow. This operation is known as the HTTP Request connector.
. In the properties editor for *Connector Configuration*, click the green plus icon.
. Select the *Authentication* tab.
. In the Protocol dropdown menu, pick *Digest authentication*.
. Provide your Username and Password (or references to properties that contain them).

=== Digest Authentication - XML Editor

Digest authentication is configured in the same way as Basic Authentication, just provide your username and password in the attributes of the child element. The only difference is that the child element is differently named: "digest-authentication".

[source,text,linenums]

...
<http:request-config name="HTTP_Request_configuration"
      doc:name="HTTP Request configuration" >
    <http:request-connection host="example.com" port="8081" >

<flow name="digest_flow">
    ...
    <http:request config-ref="HTTP_Request_configuration"
    path="test"
    method="GET" />

</flow>
----

In this example, a GET request is sent to `+http://www.example.com/test+`, adding an "Authorization" header with the provided username and password.


== Configure NTLM Authentication

NT LAN Manager (NTLM) authentication replaces the authentication protocol in Microsoft LAN Manager (LANMAN), an older Microsoft product.

In this example, a GET request is sent to `+http://www.example.com/test+`, adding an "Authorization" header with the provided username and password.

== Configure OAuth2 - Authorization Code

The OAuth2 - Authorization Code configures the OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant type. The OAuth authentication server holds the resources that are protected by OAuth. For example, calls to the GitHub API can be authenticated through https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/[GitHub server using OAuth]. The example in this section shows you how to create Mule client application to access a protected resource, GitHub user data, on the GitHub OAuth authentication server. The example covers the following things:

* Set up authorization
* Create a Mule client app
* Run the Mule client app

This example requires that you have a GitHub account.

=== Set Up Authorization

. Register the client application on the authentication server. The authentication server assigns a client ID and client secret to the Mule client app. The app uses these credentials later to identify itself to the authentication server. During the registration, you also provide the URL to the Mule app home page and the application callback URL.
+
image::authentication-in-http-requests-75e03.png[]
+
. Log in to GitHub.
. https://github.com/settings/applications/new[Register the application] in your GitHub personal settings. On the *Register a new OAuth application* page, fill in the following text boxes:
+
* *Application name*: Type an arbitrary application name. For this example, use `oauth-grant-code`.
* *Homepage URL*: For this example, use `+http://localhost:8082+`.
* *Authorization callback URL*: For this example, use `+http://localhost:8082/callback+`.
* Click *Register application*.
+
GitHub creates a page for the registered application on `+https://github.com/settings/applications/<app number>+` that includes the GitHub-assigned client ID and client secret.

=== Create the Mule Client App

You can create a Mule client app that uses the GitHub assigned client ID and client secret to access the user data on the GitHub OAuth2 authentication server. The sample consists of an HTTP Listener connector, an HTTP Request connector, and a DataWeave (Transform) component for transforming plain text to JSON. In the HTTP Request connector, you configure access to the authentication server.

In the following procedure, you can configure a number of options, including:

*  *Local authorization URL*
+
Defines a URL in your application that listens for incoming requests.
+
* *Authorization URL*
+
https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#web-application-flow[Provided by GitHub], this URL redirects the user request from the Mule client app to the Authorization URL of the GitHub authentication server.
+
* *Token URL*
+
The Mule client app sends the token to the *Token URL* that you configure in the Mule client app.

The following sections help you configure the Mule client app for accessing the GitHub authentication server.

=== OAuth 2 Authorization - Studio Visual Editor

. Drag an *HTTP* > *Request* operation from the Mule Palette to the Process area of the Studio flow. This operation is known as the HTTP Request connector.
. Expand the Package Explorer and double-click the `pom.xml` file.
. At the end of the `<dependencies>` section and before the `</dependencies>` statement,
add these statements to enable OAuth options for the HTTP Request connector:
+
[[setpomfile]]
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mule.modules</groupId>
    <artifactId>mule-oauth-module</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.8</version>
    <classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
</dependency>
----
+
. In the properties editor for *Connector Configuration*, click the green plus icon (or click the Edit icon if you have already created a configuration).
. Set the *Authentication* field to *Authorization code grant type*.
. Set the following required fields:
+
** *External callback url*: `+http://myapp.mycompany.com:8082/callback+`
+
The OAuth authentication server uses this URL to provide the authentication code to the Mule server so that the Mule server can retrieve the access token. This must be the externally visible address of the callback, not the local one.
+
** *Local authorization url*: `+https://localhost:8082/login+`
+
Lets you authenticate and grant access to the app for your account.
+
** *Authorization url*: `+https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize+`
+
Authorize the app for a user.
+
** *Client id*: Type the client ID that GitHub provided when you registered the app.
** *Client secret*: Type the client secret that GitHub provided when you registered the app.
** Token url: `+https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token+`
+
You can also set these optional fields:
+
** *Local callback url*: `+http://localhost:8082/callback+`
+
This value matches the value you configured for *External callback URL* when registering the app in GitHub. This is the configuration of the server that Mule creates to receive the requests that a remote host sends to the `externalCallbackUrl`. External and internal callback URLs are the same, just that one is the configuration to create a server in the runtime (internal) and the other is how that server is seen from the internet (external).
+
** *Response Access Token*: `#[payload.access_token]`
+
This DataWeave expression <<extracting-parameters-from-the-token-url-response,extracts an access token>>.
+
** *Response Refresh Token*: `#[payload.access_token]`
+
You can use a similar DataWeave expression for the refresh token (that is: `#[payload.refresh_token]`) if the provider you are using sends a refresh token. In this example, however, GitHub doesn't actually use a refresh token.
+
image::authentication-in-http-requests-c2070.png[]
+
. Click OK.
. Save changes.

=== OAuth 2 Authorization - XML Editor

Within the global configuration of the connector, add an `<http:authentication` > block
containing an `oauth:authorization-code-grant-type` child element.
Include the following values in it:

* The `clientId` and `clientSecret`.
+
Use the client ID and client secret you received from GitHub when registering your application.
* The `localCallbackUrl` to which the GitHub authentication server sends the access token once the resource owner (RO) grants you access.

If you were required to provide a redirect URL when registering your application with GitHub, this value must match what you provided there.

Add the following attributes:

* The `authorizationUrl` that the GitHub authentication server exposes
* The `localauthorizationUrl`

Also, add the following attribute:

* The `tokenUrl` that the GitHub authentication server exposes

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<http:listener-config name="HTTP_Listener_Configuration"
                      host="0.0.0.0" port="8081" basePath="/github"/>

                     protocol="HTTPS" host="api.github.com" port="443">
    <http:authentication>
        <oauth:authorization-code-grant-type
        externalCallbackUrl="http://myapp.mycompany.com:8082/callback"
        localAuthorizationUrl="http://localhost:8082/login"
        authorizationUrl="https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize"
        clientId="CLIENT_ID"
        clientSecret="CLIENT_SECRET"
        tokenUrl="https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token" />
    </http:authentication>
</http:request-config>
----

NOTE: The `localAuthorizationUrl` value matches the value you configured for *External callback URL* when registering the app in GitHub. This is the configuration of the server that Mule creates to receive the requests that a remote host sends to the `externalCallbackUrl`. External and internal callback URLs are the same, just that one is the configuration to create a server in the runtime (internal) and the other is how that server is seen from the internet (external).

=== OAuth 2 Authorization - Run the Mule Client App

After deploying the Mule client app, you follow the procedure in this section to run the app. The procedure covers the following actions:

* Submitting an HTTP request for GitHub access to the Mule client app (#1 in the following diagram).
+
The client app redirects the request to the GitHub authentication server (#2 in the diagram). GitHub prompts you to login and authorize the client app you registered.
* Using your GitHub login account credentials to log in and authorize the application (#3-4 in the diagram).
+
In response, the GitHub authentication server returns an *access token* (#5 in the diagram).
+
image::authentication-in-http-requests-42011.png[]
+
* Requesting the secured user data using the access token (#1-2 in the following diagram).
+
The client app gets the user data from the GitHub authentication server (#3 in the diagram).
+
image::authentication-in-http-requests-278ae.png[]

To run the Mule client app to get GitHub user data:

Perform these steps before the access token expires:

. Right-click the project name in project explorer, and choose *Run as* > *Mule Application*.
+
The console shows that the app is deployed.
+
. In a browser, enter the local authorization URL `+http://localhost:8082/login+` to initiate the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1[OAuth2 dance].
+
GitHub prompts you to log in.
+
. Log in using your GitHub user name and password.
+
GitHub prompts you to authorize the application you registered to run.
+
image::authentication-in-http-requests-96a5d.png[]
+
. Click *Authorize application*.
+
`Successfully retrieved access token` appears as body text in the browser you used to initiate the OAuth2 dance.
+
To return the token to get data, enter the following URL in a browser: +
`+http://localhost:8081/github+`
+
The GitHub API returns your user information.

=== OAuth 2 Authorization - Using Scopes

Configuring the Scopes attribute in the Mule client app is optional, and not needed for the GitHub example. To configure scopes, define a comma-separated list of OAuth scopes available in the authentication server. Scopes in OAuth are like security roles.

=== Send OAuth2 Custom Parameters to the Authorization URL

There are OAuth implementations that require or allow extra query parameters to be sent when calling the Authentication URL of the OAS.

=== OAuth 2 Custom Parameters - Studio Visual Editor

. In Studio, select the HTTP Request Configuration global element where you want to use the OAuth authorization code grant type.
. In *Authentication*, select *Authorization code grant type*. If this option is not visible, <<setpomfile,set the pom.xml file>> for OAuth options.
. Fill in the same fields as in the previous example:
+
** External Callback URL = `+http://myapp.mycompany.com:8082/callback+`
** Local Authorization URL = `+http://localhost:8082/login+`
** AuthorizationUrl = `+https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize+`
** client ID = Get the Client ID from your GitHub account
** client Secret = Get the Client Secret from your GitHub account
** Token URL = `+https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token+`
+
NOTE: The `Local Authorization URL` value matches the value you configured for `External callback URL` when registering the app in GitHub. This is the configuration of the server that Mule creates to receive the requests that a remote host sends to the `externalCallbackUrl`. External and internal callback URLs are the same, just that one is the configuration to create a server in the runtime (internal) and the other is how that server is seen from the internet (external).
+
. On `Custom Parameters` select `Edit inline`. Click the Plus (+) button as many times as you need and define a name and value for each custom parameter.

=== Override the Redirect URI

This section lets you override the redirect URI (external `redirect_uri`).

The https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749[OAuth 2.0 specification] describes checking the redirect URI from the destination site of the redirect. The OAuth authentication server uses the URL to provide the authentication code to the Mule server for retrieving the access token. If you provide this URL, Mule creates an endpoint at the URL for storing the authentication code unless there’s already an endpoint registered to manually extract the authorization code.

You configure the external redirect URI by setting the External Callback URL attribute (`externalCallbackUrl` in XML).

Using `externalCallbackUrl` is particularly useful for deploying applications to CloudHub, for example. When configuring authentication, you can optionally specify the `localCallbackUrl` attribute as well.

For example, the `localCallbackUrl` is `+http://localhost:8082/callback+` in the <<create-the-mule-client-app,previous example>>:

To create the endpoint for CloudHub, Mule has to create an endpoint for CloudHub in a different format. For example:

`+https://<app>.cloudhub.io/<redirect Uri>+`

To instruct Mule to create the endpoint for CloudHub in the correct format, include the `externalCallbackUrl` attribute in your `oauth:authorization-code-grant-type` configuration.

=== Extract Parameters from the Token URL Response

After you have obtained an authorization code from the authentication server, the OAuth dance makes a request to the Token URL of the server to receive an access token.

The format of the response to the request to the token URL is not defined in the OAuth spec. Each implementation may therefore return different response formats. By default, Mule expects the response to be in JSON format. When this is the case, HTTP Request knows how to extract the required information, as long as its elements are named as below:

* *Response access token*: The JSON field is named `access_token`
* *Response refresh token*: The JSON field is named `refresh_token`
* *Response expires in*: The JSON field is named `expires_in`

When the response is in JSON format, the parameters are automatically extracted and you can use xref:mule-runtime::dataweave.adoc[DataWeave expressions] to reference these values in the response to the request to the token URL, as shown in the previous GitHub example.

When the response is not in JSON format, then you must first configure the connector so that it knows how to extract these values. In the following example, the connector expects the response to have a `Content-Type` of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, so the body of the response is transformed into a Map in the payload. You extract the values from the map through DataWeave expressions, such as `#[payload.access_token]` (the default value for the *Response access token* and *Response refresh token*).

=== Refresh Access Token Customization

The access token you obtain from the token URL eventually expires. The length of time the token is valid depends on the authentication server implementation. After the access token expires, instead of going through the whole process once again, you can retrieve a new access token by using the *refresh access token* provided by the token URL response.

Mule handles this use case automatically. So by default, when an HTTP Request is executed, if the response has a status code of 403, Mule calls the token URL and gets a new access token.

You can customize when Mule performs one of these requests to obtain a new access token using a xref:mule-runtime::dataweave.adoc[DataWeave expression]. The expression is evaluated against the response of the HTTP Request call.

When a request authorization fails, the response contains an XML node named *status* with value `‘unauthorized’`. In the previous example, the DataWeave expression evaluates that condition. When it evaluates to true, Mule sends a request to the Token URL to retrieve a new access token.



=== Use HTTPS for OAuth Authorization Code

When you need to use HTTPS for the communication with the authentication server, such as in a production environment, apply HTTPS encoding to the OAuth credentials in all requests, including those for the:

* Local authorization URL
* Authorization URL
* Redirect URL
* Token URL

By specifying a TLS context in your HTTP Request Connector authentication settings, this is handled in all of these requests.

== Configure OAuth2 - Client Credentials

In the OAuth authentication, the Client Credentials tab lets you configure the client credentials grant type.

The OAuth authentication server (OAS) is a server that holds the resources that are protected by OAuth. For example, the Box server provides an API with OAuth authentication.

The client application (CA) is the server that tries to access a protected resource that belongs to a resource owner and that is held in an OAuth authentication server. For example, a Mule Server trying to access the resources that belong to a Box user and that are held in a Box server.

In this case, the resource owner (RO) is also the CA. This means that the CA is implicitly authorized by the RO, which makes the whole procedure a lot simpler.

image::oauth-danceposta-simple.png[]

To access protected resources:

. The CA must register an app to the OAS server. When this happens, the OAS assigns credentials to the CA that it can later use to identify itself: `client ID` and `client secret`. The OAS must also provide a `Token URL`, to which the CA can later send HTTP requests to retrieve an `access token` that is required when accessing the Protected Resources.
. The CA makes a request to the `Token URL` of the OAS, containing its client ID to prove its identity. As a response, the OAS grants it an `access token`.
. With this access token, the CA is now free to access the protected resources in the OAS as long as it includes it in its requests. Depending on the policies defined by the OAS, this token may eventually expire.

=== OAuth2 - Configuration

Client credentials grant type is meant to be used by a CA to grant access to an application on behalf of itself, rather than on behalf of a RO (resource owner) in the OAS. To get an access token all you need is the application credentials.

=== Token Manager - Access Authorization

After you have a token manager associated with the authorization grant type (in the example below, with authorization code) you can use the operations provided by the OAuth module anywhere in the flow to access information from an OAuth authorization.

If you're using *client credentials* or authorization code with a *single RO*, use the following operations in a a flow:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<oauth:retrieve-access-token
    tokenManager="tokenManagerConfig"/>

<oauth:retrieve-refresh-token
    tokenManager="tokenManagerConfig"/>

<oauth:retrieve-expires-in
    tokenManager="tokenManagerConfig"/>

<oauth:retrieve-state
    tokenManager="tokenManagerConfig"/>

<oauth:retrieve-custom-token-response-param
    tokenManager="tokenManagerConfig"
    key="#[vars.key]"/>
----

This operations provide access to the OAuth authorization information from a token manager.

* `tokenManager`: Name of a token manager in the configuration

If you're using authorization code with **multiple RO**, use the following operations:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<oauth:retrieve-access-token
    tokenManager="tokenManagerConfig"
    resourceOwnerId="#[vars.resourceOwnerId]"/>

<oauth:retrieve-refresh-token
    tokenManager="tokenManagerConfig"
    resourceOwnerId="#[vars.resourceOwnerId]"/>

<oauth:retrieve-expires-in
    tokenManager="tokenManagerConfig"
    resourceOwnerId="#[vars.resourceOwnerId]"/>

<oauth:retrieve-state
    tokenManager="tokenManagerConfig"
    resourceOwnerId="#[vars.resourceOwnerId]"/>

<oauth:retrieve-custom-token-response-param
    tokenManager="tokenManagerConfig"
    resourceOwnerId="#[vars.resourceOwnerId]"
    key="#[vars.key]"/>
----

This operations provide access to OAuth authorization information from a token manager.

* `tokenManager`: Name of a token manager in the configuration.
* `resourceOwnerId`: Identifier of a RO.

==== Token Manager - Examples

This table includes examples of how to retrieve information from a Token Manager. Use these operations in your flow that you place after the HTTP Request Connector that handles your OAuth authentication.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Function |Result
| `<oauth:retrieve-access-token tokenManager="tokenManagerConfig" target="accessToken"/>` | `accessToken` value accessible through `vars.accessToken` from DataWeave.
| `<oauth:retrieve-access-token tokenManager="tokenManagerConfig" resourceOwnerId="Perter" target="accessToken"/>` | `accessToken` value for the resource owner identified with the ID `Peter` accessible through `vars.accessToken` from DataWeave.
| `<oauth:retrieve-refresh-token tokenManager="tokenManagerConfig" target="refreshToken"/>` |`refreshToken` value accessible through `vars.refreshToken` from DataWeave.
| `<oauth:retrieve-expires-in tokenManager="tokenManagerConfig" target="expiresIn"/>` |Expires in value accessible through `vars.expiresIn` from DataWeave.

| `<oauth:retrieve-custom-token-response-param tokenManager="tokenManagerConfig" key="a_custom_param_name" target="customParam"/>` |Custom parameter extracted from the token URL response accessible through `vars.customParam` from DataWeave.
| `<oauth:retrieve-custom-token-response-param tokenManager="tokenManagerConfig" resourceOwnerId="Perter" key="a_custom_param_name" target="customParam"/>`
|Custom parameter extracted from the token URL response for resource owner `Peter` accessible through `vars.customParam` from DataWeave.

=== Token Manager - Access Token Invalidation

When using a Token Manager, you can block a particular resource owner.


=== Token Manager - Studio Visual Editor

. Drag an OAuth component's *Invalidate OAuth Context* operation to your canvas.
. In its properties editor, set up the *Token Manager Configuration* so that it points to the same *Token Manager* that your HTTP Request Connector references when handling OAuth authentication.
. Set the *Resource Owner Id* to an expression that points to the RO you want to clear. For example `#[vars.resourceOwnerId]`

=== Token Manager - XML Editor

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="invalidateOauthContext">
    <oauth:invalidate-oauth-context
      tokenManager="tokenManagerConfig"/>
</flow>
----

The *OAuth component's *Invalidate OAuth Context* operation cleans up all of the OAuth information stored in the token manager.

When using multiple RO with a single Token Manager, if you want to only clear the OAuth information of one RO, then you must specify the resource owner ID in the Invalidate OAuth Context element.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="invalidateOauthContextWithResourceOwnerId">
    <oauth:invalidate-oauth-context
           tokenManager="tokenManagerConfig"
           resourceOwnerId="#[vars.resourceOwnerId]"/>
</flow>
----

=== Token Manager - Customize the Token Manager Object Store

By default, the token manager uses an in-memory object store to store the credentials. You can customize the token manager object store by using the `objectStore` attribute. See also xref:object-store-connector::object-store-to-define-a-new-os.adoc[Configure a custom object store].

== Access Resources on Behalf of Several Users

When you need to access resources on behalf of several users, use SDK Connectors instead of using HTTP Connector in conjunction with the OAuth module.

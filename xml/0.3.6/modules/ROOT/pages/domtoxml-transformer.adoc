= DOM/XML Transformers
:keywords: transformers, xml, dom
:page-aliases: 3.6@mule-runtime::domtoxml-transformer.adoc

Mule contains several transformers that convert between a W3C DOM object and its serialized representation. The DomToXml transformer converts DOM objects to XML, the XmlToDom transformer converts XML strings to DOM objects, and the DomToOutputHandler transformer converts from a DOM to an OutputHandler serialization.

These transformers support the xref:3.6@mule-runtime::transformers-configuration-reference.adoc[standard transformer attributes]. In addition, they support the following configuration.

== XML Module

The XML module contains a number of tools to help you read, transform, and write XML.

=== Transformers

These are transformers specific to this transport. Note that these are added automatically to the Mule registry at start up. When doing automatic transformations these will be included when searching for the correct transformers.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Description
|dom-to-xml-transformer |Converts an XML payload (Document, XML stream, Source, etc.) to a serialized String representation.
|dom-to-output-handler-transformer |Converts an XML payload (Document, XML stream, Source, etc.) to an OutputHandler for efficient serialization.
|jxpath-extractor-transformer |The JXPathExtractor is a simple transformer that evaluates an XPath expression against the given bean and returns the result. By default, a single result will be returned. If multiple values are expected, set the `singleResult` property to `false`. In this case a `List` of values will be returned. Note the property is currently ignored for non-String/XML payloads.
|xpath-extractor-transformer |The XPathExtractor is a simple transformer that evaluates an XPath expression using the JAXP libraries against the given bean and returns the result. By default, a String of the result will be returned. To return a Node, NodeSet, Boolean or Number result, the `resultType` attribute can be set.
|object-to-xml-transformer |Converts a Java object to an XML representation using XStream.
|xml-to-dom-transformer |Transforms an XML message payload to an org.w3c.dom.Document.
|xml-to-object-transformer |Converts XML to Java bean graphs using XStream.
|jaxb-object-to-xml-transformer |Converts a Java object to an XML representation using XStream.
|jaxb-xml-to-object-transformer |Converts XML to Java bean graphs using XStream.
|xslt-transformer |The XSLT transformer uses XSLT to transform the message payload. Transformation objects are pooled for better performance. You can set transformation context properties on the transformer and can pull these properties from the message using Expression Evaluators.
|xquery-transformer |An Xml transformer uses XQuery to transform the message payload. Transformation objects are pooled for better performance. You can set transformation context properties on the transformer and can pull these properties from the message using Expression Evaluators.
|xml-prettyprinter-transformer |Formats an XML string using the Pretty Printer functionality in `org.dom4j.io.OutputFormat`.

=== Filters

Filters can be used to control which data is allowed to continue in the flow.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Description
|is-xml-filter |Accepts XML messages only. Alternatively, you can set the "not" attribute to filter out XML messages.
|jxpath-filter |Filters messages based on XPath expressions using JXPath.
|jaxen-filter |The Jaxen filter allows you to route messages based on XPath expressions. The Jaxen filter is generally faster than the JXPath filter and should be considered the first choice when using an XPath filter.
|xpath-filter |The XPath filter uses the JAXP libraries to filter XPath expressions. Available as of Mule 2.2.
|schema-validation-filter |The schema validation filter uses the JAXP libraries to validate your message against a schema. Available as of Mule 2.2.

|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|name |string |yes |  |The reference name of this context. Usually this will be referenced by a JAXB transformer
|packageNames |string |yes |  |A colon-separated list of packages where JAXB classes live

== Example

To use the DOM/XML transformers, you add them to your Mule XML configuration as follows:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<xm:dom-to-xml-transformer name="DomToXml"/>
<xm:xml-to-dom-transformer name="xmlToDom" returnClass="org.w3c.dom.Document" />
<xm:xml-to-output-handler-transformer name="xmlToOutputHandler" />
----

You can then reference them by name from endpoints:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<vm:inbound-endpoint name="testEndpoint" path="another.queue" connector-ref="vmConnector1" transformer-refs="DomToXml" />
...
<vm:outbound-endpoint ref="xml-dom-out" transformer-refs="xmlToDom" />
...
----

:page-aliases: 3.6@mule-runtime::xml-module-reference.adoc

The XML module contains several tools to help you read, transform, and write XML.

In addition to the functionality described on this page, you can also use the xref:3.6@mule-runtime::sxc-module-reference.adoc[SXC Module Reference], which enables efficient XPath XML routing.

== Supported XPath, XQuery and XSLT Versions

In 2013, the World Wide Web Consotium (http://www.w3.org[W3C]) published a new spec for version 3.0 of the XPath XQuery and XSLT standards. The new version of the standards is at "last call" status, and therefore highly unlikely to undergo major changes.

Mule 3.6.0 and later versions provide basic support for version 3.0 of the standards. "Basic support" means that any feature of the spec is supported as long as it doesn't rely on schema awareness, high order functions, or streaming.

Mule 3.6.0 and later versions also provide improved support for XPath 2.0, XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0.

=== Important Changes in Mule 3.6.0

The table below lists supported versions of the standards and their related components in Mule 3.6.0 and later versions.

== XML Formats

Mule understands a wide variety of XML Java representations:

* org.w3c.dom.Document, org.w3c.dom.Element
* org.dom4j.Document
* javax.xml.transform.Source
* InputStream, String, byte[]
* OutputHandler
* XMLStreamReader
* org.mule.module.xml.transformer.DelayedResult

Any transformer that accepts XML as an input will also understand these types.

== Transformers

There are several standard transformers that process XML inside Mule.

|===

=== Efficient Transformations with DelayedResult

Mule contains a special XML output format called DelayedResult. This format allows very efficient XML transformations by delaying any XML serialization until an OutputStream is available.

For example, here is an XSLT transformer set up to use DelayedResult:

If the result of this transformation were being sent to an HTTP client, the HTTP client would ask Mule for an OutputHandler and pass in the OutputStream to it. Only then would Mule perform the transformation, writing the output directly to the OutputStream.

If DelayedResult were not used, the XML result would first be written to an in-memory buffer before being written to the OutputStream. This will cause your XML processing to be slower.

== Filters

The XML module contains various XPath filters. For general details on how to use filters, see xref:3.6@mule-runtime::filters.adoc[Filters].

=== XPath Filter

[NOTE]
Mule 3.6.0 and later versions support XPath 3.0, which is backwards-compatible with XPath 2.0. On the other hand, XPath 1.0 is deprecated, and while simple expressions may work, some expressions may be incompatible. For details, see xref:xpath.adoc[XPath].

The XPath filter uses the JAXP libraries to filter XPath expressions.

The following configuration routes messages to the "vm://echo" endpoint when the value of "/e:purchaseOrder/e:shipTo/@country" is "US".

=== Schema Validation Filter

The schema validation filter uses the JAXP libraries to validate your message against a schema.

The following configuration will validate your message against a schema called `schema.xsd` and a schema called `anotherSchema.xsd`.

=== Jaxen Filter

_*Deprecated*_

[NOTE]
====
In Mule 3.6.0, the Jaxen filter has been deprecated, and is kept for backwards compatibility only. Instead, it is recommended to use the new function `xpath3`, which provides improved XPath support.

For a detailed description of the `xpath3` function, see xref:xpath.adoc[XPath].
====

The Jaxen filter uses the Jaxen library to filter messages based on XPath expressions.

The following configuration routes messages to the "vm://echo" endpoint when the value of "/e:purchaseOrder/e:shipTo/@country" is "US".

=== JXPath Filter

_*Deprecated*_

[NOTE]
====
In Mule 3.6.0, the JXPath filter has been deprecated, and is kept for backwards compatibility only. Instead, it is recommended to use the new function `xpath3`, which provides improved XPath support.

For a detailed description of the `xpath3` function, see xref:xpath.adoc[XPath].
====

The JXPath filter is very similar to the Jaxen filter. It is still used for historical purposes (it existed before the Jaxen filter).

== Splitters

The XML module contains two splitters, a filter-based splitter and a round-robin splitter.

== XML Parsers

In most cases, http://www.saxproject.org/about.html[SAX] is used to parse your XML. If you are using CXF or the XmlToXMLStreamReader, https://web.archive.org/web/20150526105309/http://stax.codehaus.org/Home[Stax] is used instead.

If you're using SAX, the SAX XML parser is determined by your JVM. If you want to change your SAX implementation, see http://www.saxproject.org/quickstart.html.

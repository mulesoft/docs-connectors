The XPath extractor transformer evaluates an XPath expression against the current message and returns the result using the JAXP libraries. By default, a string result of the XPath expression is returned. The transformer can be configured to return other types of results such as a Node, NodeSet, Boolean, or Number.

You configure the XPath transformer as follows:
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<xpath-extractor-transformer name="title" expression="/book/title" resultType="NODESET"/>
----

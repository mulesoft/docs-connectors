Support Category: https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#anypoint-connectors[Select]

Anypoint Connector for Email (Email Connector ) is used to list and send emails and perform operations in different mailboxes, such as `delete` and `mark as read`.

Email Connector supports the SMTP, SMTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, POP3, and POP3s protocols.

| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Active a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can be borrowed from a session at one time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of components that can be active at one time. When maxActive is exceeded, the pool is said to be exhausted. |  |
| Max Idle a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can sit idle in the pool at any time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of Mule components that can be idle at one time. |  |
| Max Wait a| Number | Specifies the number of milliseconds to wait for a pooled component to become available when the pool is exhausted and the exhaustedAction is set to `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT`. |  |
| Min Eviction Millis a| Number | Determines the minimum amount of time an object can sit idle in the pool before it is eligible for eviction. When the value is a negative number, no objects are evicted from the pool due to idle time alone. |  |
| Eviction Check Interval Millis a| Number | Specifies the number of milliseconds between runs of the object evictor. When this value is set to a negative number, no object evictor is executed. |  |
| Exhausted Action a| Enumeration, one of:

** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW
** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT
** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL | Specifies the behavior of the Mule component pool when the pool is exhausted. Possible values are: `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL`, which will throw a `NoSuchElementException`, `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT`, which will block by invoking `Object.wait(long)` until a new or idle object is available, or `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW`, which will create a new Mule instance and return it, essentially making `maxActive` meaningless. If a positive `maxWait` value is supplied, it will block for, at most, that many milliseconds, after which a `NoSuchElementException` is thrown. If `maxThreadWait` is a negative value, it blocks indefinitely. |  |
| Initialisation Policy a| Enumeration, one of:

** INITIALISE_NONE
** INITIALISE_ONE
** INITIALISE_ALL | Determines how components in a pool should be initialized. The possible values are: `INITIALISE_NONE` (loads no components into the pool on startup), `INITIALISE_ONE` (loads one initial component into the pool on startup), or `INITIALISE_ALL` (loads all components in the pool on startup) |  |
| Disabled a| Boolean | Whether pooling should be disabled |  |

= Trigger a Flow When Receiving a New Email Examples - Mule 4

The following examples illustrate how you configure the Anypoint Connector for Email (Email Connector) source listeners *On New Email - IMAP* and *On New Email - POP3* to identify and retrieve unread email messages, initiating a flow.

== Configure the Delete After Retrieve Parameter

Email Connector *On New Email - IMAP* and *On New Email - POP3* sources support the *Delete after retrieve* parameter that enables the deletion of retrieved emails from the mailbox folder after the operation process is complete. By deleting processed emails, you can ensure that the next processed emails are new ones. Because the POP3 protocol doesn't support watermarking, the *Delete after retrieve* parameter is commonly used with this protocol. +
The parameter is disabled by default to avoid deleting emails by mistake.

The following example shows how to configure this parameter in Anypoint Studio:

. Select the *On New Email - IMAP* or *On New Email - POP3* source in the Studio canvas.
. In the source configuration screen, enable the *Delete after retrieve* parameter.

The following screenshot shows the *Delete after retrieve* configuration for the *On New Email - IMAP* source:

.Delete after retrieve with On New Email - IMAP operation

In the XML editor, the configuration `deleteAfterRetrieve="true"` is under the `listener-imap` tag:
[source, xml, linenums]
----
<flow name="OnNewEmail-IMAP">
		<email:listener-imap config-ref="Email_IMAP" watermarkEnabled="false" deleteAfterRetrieve="true">
			<scheduling-strategy >
				<fixed-frequency />
			</scheduling-strategy>
		</email:listener-imap>
	</flow>
----

The following screenshot shows the *Delete after retrieve* configuration for the *On New Email - POP3* source:

.Delete after retrieve with On New Email - POP3 operation

In the XML editor, the configuration `deleteAfterRetrieve="true"` is under the `listener-pop3` tag:
[source, xml, linenums]
----
<flow name="OnNewEmail-POP3">
  <email:listener-pop3 config-ref="Email_POP3" deleteAfterRetrieve="true">
    <scheduling-strategy >
      <fixed-frequency />
    </scheduling-strategy>
  </email:listener-pop3>
</flow>
----


== Configure the Enable Watermark Parameter

Email Connector can watermark emails over the IMAP protocol by received date. The *On New Email - IMAP* source supports the *Enable Watermark* parameter, causing only those messages containing emails received after the last poll executed to be dispatched.

The following example shows how to configure this parameter in Anypoint Studio:

. Select the *On New Email - IMAP* source in the Studio canvas.
. On the source configuration screen, enable the *Enable Watermark* parameter.

The following screenshot shows this parameter configuration for the source:

.Enable Watermark with On New Email - IMAP source
image::email-watermark-1.png[Enable Watermark with On New Email - IMAP]

In the XML editor, the configuration `watermark="true"` is under the `listener-imap` tag:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<flow name="OnNewEmail-IMAP">
    <email:listener-imap config-ref="Email_IMAP" watermark="true">
        <scheduling-strategy>
            <fixed-frequency/>
        </scheduling-strategy>
    </email:listener-imap>
</flow>

== Configure the IMAP Matcher and POP3 Matcher Parameters

Email Connector *On New Email - IMAP* and *On New Email - POP3* sources support *Imap matcher* and *Pop3 matcher* parameters that enable you to configure custom matchers and thereby provide another way of filtering dispatched messages. Each source matcher can filter emails by dates, addresses, subject, flags, and so on.

The following example shows how to configure these parameters in Anypoint Studio by dispatching all messages that contain the word `IMPORTANT`:

. Select the *On New Email - IMAP* or *On New Email - POP3* source in the Studio canvas.
. On the source configuration screen, for the *Imap matcher* or *Pop3 matcher* parameters, select either:

* *Edit inline* +
Set all the inline fields *Seen*, *Answered*, *Deleted*, *Recent*, and so on.
* *Global reference* +
Create a global reference configuration to automatically set all the inline fields.

[start=3]
. Set the *Subject regex* field as `IMPORTANT`.

The following screenshot shows the *Imap matcher* edit inline configuration for the *On New Email - IMAP* source:

.Imap matcher with On New Email - IMAP source
image::email-imap-matcher.png[Imap matcher with On New Email - IMAP]

In the XML editor, the configuration `imap-matcher subjectRegex="IMPORTANT"` is under the `listener-imap` tag:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<flow name="OnNewEmail-IMAP">
    <email:listener-imap config-ref="Email_IMAP">
        <scheduling-strategy>
            <fixed-frequency/>
        </scheduling-strategy>
        <email:imap-matcher subjectRegex="IMPORTANT"/>
    </email:listener-imap>
</flow>

== Configure the Attachment Naming Strategy Parameter

Email Connector *On New Email - IMAP*, *On New Email - POP3*, *List - IMAP*, and *List - POP3* operations support the *Attachment naming strategy* parameter, which enables you to specify a strategy for naming attachments. You can set the parameter in a global element or override it at the operation level. The parameter has the following options:
* *NAME (Default)* +
Email Connector names the attachment after the value of the `filename` field in the `Content-Disposition` line of the attachment. If the `filename` field is not present or is empty, then the attachment is named `Unnamed`.
If multiple attachments have no name, they are called `Unnamed`, `Unnamed_1`, `Unnamed_2`, and so on.
* *NAME_HEADERS* +
Email Connector first tries to obtain the name from the `filename` field in the `Content-Disposition` line (the same as when using `NAME`). If that fails, the connector looks for the `name` header in the `Content-Type` line of the attachment. If the `name` header is not present or is empty, then the attachment is named `Unnamed`.
* *NAME_HEADERS_SUBJECT* +
If both *NAME_HEADERS* and *NAME_HEADERS_SUBJECT* fail, then the connector checks if the attachment itself is an email (a nested message) and looks for the subject of the email. If the subject is not empty, then the attachment is named after the subject. Otherwise, the attachment is named `Unnamed`.


The following example shows how to configure this parameter in the global element:

. In Studio, navigate to the *Global Element* view and click *Create* to open the *Choose Global Type* window.
. In the *Filter* box, type `email` and choose either *Email IMAP* or *Email POP3*, and click *OK*.
. In the *Global Element Properties* window, in the main *Advanced* tab, for the *Attachment naming strategy* field, select one of the following options:

* *NAME*
* *NAME_HEADERS*
* *NAME_HEADERS_SUBJECT*

. In the *General* tab, for *Connection* select any of the connection types to provide to the configuration.
. Specify the connection information for the connector, such as *Host*, *Port*, and *TLS configuration*.
. On the subsequent *Advanced* tab, optionally specify timeout configuration and reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *OK*.

The following screenshot shows the *Attachment naming strategy* configuration in the global element:

.Attachment naming strategy Global Element
image::email-attachment-1.png[Attachment naming strategy Global Element]

In the XML editor, the configuration `attachmentNamingStrategy="NAME"` is under the `imap-config` tag:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<email:imap-config name="gmail" attachmentNamingStrategy="NAME">
  <email:imap-connection host="imap.gmail.com" port="993" user="user@gmail.com" password="mypassword">
  </email:imap-connection>
</email:imap-config>
----

The following example shows how to override the naming strategy at the *On New Email - IMAP* source level:

. Select the *On New Email - IMAP* source in the Studio canvas.
. On the source configuration screen, in the *Advanced* tab, for the *Attachment naming strategy* field select one of the following options:

* *NAME*
* *NAME_HEADERS*
* *NAME_HEADERS_SUBJECT*

The following screenshot shows the *Attachment naming strategy* override at the *On New Email - IMAP level* source:

.Attachment naming strategy override source level
image::email-attachment-2.png[Attachment naming strategy override source level]

In the XML editor, the configuration `attachmentNamingStrategy="NAME"` is under the `listener-imap` tag:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<flow name="OnNewEmail-IMAP">
		<email:listener-imap  config-ref="Email_IMAP" attachmentNamingStrategy="NAME">
			<scheduling-strategy >
				<fixed-frequency />
			</scheduling-strategy>
		</email:listener-imap>
	</flow>

== Configure the Enable Remote Search for IMAP Matcher Parameter

When using the *On New Email - IMAP* source and *Imap matcher* parameter, you can specify whether you want the filters to be applied server-side by enabling the *Enable Remote Search* parameter.

This parameter is disabled by default because some email servers are not fully compliant with `rfc-3501` search terms. Enabling the parameter decreases traffic by reducing the number of emails sent to the client-side for processing.

For this feature to be fully functional, the email server should support the use of at least the basic filtering flags: *Answered*, *Deleted*, *Seen* and *Recent*.

The following example shows how to configure this parameter in Anypoint Studio by enabling server-side filtering to exclude all answered emails:

. Select the *On New Email - IMAP* source in the Studio canvas.
. In the source configuration screen, for the *Imap matcher*, select *Edit inline*.
. In the *Answered* field, select the value *EXCLUDE*.
. Enable the *Enable Remote Search* parameter.

The following screenshot shows the *Enable Remote Search* configuration for the *On New Email - IMAP* source:

.Enable Remote Search with On New Email - IMAP source
image::email-enableremote-1.png[Enable Remote Search with On New Email - IMAP]

In the XML editor, the configuration `remoteSearchFilterEnabled="true"` is under the `listener-imap` tag:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<email:listener-imap config-ref="gmail" remoteSearchFilterEnabled="true">
    <scheduling-strategy>
        <fixed-frequency/>
    </scheduling-strategy>
    <email:imap-matcher answered="EXCLUDE"/>
</email:listener-imap>

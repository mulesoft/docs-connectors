To use this connector, you must be familiar with:

* Anypoint Connectors
* Mule runtime engine (Mule)
* Elements and global elements in a Mule flow
* Creating a Mule app using Anypoint Studio (Studio)

Before creating an app, you must have access to Anypoint Platform and Anypoint Studio.


== Common Use Cases for the Connector

Email Connector enables you to:

* Retrieve emails from POP3 mailboxes
* Retrieve, delete, and store emails from IMAP mailboxes
* Send emails over the SMTP protocol
* Support secure connections for all protocols over Transport Layer Security (TLS)

For examples, see xref:email-examples.adoc[Examples].

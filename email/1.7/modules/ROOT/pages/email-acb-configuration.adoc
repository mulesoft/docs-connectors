Set connector-specific values for the following variables:

* {exchange-search-name} - Lower case term used to find the connector in Exchange. For example, redis.
* {connector-name} - Name of the connector without the word "Connector." For example, Redis.
* {version} - Connector version. For example, 1.0.
* {lc-connector-name} - Lower case connector name to use in the links in the Next Steps and See Also sections. For example, redis.
* {studio-connector-name} - Name of the connector as it appears in the Available modules section in the Studio Add Dependencies to Project window. For example, NetSuite Connector - Mule 4.

== Configuring the Trigger For the Flow

A trigger (source) initiates a flow when a specified condition is met.

You can configure one of these triggers to use with Email Connector:

* *On New Email - IMAP* +
//Initiates a flow by retrieving all the emails from an IMAP mailbox folder. Watermarking is supported with this protocol. This wording needs clarity. Ask dev.
* *On New Email - POP3* +
Initiates a flow by retrieving all the emails from an POP3 mailbox folder
* *HTTP > Listener* +
Initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port
* *Scheduler* +
Initiates a flow when a time-based condition is met
+
See xref:anypoint-code-builder::acb-component-scheduler.adoc[].

=== Configuring On New Email - POP3

To configure the *On New Email - POP3* trigger:

. Add the *On New Email - POP3* component to the canvas.
. Click the *On New Email - POP3* component on the canvas. 
. On the *General* tab, configure the following attributes:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Attribute | Description | Required
| Folder | Email folder that receives the sent email. | No
|Delete after retrieve a| If selected, retrieved emails are deleted after the operation completes. Deleting processed emails ensures that the next processed emails are new ones. The *Delete after retrieve* attribute is commonly used with the POP3 protocol because it doesn't support watermarking. | No
|Pop 3 matcher a| Custom matchers that enables filtering dispatched messages. Each source matcher can filter emails by dates, addresses, subject, flags, and so on. This attribute is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor, for example:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<flow name="OnNewEmail-POP3">
    <email:listener-pop3 config-ref="Email_POP3">
        <scheduling-strategy >
			<fixed-frequency frequency="1000" startDelay="0" timeUnit="MILLISECONDS"/>
		</scheduling-strategy>
        <email:pop3-matcher subjectRegex="IMPORTANT"/>
    </email:listener-pop3>
</flow>
----
| No
|Scheduling strategy a| Triggers the flow's execution based on a time-based condition. This field is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See <<scheduling-strategy>>. | Yes

=== Configuring On New Email - IMAP

To configure the *On New Email - IMAP* trigger:

. Add the *On New Email - IMAP* component to the canvas.
. Click the *On New Email - IMAP* component on the canvas. 
. On the *General* tab, configure the following attributes:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Attribute | Description | Required
| Folder | Email folder that receives the sent email. | No
|Delete after retrieve a| If selected, retrieved emails are deleted after the operation completes. Deleting processed emails ensures that the next processed emails are new ones. | No
| Enable Watermark | Watermark emails by received date so that only messages that contain emails received after the last poll executed are dispatched. | No
|Imap matcher | Custom matchers that enables filtering dispatched messages. Each source matcher can filter emails by dates, addresses, subject, flags, and so on. This attribute is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor, for example:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<flow name="OnNewEmail-IMAP">
    <email:listener-imap config-ref="Email_IMAP">
        <scheduling-strategy >
			<fixed-frequency frequency="1000" startDelay="0" timeUnit="MILLISECONDS"/>
		</scheduling-strategy>
        <email:imap-matcher subjectRegex="IMPORTANT"/>
    </email:listener-imap>
</flow>
---- | No
| Enable Remote Search | When used with the *Imap matcher* attribute, specifies whether you want to apply the filters server-side. | No
|Scheduling strategy a| Triggers the flow's execution based on a time-based condition. This field is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See <<scheduling-strategy>>. | Yes

== Connector Configurations

Email Connector configurations vary depending on the protocol you use. They share a basic set of parameters that require a connection over the protocols described in this documentation.

== TLS Configuration with Keystores and Truststores

You can use Transport Layer Security (TLS) and configure email by providing a key store with your certificate. You can also enable 2-way authentication by providing a trust store. For details, see xref:mule-runtime::tls-configuration.adoc[Configure TLS with Keystores and Truststores].

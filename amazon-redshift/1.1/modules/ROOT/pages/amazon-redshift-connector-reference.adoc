== Sources

[[Listener]]
== On Table Row
`<redshift:listener>`

Selects from a table at a regular interval and generates one message per row that is obtained. Optionally, watermark and ID columns can be provided. If a watermark column is provided, the values taken from that column will be used to filter the contents of the next poll, so that only rows with a greater watermark value are returned. If an ID column is provided, this component automatically ensures that the same row is not picked twice by concurrent polls.

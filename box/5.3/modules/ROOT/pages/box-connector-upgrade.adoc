== Upgrade Prerequisites

Before you perform the upgrade, you must create a backup of your files, data, and configurations in case you need to restore to them.

== Upgrade Steps

Follow these steps to perform the upgrade:

. In Anypoint Studio, create a Mule project.
. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Dependencies to Project*, enter `box` in the search field.
. In *Available modules*, select *Box Connector Config* and click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.
. Verify that the Box Connector dependency version is 5.0.0 in the `pom.xml` file in the Mule project.

Studio upgrades the connector automatically.

== Verify the Upgrade

After you install the latest version of the connector, follow these steps to verify the upgrade:

. In Studio, verify that there are no errors in the *Problems* or *Console* views.
. Verify that there are no problems in the project `pom.xml` file.

=== Revert the Upgrade

If it is necessary to revert to the previous version of box connector, change the `5.0.0` dependency version in the project's `pom.xml` file to the previous version.

You must update the project's `pom.xml` file in Anypoint Studio.

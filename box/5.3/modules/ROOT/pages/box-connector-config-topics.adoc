:page-aliases: connectors::box/box-connector-config-topics.adoc

To use Box Connector in a Mule app, configure a global Box configuration element to use by as many Box connectors as needed for your application.

== Configure the Box Connector Global Element

. Click the *Global Elements* tab at the base of the canvas.
. In the *Global Configuration Elements* screen, click *Create*.
. In the *Choose Global Type* wizard, expand Connector Configuration and select *Mule-box-connector Config* and click *OK*. +
In the configuration screen for `OAUTH 2.0` with Authorization Code, grant type displays. This is the only configuration that Box Connector supports.
. Configure the properties as described here.

In the `OAUTH 2.0` configuration screen, the placeholder values refer to a configuration file `mule-artifact.properties` placed in the
`src/main/resources` folder of your project.
+
You can either enter your credentials into the global configuration properties, or reference a configuration file that contains these values.
+
NOTE: Use a configuration file for simpler maintenance and better reusability of your project.
Keeping these values in a separate file is useful if you need to deploy to different environments where your access credentials are different, such as production, development, and QA.

. Click *OK*.

Box is an online file sharing and content management service for businesses. Anypoint Connector for Box (Box Connector) is a RAML-based connector that provides synchronization of data and automation of processes between Box
and third party CRMs, CMS, mobile, and social applications. Because this is a RAML-based connector, it only uses REST calls to interact with the Box 2.0 API and supports only a subset of available API services.

== Before You Begin

Before creating an app, you must have access to the Box target resource and Anypoint Platform.
You must also understand how to create a Mule app using Anypoint Studio.

You should be familiar with the use of the Box 2.0 API, Mule, Anypoint Connectors, Anypoint Studio, Mule concepts, elements in a Mule flow, and global elements.

To use this connector you need the following:

* A developer account or other valid Box instance.
* MuleSoft Enterprise License and necessary entitlements.

== Connection Types

Box Connector uses the following authentication types:

* JWT +
Server-side authentication using a keypair. For more information about configuring
Box Connector with JWT, refer to xref:box-connector-config-topics.adoc#jwt[JWT Authentication].

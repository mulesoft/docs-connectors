= Box Connector 4.0 - Mule 4

Support Category: https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#anypoint-connectors[Select]

Box is an online file sharing and content management service for businesses. The Anypoint Connector for Box is a RAML-based connector that provides synchronization of data and automation of processes between Box
and third party CRMs, CMS, mobile, and social applications. Because this is a RAML-based connector, it only uses REST calls to interact with the Box 2.0 API and supports only a subset of available API services.

You should be familiar with the use of the Box 2.0 API, Mule, Anypoint Connectors, Anypoint Studio, Mule concepts, elements in a Mule flow, and global elements.

To use this connector you need the following:

* A developer account or other valid Box instance.
* MuleSoft Enterprise License and necessary entitlements.

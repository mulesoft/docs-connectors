In the `OAUTH 2.0` configuration screen, the placeholder values refer to a configuration file `mule-artifact.properties` placed in the
`src/main/resources` folder of your project.
+
You can either enter your credentials into the global configuration properties, or reference a configuration file that contains these values.
+
NOTE: Use a configuration file for simpler maintenance and better reusability of your project.
Keeping these values in a separate file is useful if you need to deploy to different environments where your access credentials are different, such as production, development, and QA.

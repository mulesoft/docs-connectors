:page-aliases: connectors::redis/redis-connector-studio.adoc
:page-aliases: connectors::redis/redis-connector-design-center.adoc

Anypoint Studio (Studio) editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.

To add and configure a connector in Studio:

. <<create-mule-project,Create a Mule project>>.
. <<add-connector-to-project,Add the connector to your Mule project>>.
. <<configure-input-source,Configure an input source for the connector's flow>>.
. <<add-connector-operation,Add a connector operation to the flow>>.
. <<configure-global-element,Configure a global element for the connector>>.
. <<configure-other-fields,Configure the other connector fields>>.

When you run your app, you can view the app log as described in <<view-app-log,View the App Log>>.

If you are new to configuring connectors in Studio, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-config-use-studio.adoc[Use Studio to Configure a Connector]. If, after reading this topic, you need additional information about the connector fields, see the xref:redis-connector-reference.adoc[Redis Connector 5.3 Reference].

[[create-mule-project]]
== Create a Mule Project

In Studio, create a new Mule project in which to add and configure the connector:

. In Studio, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
. Enter a name for your Mule project and click *Finish*.

[[add-connector-to-project]]
== Add the Connector to Your Mule Project

Add Aynpoint Connector for Redis to your Mule project to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location and add the required dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Dependencies to Project*, type `redis` in the search field.
. Click *Redis Connector* in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.

[[configure-input-source]]
== Configure an Input Source

An input source initiates a flow when a specified condition is met.
You can configure one of these input sources to use with Redis Connector:

* *Subscribe* +
Enables the Mule app to listen to specified channels
* *HTTP Listener* +
Initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port
* *Scheduler* +
Initiates a flow when a time-based condition is met

For example, to configure the *Subscribe* input source, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *Redis > Subscribe*.
. Drag *Subscribe* to the Studio canvas.
. On the *Subscribe* configuration screen, optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. In *Channels* provide a list of Redis channel names or globbing patterns.


[[add-connector-operation]]
== Add a Connector Operation to the Flow

When you add a connector operation to your flow, you immediately define a specific operation for that connector to perform.

To add an operation for Redis Connector, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *Redis* and then select the desired operation.
. Drag the operation onto the Studio canvas to the right of the input source.

[[configure-global-element]]
== Configure a Global Element for the Connector

When you configure a connector, it’s best to configure a global element that all instances of that connector in the app can use. Configuring a global element requires you to provide the authentication credentials the connector uses to access the target Redis system. Redis Connector supports global elements for clustered Redis configurations and nonclustered Redis configurations.

. Select the operation in the Studio canvas.
. In the configuration screen for the operation, click the plus sign (+) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of Redis Connector in the app.
+
When you configure a global element, you can reference a configuration file that contains ANT-style property placeholders (recommended), or you can enter your authorization credentials in the global configuration properties. For information about the benefits of using property placeholders and how to configure them, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-connector-configuration-overview.adoc[Anypoint Connector Configuration].

. On the *Connection* tab, select the connection type:
* *<<clustered-config,Clustered>>*
* *<<nonclustered-config,NonClustered>>*
* *<<sentinel-config,Sentinel>>*
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

[[clustered-config]]
=== Clustered Redis Configuration

Enter the following information on the *General* tab of the *Global Element Properties* screen to configure a Clustered connection:

image::redis-basic-config-clustered.png[Configuration fields for Redis clustered connection type]

. In *Name*, enter a name for the configuration.
. In *Connection*, select *Clustered* to use the connector with a clustered Redis configuration.
. Enter values for the following fields:
* *Cluster hosts* +
Comma-separated list for all Redis cluster hosts using the format `host:port`
* *Connection timeout* +
Optional connection timeout value, in milliseconds
* *Entry Ttl*
Optional default time-to-live value to set on keys stored through the connector
*Password* +
Redis password for server authentication
. Click *Test Connection*.
. Click *OK*.

[[nonclustered-config]]
=== Nonclustered Redis Configuration

Enter the following information on the *General* tab of the *Global Element Properties* screen to configure a nonclustered connection:

image::redis-basic-config.png[Configuration fields for Redis nonclustered connection type]

. In *Name*, enter a name for the configuration.
. In *Connection*, select *NonClustered* to use the connector with a nonclustered Redis configuration.
. Enter values for the following fields:
* *Host* +
Host for the Redis server
* *Port* +
Port on which the nonclustered server is running
*Connection Timeout* +
Optional connection timeout value, in milliseconds
* *Entry Ttl* +
Optional default time-to-live value to set on keys stored through the connector.
* *Password* +
Password for server authentication.
. Click *Test Connection*.
. Click *OK*.


[[sentinel-config]]
== Sentinel Configuration

Sentinel provides a high-availability solution in case of failure on your Redis cluster.

To configure a Sentinel connection:

. On the *General* tab of the *Global Element Properties*, enter a name for the configuration.
. In *Connection*, select *Sentinel* to use the connector with a nonclustered Redis configuration.
. Enter values for the following fields:
* *Sentinels hosts* +
Sentinel addresses that monitor the Redis master host to which the connector will connect
* *Master name* +
Name of the Redis master for which Sentinel discovers and returns the address of the master instance to connect to
* *Sentinel password* +
Password for Sentinel server authentication
* *Index* +
Index of the database that the pool uses
* *Password* +
Password for Redis server authentication
* *Entry ttl* +
Optional default time-to-live value to set on keys stored through the connector
. Click *Test Connection*.
. Click *OK*.

[[configure-tls]]
=== TLS Configuration

To enable and configure TLS for your app:

. In the *Connection* section for the configuration, click the *Security* tab.
. To configure a truststore, in *TLS Configuration*, select *Edit inline* and provide the following values:
* *Path* +
Location of the truststore file.
* *Password* +
Password for the truststore file.
* *Type* +
File format of the truststore file.
* *Algorithm* +
Algorithm the truststore uses.
* *Insecure* +
Boolean that determines whether or not to validate the truststore. If set to `true`, no validation occurs. The default value is `false`.
. To configure a keystore, enter the following values:
* *Type* +
Optionally specify the file format of the keystore file. The default value is `JKS`.
* *Path* +
Optionally specify the location of the keystore file. This can be used for two-way authentication for the connector.
* *Alias* +
Attribute that indicates the alias of the key to use when the keystore contains many private keys. If not defined, the first key in the file is used by default.
* *Key password* +
Key manager password, which is the password for the private key inside the keystore.
* *Password* +
Store password for the keystore file. This is required only if the *Key Store Location* is configured.
** *Algorithm* +
Algorithm used in the keystore.
. Click *Test Connection*.
. Click *OK*.

[[view-app-log]]
== View the App Log

You can view the app log for the connector as follows:

* If you’re running the app from the Anypoint Platform, the output is visible in the Anypoint Studio *Console* window.
* If you’re running the app using Mule from the command line, the app log is visible in your OS console.

Unless the log file path was customized in the app’s log file (`log4j2.xml`), you can also view the app log in
`MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`.

For more information about the app log, see xref:mule-runtime::logging-in-mule.adoc[Configuring Logging].

== Next Step

After you configure a global element and connection information, configure the other fields for the connector.

= Redis - Studio - Mule 4

To configure a connector in Anypoint Studio:

. Install the connector from either Anypoint Exchange or from within Anypoint Studio.
. Configure the connector.
. Configure an input source for the connector.

== Install the Connector Using Exchange

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. Click the Exchange *(X)* icon in the upper left of the Studio task bar.
. In Exchange, click *Login* and supply your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. In Exchange, search for `Redis`.
. Select the Redis Connector, click *Add to project*.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

== Install the Connector in Studio

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. In the Mule Palette, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Modules to Project*, type `Redis` in the search field.
. Click the Redis Connector name in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.


== Configure the Connector

To use Redis connector in your Mule app, configure a global Redis element that can be used by all
instances of the Redis Connector in your app.

The sections that follow provide the properties to configure the global element.

== Non-Cluster Configuration

In this image, the placeholder values refer to a configuration file placed in the `src` folder of your project. You can either code your credentials into the global configuration properties, or reference a configuration file that contains these values. For simpler maintenance and better reusability of your project, Mule recommends that you use a configuration file. Keeping these values in a separate file is useful if you need to deploy to different environments, such as production, development, and QA, where your access credentials differ.

[%header,cols="25s,75a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|Name | Enter a name for this configuration to reference it later.
|Host| Redis host. Use this field when you want to access a Redis server that is not part of a cluster through the connector.
|Port| Redis port. The port on which a non-cluster server is running.
|Connection Timeout| Connection timeout in milliseconds.
|Entry Ttl| The default time to live to be set on keys stored through the connector.
|Password| Redis password. Set this in case that the server requires authentication.

== Cluster Configuration

[%header,cols="25s,75a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|Name | Enter a name for this configuration to reference it later.
|Cluster Hosts| Redis cluster hosts, separated by commas and with the format host:port. Use this field when you want to access a Redis cluster through the connector.
|Connection Timeout| Connection timeout in milliseconds.
|Entry Ttl| The default time to live to be set on keys stored through the connector.
|===

== Configure an Input Source

Configure an input source for the connector such as a connector operation, using an *HTTP Listener*, or *Scheduler*.

Redis provides the *Subscribe* operation for use as an input source.

`<redis:subscribe>`

[%header,cols="20s,20a,30a,20a,10a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Configuration | String | The name of the configuration to use. | | x
| Channels a| Array of String |  A list of channel names or globbing patterns. |  | x
| Output Mime Type a| String |  The MIME type of the payload that this operation outputs. |  |
| Primary Node Only a| Boolean |  Whether this source should only be executed on the primary node when running in  a cluster. |  |
| Streaming Strategy a| * repeatable-in-memory-stream
* repeatable-file-store-stream
* non-repeatable-stream |  Configure to use repeatable streams. |  |
| Redelivery Policy a| RedeliveryPolicy |  Defines a policy for processing the redelivery of the same message. |  |
| Reconnection Strategy a| * reconnect
* reconnect-forever |  A retry strategy in case of connectivity errors. |  |

= Redis Design Center Configuration - Mule 4

Design Center enables you to create apps visually. To use Design Center, work with your Anypoint Platform administrator to ensure that you have a xref:access-management::environments.adoc#to-create-a-new-environment[Design environment]. For more information, see the xref:design-center::fd-tour.adoc[Flow Designer Tour].

To create an app in Design Center:

* Configure the input source (trigger) for your app.
* Add the connector as a component to process the input for the app.

For information on Design Center field values, see the xref:redis-connector-reference.adoc[Redis Connector Reference].

== Configure the Trigger

. In Design Center, click *Create*.
. Click *Create new application*.
. Specify a value for *Project name*.
. Exit from *Let's get started* by clicking *Go straight to canvas*.
. Click the name of the trigger card.
. If you are using the Redis connector as an input source trigger, search for the connector; otherwise, search for HTTP or Scheduler. Redis Connector provides the *Subscribe* input source trigger that enables your app to subscribe to Redis.
. Complete the fields with the values you want to configure for your trigger.

The Redis connector provides the *Subscribe* operation as a trigger. This enables you
to subscribe to a channel for publish and subscribe message queue functionality.

== Configure the Target Component

. Click *+* next to the trigger card.
. In *Select a component*, search for the connector name.
. Select the connector name.
. Select an operation for the connector.
. Enter the required values in the *General* tab.
. If needed, enter values for other tabs.
. Specify access information to the connector resource.
. If a *Test* button is available, click it to test the connection.

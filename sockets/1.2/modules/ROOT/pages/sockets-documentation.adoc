== Configurations
---
[[listener-config]]
=== Listener Config

+++
Implementation of AbstractSocketConfig for listener sockets.
+++

==== Parameters

[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%,.^20%,^.^5%", options="header"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name of this configuration. With this name can be later referenced. | | *x*{nbsp}
| Connection a| * <<listener-config_tcp-listener, TCP Listener>> {nbsp}
* <<listener-config_udp-listener, UDP Listener>> {nbsp}
 | The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | | *x*{nbsp}
| Default Encoding a| String |  +++Default encoding used for serializing String. This encoding is used in the
SocketOperations#send(RequesterConnection, RequesterConfig, Object, String, String, Message) operation for
serializing String types if no encoding parameter is specified.
It is also used by the SocketWorker for encoding the replies send by the SocketListener source.+++ |  | {nbsp}
|===

==== Connection Types

[[listener-config_tcp-listener]]
===== TCP Listener

+++
A ConnectionProvider which provides instances of TcpListenerConnection to be used by SocketListener.
+++

====== Parameters

[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%,.^20%,^.^5%", options="header"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Protocol a| One of:

* <<SafeProtocol>>
* <<DirectProtocol>>
* <<LengthProtocol>>
* <<StreamingProtocol>>
* <<XmlMessageProtocol>>
* <<xml-message-eof-protocol>>
* <<CustomProtocol>>
* <<eof-protocol>>
* <<CustomClassLoadingLengthProtocol>> |  +++TcpProtocol that knows how the data is going to be read and written. If not specified, the SafeProtocol will be used.+++ |  | {nbsp}
| TLS Configuration a| <<Tls>> |  +++Its presence will imply the use of SSLServerSocket instead of plain TCP ServerSocket for accepting new SSL connections.+++ |  | {nbsp}
| Port a| Number |  +++Connection's port number+++ |  | *x*{nbsp}
| Host a| String |  +++Connection's host name+++ |  | *x*{nbsp}
| Reconnection Strategy a| * <<reconnect>>
* <<reconnect-forever>> |  +++A retry strategy in case of connectivity errors+++ |  | {nbsp}
| Disable Validation a| Boolean |  +++Disables connection validation+++ |  | {nbsp}
| Send Buffer Size a| Number |  +++The size of the buffer (in bytes) used when sending data, set on the socket itself.+++ |  | {nbsp}
| Receive Buffer Size a| Number |  +++The size of the buffer (in bytes) used when receiving data, set on the socket itself.+++ |  | {nbsp}
| Client Timeout a| Number |  +++This sets the SO_TIMEOUT value on sockets. Indicates the amount of time (in milliseconds) that the socket will wait in a blocking operation before failing. A value of 0 (the default) means waiting indefinitely.+++ |  | {nbsp}
| Reuse Address a| Boolean |  +++If set (the default), SO_REUSEADDRESS is set on the sockets before binding. This helps reduce "address already in use" errors when a socket is re-used.+++ |  +++true+++ | {nbsp}
| Send TCP With No Delay a| Boolean |  +++If set, transmitted data is not collected together for greater efficiency but sent immediately. Defaults to true even though Socket default is false because optimizing to reduce amount of network traffic
over latency is hardly ever a concern today.+++ |  +++true+++ | {nbsp}
| Linger a| Number |  +++This sets the SO_LINGER value. This is related to how long (in milliseconds) the socket will take to close so that any remaining data is transmitted correctly.+++ |  | {nbsp}
| Keep Alive a| Boolean |  +++Enables SO_KEEPALIVE behavior on open sockets. This automatically checks socket connections that are open but unused for long periods and closes them if the connection becomes unavailable. This is a property on the socket itself and is used by a server socket to control whether connections to the server are kept
alive before they are recycled.+++ |  +++false+++ | {nbsp}
| Fail On Unresolved Host a| Boolean |  +++Whether the socket should fail during its creation if the host set on the endpoint cannot be resolved. However, it can be set to false to allow unresolved hosts (useful when connecting through a proxy).+++ |  +++true+++ | {nbsp}
| Server Timeout a| Number |  +++This sets the SO_TIMEOUT value when the socket is used as a server. This is the timeout that applies to the "accept" operation. A value of 0 (the ServerSocket default) causes the accept to wait indefinitely (if no connection arrives).+++ |  | {nbsp}
| Receive Backlog a| Number |  +++The maximum queue length for incoming connections.+++ |  +++50+++ | {nbsp}
|===

[[listener-config]]
=== Listener Config


Config for listener sockets


==== Parameters
[%header,cols="20s,20a,35a,20a,5a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x
| Connection a| * <<listener-config_tcp-listener, Tcp Listener>>
* <<listener-config_udp-listener, Udp Listener>>
 | The connection types to provide to this configuration. | | x
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before Mule considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform expires the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. Mule purges the instances as appropriate. |  |
|===

==== Connection Types
[[listener-config_tcp-listener]]
===== Tcp Listener


A ConnectionProvider which provides instances of TcpListenerConnection to use by SocketListener


====== Parameters
[%header,cols="20s,20a,35a,20a,5a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Protocol a| One of:

* <<SafeProtocol>>
* <<DirectProtocol>>
* <<LengthProtocol>>
* <<StreamingProtocol>>
* <<XmlMessageProtocol>>
* <<xml-message-eof-protocol>>
* <<CustomProtocol>>
* <<eof-protocol>>
* <<CustomClassLoadingLengthProtocol>> |  TcpProtocol that knows how the data is read and written. If not specified, uses SafeProtocol. |  |
| TLS Configuration a| <<Tls>> |  Implies the use of SSLServerSocket instead of plain TCP ServerSocket for accepting new SSL connections. |  |
| Port a| Number |  Connection's port number |  | x
| Host a| String |  Connection's host name |  | x
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to true, deployment fails if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy. |  |
| Send Buffer Size a| Number |  The size of the buffer (in bytes) used when sending data, set on the socket itself. |  |
| Receive Buffer Size a| Number |  The size of the buffer (in bytes) used when receiving data, set on the socket itself. |  |
| Client Timeout a| Number |  Sets the SO_TIMEOUT value on sockets, and indicates the amount of time (in milliseconds) that the socket waits in a blocking operation before failing. A value of 0 (default) indicates waiting indefinitely. |  |
| Reuse Address a| Boolean |  Sets SO_REUSEADDRESS (default) value on the sockets before binding, which helps reduce "address already in use" errors when a socket is reused. |  true |
| Send TCP With No Delay a| Boolean |  If set, it does not collect transmitted data together for greater efficiency but sends it immediately. Defaults to true even though socket default is false, because optimizing to reduce amount of network traffic
over latency is hardly ever a concern today. |  true |
| Linger a| Number |  Sets SO_LINGER value, and indicates how long (in milliseconds) the socket takes to close, so any remaining data transmits correctly. |  |
| Keep Alive a| Boolean |  Enables SO_KEEPALIVE behavior on open sockets. This automatically checks open socket connections but unused for long periods and closes them if the connection becomes unavailable. This is a property on the socket itself and a server socket uses it to control whether connections to the server keep alive before they recycle. |  false |
| Fail On Unresolved Host a| Boolean |  Whether the socket fails during its creation if the host set on the endpoint cannot be resolved. However, set it to false to allow unresolved hosts, which is useful when connecting through a proxy. |  true |
| Server Timeout a| Number |  Sets SO_TIMEOUT value when you use the socket as a server. The timeout that applies to the "accept" operation. If no connection arrives, a value of 0 (default) causes the accept to wait indefinitely. |  |
| Receive Backlog a| Number |  The maximum queue length for incoming connections. |  50 |

[[SafeProtocol]]

| Rethrow Exception On Read a| Boolean | Indicates if the exception should be rethrown if there is a failure while reading | false |
|===

[[DirectProtocol]]
=== Direct Protocol

This protocol allows the socket to read until no more bytes are immediately available. On slow networks, `EOFProtocol` and `LengthProtocol` might be more reliable.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Rethrow Exception On Read a| Boolean | Indicates if the exception should be rethrown if there is a failure while reading | false |
|===

[[LengthProtocol]]

This protocol is defined by sending or reading an integer (the packet length) and then the data to transfer.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Message Length a| Number | Indicates the maximum length of the message. | -1 |
| Rethrow Exception On Read a| Boolean | Indicates if the exception should be rethrown if there is a failure while reading | false |
|===

[[StreamingProtocol]]
=== Streaming Protocol

This protocol allows the socket’s Send operation to return a message with the original InputStream as payload.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Rethrow Exception On Read a| Boolean | Indicates if the exception should be rethrown if there is a failure while reading | false |
|===

[[XmlMessageProtocol]]
=== XML Message Protocol

This protocol reads streaming XML documents. The only requirement is that each document includes an XML declaration at the beginning of the document in the form of `<?xml…​.`.
Data is read until a new document is found or until there is no more currently available data. For slower networks, `XmlMessageEofProtocol` might be more reliable.
Also, because the default character encoding for Anypoint Platform is used to decode the message bytes when looking for the XML declaration, some caution with message character encodings is warranted.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Rethrow Exception On Read a| Boolean | Indicates if the exception should be rethrown if there is a failure while reading | false |
|===

|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Rethrow Exception On Read a| Boolean | Indicates if the exception should be rethrown if there is a failure while reading | false |

|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Class a| String | Reference to full qualifier class name that should extend TcpProtocol to use as a custom protocol |  | x
|===

[[eof-protocol]]
=== Eof Protocol

When clients connect to a server using the EOF protocol, they write the message on the socket connection output stream. To signal the end of the message, clients must signal the end of file (EOF) by closing the output stream and keeping the input stream open, waiting for a response from the server. This behavior is known as half-close. Then, the server sends a response and closes its output stream and the whole socket connection.

For TLS secured connections, use TLS 1.3 and JDK 11 as the half-close feature is not supported in TLS 1.2 and earlier versions. The half-close feature triggers the close notification alert to prevent TLS truncation attacks. JDK 11 and newer versions support TLS 1.3. Also, pooling profile is not compatible with `EofProtocol`.

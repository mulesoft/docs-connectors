== MongoDB Version 4.x Versus Previous Versions

[%header,cols="34a,33a,33a"]
|===
|  |MongoDB Connector 4.x |Previous versions
|*Global Configuration*

|* *Configuration*: This configuration requires the following credentials: username, password, database, and host. Remember that we *no longer support the port field*. Now you have to provide *"host:port"* inside the host field of your `mongo:config` element.
* *Advance*: Apart from what is available in the above configuration, you can now set a list of comma-separated servers in your host field.

The previous version of the connector requires the following credentials: username,
password, database, host, and port.

|*Mongo DataTypes*


|* *Write Concern* and *Write Result* do not exist anymore.
* No *Write Concern* can be set and your operations only return Strings,
Documents, and DBObjects.

|* In the previous version of the connector, you had to set the *Write Concern* parameter.
* Some operations return a *Write Result* object with the status of the operation.

|*Payload Manipulation* |Use of DataWeave is encouraged to manipulate the payload for input and to process the response. The connector picks the input request from the flow payload, and it only accepts payloads of JSON type. |Previous versions of the connector enable the user to create the request using the DataMapper, the Java Component, or the Groovy Component.

=== New Operation Names

* With the driver update, we also updated the operation names to suit driver changes.

|Mongo 3.x Operation| Mongo 4.x Operation
|Count objects |Count documents
|End consistent request |This operation has been deleted
|Find one object |Find one document
|Insert object |Insert document
|Remove object |Remove document
|Save object |Save document
|Start consistent request |This operation has been deleted
|Update objects |Update documents
|Update objects by function |Update documents by function
|"XX using query map" |All these operations have been deleted.
You now use DataWeave to create a query.

=== Updating From an Older Version

. Uninstall the previous MongoDB Connector.
. In Anypoint Studio, click *Help* > *Install New Software*. In the *Works with* drop-down menu,
click `Anypoint Connectors Update Site`.
. Expand the *Select* category and click *Mongo DB Connector* version 4.x (x is the latest version number).
. Ensure that the Maven dependencies have been updated correctly from *Mongo DB[v3.X.X]* to *Mongo DB[v4.0.2]* (or the latest version).
. Update flows that are using *Phased Out* or *Deprecated operations*.
.. Most operation names have been changed to comply with Mongo Driver v3, so if you had an *InsertObject* operation, now it appears as *InsertDocument*.
.. WriteResult objects have been removed. Now your operations only return Strings, Documents and DBObjects.
.. MongoDB *transformers*  have been replaced by implicit ones. So, if your input data is a **Map** and, you want to perform an Insert operation, just drag a MongoDB connector into the workspace, choose the **InsertDocument** operation and you're done! You no longer require the use of the transformer.
.. Remember that `mongo:config` does *NOT* support the *port* field anymore. Now you have to specify the port inside the *host* field of your `mongo:config` using the format *"host:port"*.


== Post Installation

The following sections describe how to complete an installation from either Maven or non-Maven projects.

=== Maven-Based Project

. Open the project's pom.xml file and delete any references to the older version.  The artifact-id of the previous versions follow this format: `mule-module-mongo`
. Add the MongoDB connector reference by setting the version property to `4.0.2` (or the latest version).
. Save your pom.xml file changes.

You may need to manually update the project dependencies.

=== Non-Maven Based Project

* Locate the MongoDB connector library, right-click the library, and click *Build Path* > *Remove from Build Path*.
* To import the MongoDB connector v4.0.2 library, right-click the project, click *Build Path* > *Add Libraries* > *Anypoint Connectors Dependencies*, and locate *Mongo DB v4.0.2*.

After following the steps above, update your flows by replacing the MongoDB Connector with the newer version and its data mappings.

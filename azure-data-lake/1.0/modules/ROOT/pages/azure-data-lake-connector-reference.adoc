[cols=".^20%,.^25%,.^30%,.^15%,.^10%", options="header"]
|======================
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Idle Time a| Number | A scalar time value for the maximum amount of time a dynamic configuration instance should be allowed to be idle before it's considered eligible for expiration |  | 
| Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS | A time unit that qualifies the maxIdleTime attribute |  |

[[HttpResponseAttributes]]
=== HTTP Response Attributes

[cols=".^20%,.^25%,.^30%,.^15%,.^10%", options="header"]
|======================
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Status Code a| Number |  |  | x
| Headers a| Object |  |  | x
| Reason Phrase a| String |  |  | x
|======================

[[RepeatableInMemoryStream]]
=== Repeatable In-Memory Stream

When streaming in this mode, Mule does not use the disk to buffer the contents. If you exceed the buffer size, the message fails.

[cols=".^20%,.^25%,.^30%,.^15%,.^10%", options="header"]
|======================
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | This is the amount of memory to allocate to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than what can fit into this buffer, then it expands according to the bufferSizeIncrement attribute, with an upper limit of maxInMemorySize. |  | 
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This specifies the increment for how much the buffer size will expand if it exceeds its initial specified size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer should not expand, and a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error is raised when the buffer gets full. |  | 
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | This is the maximum amount of memory to use. If more than that is used then a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised. A value lower or equal to zero means no limit. |  | 
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which all these attributes are expressed |  | 
|======================

[[RepeatableFileStoreStream]]
=== Repeatable File Store Stream

File store repeatable streams require buffering, and there are different buffering strategies. Mule keeps a portion of contents in memory. If the stream contents are larger than the configured buffer size, Mule backs up the buffer’s content to disk and then clears the memory.

[cols=".^20%,.^25%,.^30%,.^15%,.^10%", options="header"]
|======================
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| In Memory Size a| Number | Defines the maximum memory that the stream should use to keep data in memory. If more than that is consumed then it will start to buffer the content on disk. |  | 
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which maxInMemorySize is expressed |  | 
|======================

[non-repeatable-stream] 
=== Non-Repeatable Stream

Disables the repeatable stream functionality and use non-repeatable streams to have less performance overhead, memory use, and cost.

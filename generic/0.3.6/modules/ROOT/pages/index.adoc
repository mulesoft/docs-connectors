= Generic Connector
:keywords: anypoint studio, connectors, generic connector
:page-aliases: 3.6@mule-runtime::generic-connector.adoc

The Generic connector allows for a wide array of configuration options by allowing the user to code the protocol into the address of the endpoint.

Mule supports numerous protocols which can be configured as endpoints. Many, but not all, of the protocols included with Mule are already configured as endpoint-based connectors and are available as building blocks in the connectors category of the palette. These include FTP, HTTP, and Ajax, for example. The Generic Endpoint can also be used to specify these or additional endpoints. This is done by entering the full address in *Address* field, including the protocol designation within the address.

== Installation

You can install a connector in Anypoint Studio using the instructions in xref:3.6@mule-runtime::installing-connectors.adoc[To Install a Connector from Anypoint Exchange].

== Configuration Reference - Inbound Endpoint

An inbound endpoint receives messages via the associated transport. As with global endpoints, each transport implements its own inbound endpoint element.

=== Attributes of <inbound-endpoint...>


[%header,cols="5*"]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|name |name (no spaces) |no | | Identifies the endpoint in the registry. There is no need to set the 'name' attribute on inbound or outbound endpoints, only on global endpoints.
|ref |string |no | |A reference to a global endpoint, which is used as a template to construct this endpoint. A template fixes the address (protocol, path, host, etc.), and may specify initial values for various properties, but further properties can be defined locally (as long as they do not change the address in any way).
|address |string |no | |The generic address for this endpoint. If this attribute is used, the protocol must be specified as part of the URI. Alternatively, most transports provide their own attributes for specifying the address (path, host, etc.). Note that the address attribute cannot be combined with 'ref' or with the transport-provided alternative attributes.
|responseTimeout |integer |no | |The timeout for a response if making a synchronous endpoint call
|encoding |string |no | |String encoding used for messages.
|connector-ref |string |no | |The name of the connector associated with this endpoint. This must be specified if more than one connector is defined for this transport.
|transformer-refs |list of names |no | |A list of the transformers that will be applied (in order) to the message before it is delivered to the component.
|responseTransformer-refs |list of names |no | |A list of the transformers that will be applied (in order) to the synchronous response before it is returned via the transport.
|disableTransportTransformer |boolean |no | |Don't use the default inbound/outbound/response transformer which corresponds to this endpoint's transport, if any.
|mime type |string |no  | |The mime type, e.g. text/plain or application/json |exchange-pattern |enumeration |no | |

|abstract-reconnection-strategy |0..1 |A placeholder for a reconnection strategy element. Reconnection strategies define how Mule should attempt to handle a connection failure.
|abstract-multi-transaction |0..1 |A placeholder for multi-transaction elements. Multi-transactions allow a series of operations to be grouped together spanning different transports, e.g. JMS and JDBC, but without the overhead of XA. The trade-off is that XA reliability guarantees aren't available, and services must be ready to handle duplicates. This is very similar to a 1.5 PC concept. EE-only feature.

== Global Configuration Reference

In XML only, you can also define a global generic endpoint and reference it from specific endpoints within your flows.

== Endpoint

A global endpoint, which acts as a template that can be used to construct an inbound or outbound endpoint elsewhere in the configuration by referencing the global endpoint name. Each transport implements its own endpoint element, with a more friendly syntax, but this generic element can be used with any transport by supplying the correct address URI. For example, "vm://foo" describes a VM transport endpoint.

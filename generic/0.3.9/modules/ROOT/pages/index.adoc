= Generic Connector
:keywords: anypoint studio, connectors, generic connector
:page-aliases: 3.9@mule-runtime::generic-connector.adoc

The Generic connector provides a wide array of configuration options that let you code the protocol into the address of the endpoint.

Mule supports numerous protocols which can be configured as endpoints. Many, but not all of the protocols included with Mule are already configured as endpoint-based connectors available as processors in the connectors category of the palette. These include *FTP*, *HTTP*, and *Ajax*, for instance.

[NOTE]
The Generic connector can also be used to specify these or additional endpoints, by entering the full address in the *Address* field, including the protocol designation within the address (`\ftp://foo`, `vm://foo`, `\https://foo`, etc.).

== To Install this Connector

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio taskbar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange.
. Search for the connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

When Studio has an update, a message displays in the lower right corner, which you can click to install the update.

== Configuring the Generic Connector

The normal properties windows tabs are at your disposal. Whether you use the connector to access an inbound or outbound endpoint, you configure the desired settings via these windows, or via the Configuration XML of your application. For background reading, see xref:3.9@mule-runtime::endpoint-configuration-reference.adoc[Endpoint Configuration Reference]

=== General Tab

Define the endpoint for your generic connector at a minimum, using the endpoint's *address* or by _referencing_ a created *Connector Configuration* global element that your Mule application can use to determine for the connector:

* *Encoding* for the processed messages
* *MIME Type* to direct the server in generating the response for your application
* Transport to be used (or not, *Disable Transport Transformer*), and,
* Exchange pattern: *one-way* or *request-response*.

=== Advanced Tab

Whether for a one-way or request-response generic connector, set additional properties on your endpoint(s) from the *Advanced* tab, where you can fix the endpoint address, and tune the connector to your desired use. Track your business events by default by selecting the corresponding checkbox (see below).

=== Reconnection Tab

By default, there is no reconnection strategy implemented for you, but you may choose to configure reconnection on a set frequency (*Standard Reconnection*) or via *Custom Reconnection* strategy.

=== Transformers Tab

== Inbound Endpoint

.Default inbound endpoint XML
`<inbound-endpoint address="" doc:name="Generic"/>`

An inbound endpoint receives messages via the associated transport. As with global endpoints, each transport implements its own inbound endpoint element.

=== Attributes of <inbound-endpoint...>

|Name |Type |Required |Description
|name |name (no spaces) |no | Identifies the endpoint in the registry. There is no need to set the 'name' attribute on inbound or outbound endpoints, only on global endpoints.
|ref |string |no |A reference to a global endpoint, which is used as a template to construct this endpoint. A template fixes the address (protocol, path, host, etc.), and may specify initial values for various properties, but further properties can be defined locally (as long as they do not change the address in any way).
|address |string |no |The generic address for this endpoint. If this attribute is used, the protocol must be specified as part of the URI. Alternatively, most transports provide their own attributes for specifying the address (path, host, etc.). Note that the address attribute cannot be combined with 'ref' or with the transport-provided alternative attributes.

== Global Configuration Reference

In XML only, you can also define a global generic endpoint and reference it from specific endpoints within your flows.

== Endpoint

A global endpoint, which acts as a template that can be used to construct an inbound or outbound endpoint elsewhere in the configuration by referencing the global endpoint name. Each transport implements its own endpoint element, with a more friendly syntax, but this generic element can be used with any transport by supplying the correct address URI. For example, "vm://foo" describes a VM transport endpoint.

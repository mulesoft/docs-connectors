Anypoint Connector for Azure Key Vault (Azure Key Vault Connector) enables you to retrieve secrets, keys, or certificates, and encrypt or decrypt content.


[[Config]]
== Configuration

Default Configuration for Azure Key Vault Connector.


[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | Name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x
| Connection a| <<Config_Connection, Connection>>
 | Connection types for this configuration. | | x
| Name a| String |  ID used to reference this configuration. |  | x
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before Mule considers it eligible for expiration.   |  |
|===

[[Config_Connection]]
=== Connection - Connection Type

Uses a client ID, client secret, and cryptography client cache for authentication.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]

[[PoolingProfile]]
=== Pooling Profile

Configures the pooling profile type.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Active a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can be borrowed from a session at one time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of components that are active at one time. When *Max Active* is exceeded, the pool is exhausted. |  |
| Max Idle a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that sit idle in the pool at any time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of Mule components that are idle at one time. |  |
| Max Wait a| Number | Specifies the number of milliseconds to wait for a pooled component to become available when the pool is exhausted and when *Exhausted Action* is set to `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT`. |  |
| Min Eviction Millis a| Number | Determines the minimum amount of time an object sits idle in the pool before the object is eligible for eviction. When non-positive, no objects are evicted from the pool due to idle time alone. |  |
| Eviction Check Interval Millis a| Number | Specifies the number of milliseconds between runs of the object evictor. When non-positive, no object evictor is executed. |  |
| Exhausted Action a| Enumeration, one of:

+
Throws a `NoSuchElementException`

* `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT`
+
Blocks by invoking Object.wait(long) until a new or idle object is available

* `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW`
+
Creates a new Mule instance and returns it, essentially making *Max Active* meaningless. If *Max Wait* is positive, `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW` blocks for at most that many milliseconds, after which a `NoSuchElementException` is thrown. If *Max Wait* is negative, `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW` blocks indefinitely. |  |

* `INITIALISE_NONE`
+
Does not load any components into the pool on startup

* `INITIALISE_ONE`
+
Loads one initial component into the pool on startup

* `INITIALISE_ALL`
+
Loads all components in the pool on startup |  |

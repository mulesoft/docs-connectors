The Anypoint Connector for *Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) 12.2* provides real-time connectivity to query and update Oracle EBS using *REST web services*. The connector has been *developed for the Oracle EBS v12.2.x*. For more information about Oracle EBS, visit the http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/ebusiness/overview/index.html[Oracle's official].

[NOTE]
Separately, there is a Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) connector built for the Oracle EBS v12.1.x that supports *SOAP web services and message queues*.

Read through this user guide to understand how to set up and configure a basic flow using the connector. Track feature additions, compatibility, limitations and API version updates with each release of the connector using the xref:release-notes::connector/oracle-ebs-122-connector-release-notes.adoc[Connector Release Notes]. Review the https://www.anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/?search=oracle%20ebs%2012.2[demo applications].

MuleSoft maintains this connector under the xref:3.9@mule-runtime::anypoint-connectors.adoc#connector-categories[_Premium_] support policy.

== Connector Architecture

Oracle EBS offers different technologies or products to address various types of integrations. Listed below are the most widely used for integration with enterprise applications:

. Data-centric integration.
. Integration through Web Services using Integrated SOA gateway.

The following illustration shows the integration architecture of the MuleSoft Oracle EBS connector:

image::oec122-architecture.png[Oracle EBS 12.2 - Connector Architecture]

[NOTE]
For further information, refer to http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26401_01/index.htm[Oracle E-Business Suite Documentation Web Library].

== Prerequisites

Because of how closely the connector is coupled with Oracle EBS, this document assumes you have:

* A working knowledge of Oracle EBS.
* Read the relevant documentation on Web Services and Integration Scenarios for your Oracle EBS version.

[TIP]
A definition and detailed explanation of the Oracle EBS terms and concepts used here are freely available in the Oracle documentation set of your Oracle installation.

=== Hardware and Software Requirements

For hardware and software requirements, please visit the xref:3.9@mule-runtime::hardware-and-software-requirements.adoc[Hardware and Software Requirements] page.

To use the Oracle EBS connector, you must have the following:

* *Web service configuration in Oracle EBS*: Configuring the Oracle EBS connector requires configuring REST web services in Oracle EBS and exposing them via the Integration Repository.
* *FND_WEB_SEC PL/SQL Service*: The connector requires Oracle EBS to have the FND_WEB_SEC PL/SQL service deployed.
* *REST Service Locator*: The connector requires Oracle EBS to have the REST Service Locator deployed as a REST service.
* *WADL names in lower case*: WADLs corresponding to deployed PL/SQLs must have their Internal Names in *lower case* as alias. For example, if you wish to deploy *PLSQL Interface : Absence Attendance Type*, which has *HR_ABSENCE_TYPE_API* as internal name, its Service Alias should be *hr_absence_type_api*.
* *Anypoint Studio*

=== Compatibility

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Software |Version
|*Mule Runtime* |3.7
|*Oracle EBS* |12.2.x
|*Java* |7
|===

[IMPORTANT]
This connector *only* supports Oracle EBS version *12.2.x*. If you require integration with version *12.1.x*, refer to https://www.anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/?search=Oracle%20E-Business%20Suite%20Connector&type=connector[Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) connector].

== To Install this Connector

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio taskbar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange.
. Search for the connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

When Studio has an update, a message displays in the lower right corner, which you can click to install the update.

== Before Using the Connector

=== Deploy the REST Service Locator

This is the very first task you need to accomplish in order to later expose your PL/SQL services for the connector to consume. The following steps were taken from Oracle's Developer's Guide tutorial https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26401_01/doc.122/e20927/T511473T634173.htm[Using Java APIs as REST Services]:

. Log in to Oracle E-Business Suite as a user who has the Integration Administrator role.

* Select the *Integrated SOA Gateway* responsibility and the *Integration Repository* link from the navigation menu.

. In the Integration Repository tab, click Search to access the main Search page.

. Click *Show More Search Options* to display more search fields.

* Enter the following key search values as the search criteria:

** Category: Interface Subtype

** Category Value: *Java Bean Services*

. Click *Go* to execute the search.

* Click the *REST Service Locator* interface name link to open the interface details page.

. In the REST Web Service tab, enter the following information:
+
image::oec122-deploy-rest-service-locator-1.png[Oracle EBS 12.2 - REST Service Locator Un-deployed]

* Service Alias: restServiceLocator

** The alias will be displayed as the service endpoint in the WADL and schema for the selected method or operation.

* Select Desired Service Operations

** In the Service Operations region, HTTP method check boxes are preselected.
+
[NOTE]
If a Java method is annotated with a specific HTTP method, then the corresponding HTTP method check box is preselected for that method. The administrator can change the HTTP method check box selection before deploying the service.
In this example, the *'getRestInterface'* service operation has been annotated with the GET HTTP method; therefore, the GET check box is automatically selected.

. Click *Deploy* to deploy the service to an Oracle E-Business Suite WebLogic environment.

    * Once the REST service has been successfully deployed, 'Deployed' appears in the REST Service Status field along with the *View WADL* link. Click the *View WADL* link to view the deployed service WADL description.
+
image::oec122-deploy-rest-service-locator-2.png[Oracle EBS 12.2 - REST Service Locator Deployed]

=== Deploy a PL/SQL API as a REST Service (WADL)

The following steps describe the procedure to deploy the PL/SQL "Adjustment API" as a REST service. The same guide applies to any PL/SQL.

. Log in to Oracle E-Business Suite as a user who has the Integration Administrator role.

* Select the *Integrated SOA Gateway* responsibility and the *Integration Repository* link from the navigation menu.

. In the Integration Repository tab, click Search to access the main Search page.

. Click *Show More Search Options* to display more search fields.

* Enter the following key search values as the search criteria:

** Category: Interface Subtype

** Category Value: PL/SQL

** Internal Name: FA_ADJUSTMENT_PUB
+
image::oec122-deploy-plsql-1.png[Deploy PL/SQL - Search]

. Click *Go* to execute the search.

** Click on the Adjustments API link to see the interface details.
+
image::oec122-deploy-plsql-2.png[Deploy PL/SQL - Adjustment API]

* Click the *REST Service Locator* interface name link to open the interface details page.

. In the REST Web Service tab, enter the following information:
+
image::oec122-deploy-plsql-3.png[Deploy PL/SQL - Adjustment API Configuration]
+
IMPORTANT: The alias of the deployed web service *MUST* be: 1) the Internal Name and 2) be written in lowercase. The alias information can be found under the label *Service Alias*. In this example, it is *fa_adjustment_pub*.

. Click *Deploy* to deploy the service to an Oracle E-Business Suite WebLogic environment.

    * Once the REST service has been successfully deployed, 'Deployed' appears in the REST Service Status field along with the *View WADL* link. Click the *View WADL* link to view the deployed service WADL description.

== Using the Connector

Oracle EBS 12.2 connector is and operation-based connector that supports the *invocation of any PL/SQL REST service* deployed in the Oracle system.

=== Connector Namespace and Schema

When designing your application in Studio, the act of dragging the connector from the palette onto the Anypoint Studio canvas should automatically populate the XML code with the connector *namespace* and *schema location*.

[TIP]
If you are manually coding the Mule application in Studio's XML editor or other text editor, define the namespace and schema location in the header of your *Configuration XML*, inside the `<mule>` tag.

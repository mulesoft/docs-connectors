== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with FTPS,
Mule, Anypoint connectors, Anypoint Studio, elements in a Mule flow,
and global elements.

=== Hardware and Software Requirements

See xref:3.9@mule-runtime::hardware-and-software-requirements.adoc[Hardware and Software Requirements].


=== Compatibility

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Application or Service |Version
|Mule | 3.7.0 and later
|===

== Install the Connector

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio taskbar.
. Sign in to Exchange with your Anypoint Platform credentials.
. From Anypoint Exchange, click *Provided by MuleSoft*.
. Search for the Mule 3 connector and click *Install*.

[[configuring]]
== Configure the FTPS Connector Global Element

You can configure a global element for the FTPS connector for use by multiple instances of the FTPS connector in your application. However, not all connector instances use the same global element or configuration. For example, multiple connectors in a flow might use different global elements or configurations to connect to multiple instances.

You can provide connection and other details in the Global Element Properties window. These settings
are saved in a global element and referenced by applicable connector instances:

image:ftps_basic_config.png[Configuration]

In this example, the placeholder values refer to values saved in a `.properties` file, which exists by default in the `src/main/resources` folder of your project. See xref:3.9@mule-runtime::configuring-properties.adoc[Configuring Properties].

For ease of maintenance and reusability, you should use a `.properties` file for your FTPS connector properties, rather than hardcoding these values in the global element.
When you use the `.properties` file, you can deploy the app to different environments, such as production, development, and QA, changing the credentials, if needed.
See xref:3.9@mule-runtime::deploying-to-multiple-environments.adoc[Deploying to Multiple Environments].


=== Global Element Properties for FTPS Connector

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|Username | User name on the FTPS server.

If the server allows anonymous login, you can use `anonymous` as the username.
|Password | Password for the username.

For anonymous login, this field can be empty.
|Host | Host address of the FTPS server.
|Port | Port where the FTPS service is running.
|Keystore path | Path to the keystore to use for SSL.
|Keystore password | Password for the keystore file.
|Read timeout | Time (milliseconds) that the consumer waits for a
response before it times out.

The default value is 0 (infinite).
|Connection timeout | Time (milliseconds) that the consumer attempts
to establish a connection before it times out.

The default value is 0 (infinite).
|Disable Certificate Validation | Option to disable SSL certificate validation, which ignores certificates
and uses the `Trust all` policy.

This option is not recommended.
|Encryption mode | Mode to invoke client security: IMPLICIT or EXPLICIT.
|Transfer mode | Mode to establish data connection: PASSIVE or ACTIVE.
|===

==== Pooling Profile

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Active a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can be borrowed from a session at one time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of components that may be active at one time. When maxActive is exceeded, the pool is said to be exhausted. |  |
| Max Idle a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can sit idle in the pool at any time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of Mule components that may be idle at one time. |  |
| Max Wait a| Number | Specifies the number of milliseconds to wait for a pooled component to become available when the pool is exhausted and the exhaustedAction is set to `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT`. |  |
| Min Eviction Millis a| Number | Determines the minimum amount of time an object may sit idle in the pool before it is eligible for eviction. When non-positive, no objects will be evicted from the pool due to idle time alone. |  |
| Eviction Check Interval Millis a| Number | Specifies the number of milliseconds between runs of the object evictor. When non-positive, no object evictor is executed. |  |
| Exhausted Action a| Enumeration, one of:

** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW
** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT
** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL a| Specifies the behavior of the Mule component pool when the pool is exhausted. Possible values are:

* `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL` Will throw a NoSuchElementException
* `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT` Will block by invoking Object.wait(long) until a new or idle object is available
* `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW` Will create a new Mule instance and return it, essentially making maxActive meaningless. If a positive maxWait value is supplied, it will block for, at most, that many milliseconds, after which a `NoSuchElementException` is thrown. If maxThreadWait is a negative value, it is blocked indefinitely. |  |
| Initialisation Policy a| Enumeration, one of:

** INITIALISE_NONE
** INITIALISE_ONE
** INITIALISE_ALL a| Determines how components in a pool should be initialized. The possible values are:

* `INITIALISE_NONE` Will not load any components into the pool on startup
* `INITIALISE_ONE` Will load one initial component into the pool on startup
* `INITIALISE_ALL` Will load all components in the pool on startup |  |
|===

==== Reconnection

Defines how Mule runtime engine attempts to manage a connection failure.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Standard Reconnection a| * <<reconnect>>
* <<reconnect-forever>> | The reconnection strategy to use. |  |
|===

[[reconnect]]
=== Standard Reconnection

A reconnection strategy to configure how many times a reconnection should be attempted and how long to wait between attempts.

| Reconnection Attempts a| Number | How many reconnection attempts to make. | |
| Run the reconnection in a separated thread |Boolean |If true, the reconnection strategy runs in a separate, non-blocking thread. |false |
|===

[[reconnect-forever]]
=== Reconnect Forever

A reconnection strategy that retries an infinite number of times at the specified frequency.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Frequency a| Number | How often in milliseconds to reconnect. | |
| Run the reconnection in a separated thread |Boolean |If true, the reconnection strategy runs in a separate, non-blocking thread. |false |
|===


== Using the FTPS Connector

The FTPS connector is based on the concept of the endpoint. You can configure the global element either:

* Inbound endpoint to read files from an FTPS server
* Outbound connector to upload a file to an FTPS server

=== Connector Namespace and Schema

In Anypoint Studio, when you drag the FTPS connector from the palette to the canvas, Studio automatically populates the Mule application XML code with the FTP connector namespace and schema location.

*Namespace:*

[source, xml]
----
xmlns:ftps="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ftps"
----

*Schema Location:*

[source, xml]
----
http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ftps http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ftps/current/mule-ftps.xsd
----

If you are manually coding the Mule application in the XML editor in Studio or other text editor, define the namespace and schema location in the header of your configuration XML, inside the `<mule>` tag:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<mule xmlns="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xmlns:ftps="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ftps"
      xsi:schemaLocation="
               http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core
               http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core/current/mule.xsd
               http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ftps
	       http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ftps/current/mule-ftps.xsd">

      <!-- put your global configuration elements and flows here -->

</mule>
----

=== Using the Connector in a Mavenized Mule App

If you are coding a Mavenized Mule application, include this XML snippet in your `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.mulesoft.connectors</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-ftps-transport</artifactId>
  <version>3.1.0</version>
</dependency>
----

Enter the current version number in the `<version>` tag. The current version is 3.1.0.

== FTPS Connector Example Use Cases

The example use cases are intended for Anypoint Studio users.

If you are configuring the application in XML, skip to the example Mule application XML code to see how the FTPS global element and the connector are configured in the XML in each use case:

* <<Read Files from an FTPS Server - XML,Read files>>
* <<Write Files to an FTPS Server - XML,Write files>>

=== Read Files from an FTPS Server and Log File Content - Studio

To use Anypoint Studio to read files from an FTPS server:

. In Studio, click File > New > Mule Project to create a new Mule Project.
. With your project open, search the Studio palette for the FTPS connector that you previously <<Install the FTPS Connector,installed>>.

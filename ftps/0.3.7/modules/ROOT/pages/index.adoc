= FTPS Connector - Mule 3
:page-aliases: 3.7@mule-runtime::ftps-connector-mule3.adoc

Support Category: Premium

Anypoint Connector for FTPS (FTPS Connector) enables you to send and receive files over FTPS, providing seamless integration between Mule applications and an FTPS server.

Use this guide to set up and configure a basic Mule flow with the FTPS connector.

For software requirements and compatibility
information, see the xref:release-notes::connector/ftps-connector-release-notes.adoc[FTPS Connector Release Notes].

== Before You Begin

This document assumes that you are familiar with FTPS,
Mule, Anypoint connectors, Anypoint Studio, elements in a Mule flow,
and global elements.

=== Hardware and Software Requirements

See xref:3.9@mule-runtime::hardware-and-software-requirements.adoc[Hardware and Software Requirements].


=== Compatibility

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Application or Service |Version
|Mule | 3.7.0 and later
|===

== Install the FTPS Connector

To install the FTPS connector:

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon.
. Click *Login* in Anypoint Exchange and enter your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. Search for the FTPS connector and click *Install*.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

[[configuring]]
== Configuring the FTPS Connector Global Element

You can configure a global element for the FTPS connector for use by multiple instances of the FTPS connector in your application. However, not all connector instances use the same global element or configuration. For example, multiple connectors in a flow might use different global elements or configurations to connect to multiple instances.

You can provide connection and other details in the Global Element Properties window. These settings
are saved in a global element and referenced by applicable connector instances:

image:ftps_basic_config.png[Configuration]

In this example, the placeholder values refer to values saved in a `.properties` file, which exists by default in the `src/main/resources` folder of your project. See xref:3.7@mule-runtime::configuring-properties.adoc[Configuring Properties].

For ease of maintenance and reusability, you should use a `.properties` file for your FTPS connector properties, rather than hardcoding these values in the global element.
When you use the `.properties` file, you can deploy the app to different environments, such as production, development, and QA, changing the credentials, if needed.
See xref:3.7@mule-runtime::deploying-to-multiple-environments.adoc[Deploying to Multiple Environments].


=== Global Element Properties for FTPS Connector

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|Username | User name on the FTPS server.

If the server allows anonymous login, you can use `anonymous` as the username.
|Password | Password for the username.

For anonymous login, this field can be empty.
|Host | Host address of the FTPS server.
|Port | Port where the FTPS service is running.
|Keystore path | Path to the keystore to use for SSL.
|Keystore password | Password for the keystore file.
|Read timeout | Time (milliseconds) that the consumer waits for a
response before it times out.

The default value is 0 (infinite).
|Connection timeout | Time (milliseconds) that the consumer attempts
to establish a connection before it times out.

The default value is 0 (infinite).
|Disable Certificate Validation | Option to disable SSL certificate validation, which ignores certificates
and uses the `Trust all` policy.

This option is not recommended.
|Encryption mode | Mode to invoke client security: IMPLICIT or EXPLICIT.
|Transfer mode | Mode to establish data connection: PASSIVE or ACTIVE.
|===

== Using the FTPS Connector

The FTPS connector is based on the concept of the endpoint. You can configure the global element either:

* Inbound endpoint to read files from an FTPS server
* Outbound connector to upload a file to an FTPS server

=== Connector Namespace and Schema

In Anypoint Studio, when you drag the FTPS connector from the palette to the canvas, Studio automatically populates the Mule application XML code with the FTP connector namespace and schema location.

*Namespace:*

[source, xml]
----
xmlns:ftps="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ftps"
----

*Schema Location:*

[source, xml]
----
http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ftps http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ftps/current/mule-ftps.xsd
----

If you are manually coding the Mule application in the XML editor in Studio or other text editor, define the namespace and schema location in the header of your configuration XML, inside the `<mule>` tag:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<mule xmlns="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xmlns:ftps="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ftps"
      xsi:schemaLocation="
               http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core
               http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core/current/mule.xsd
               http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ftps
	       http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ftps/current/mule-ftps.xsd">

      <!-- put your global configuration elements and flows here -->

</mule>
----

=== Using the Connector in a Mavenized Mule App

If you are coding a Mavenized Mule application, include this XML snippet in your `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.mulesoft.connectors</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-ftps-transport</artifactId>
  <version>3.1.0</version>
</dependency>
----

Enter the current version number in the `<version>` tag. The current version is 3.1.0.

== FTPS Connector Example Use Cases

The example use cases are intended for Anypoint Studio users.

If you are configuring the application in XML, skip to the example Mule application XML code to see how the FTPS global element and the connector are configured in the XML in each use case:

* <<Read Files from an FTPS Server - XML,Read files>>
* <<Write Files to an FTPS Server - XML,Write files>>

=== Read Files from an FTPS Server and Log File Content - Studio

To use Anypoint Studio to read files from an FTPS server:

. In Studio, click File > New > Mule Project to create a new Mule Project.
. With your project open, search the Studio palette for the FTPS connector that you previously <<Install the FTPS Connector,installed>>.
. Drag a new FTPS connector onto the canvas.
. Drag a Logger after the FTPS element to log incoming messages in the console.
+
image:ftps-read_flow.png[Read flow]
+
. Double-click the flow header and rename it `read-flow`.
+
image:ftps-read_flow_config.png[Read flow configuration]
+
. Double-click the FTPS connector element and configure its properties to the following:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Value
|Display Name |FTPS (Streaming)
|Consumer Configuration |`FTPS_Basic_config` (default name of a configuration)

You can set this value to the name of any other configuration that you previously <<configuring,configured>>.
|Operation |Read
|Directory to move to | Directory to move the files after they are read from the server.

If empty, the files are deleted.
|File name | Filename pattern for the files to read.
|Maximum concurrent reads | Number of threads (connections) to use to read files.
|ASCII Data Type|Whether the files to read are ASCII or BINARY.

The default is BINARY.
|Streaming | Whether to send an InputStream as the message payload (true) or as a byte array (false).

The default is false.
|Pooling period | Interval to query the server for files.

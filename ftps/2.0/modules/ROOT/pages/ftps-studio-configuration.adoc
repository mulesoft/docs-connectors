= Using Anypoint Studio to Configure FTPS Connector 2.0 - Mule 4

Anypoint Studio (Studio) editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.

To add and configure a connector in Studio:

. <<create-mule-project,Create a Mule project>>.
. <<add-connector-to-project,Add the connector to your Mule project>>.
. <<configure-input-source,Configure a source for the connector's flow>>.
. <<add-connector-operation,Add a connector operation to the flow>>.
. <<configure-global-element,Configure a global element for the connector>>.
. <<configure-ftps-mode,Configure FTPS Mode for FTPS Connector>>.
. <<configure-tls,Configure TLS with Keystores and Truststores>>.
. <<configure-java,Configure Java JDK for Session Reuse>>.


When you run the connector, you can view the app log to check for problems in real time, as described in <<view-app-log,View the App Log>>.

If you are new to configuring connectors in Studio, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-config-use-studio.adoc[Use Studio to Configure a Connector]. If, after reading this topic, you need additional information about the connector fields, see the xref:ftps-documentation.adoc[FTPS Connector Reference Reference].

[[create-mule-project]]
== Create a Mule Project

In Studio, create a new Mule project in which to add and configure the connector:

. In Studio, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
. Enter a name for your Mule project and click *Finish*.


[[add-connector-to-project]]
== Add the Connector to Your Mule Project

Add FTPS Connector to your Mule project to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location and to add the required dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In the *Add Dependencies to Project* window, type `ftps` in the search field.
. Click *FTPS Connector* in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.


[[configure-input-source]]
== Configure a Source

A source initiates a flow when a specified condition is met.
You can configure one of these sources to use with FTPS Connector:

* *On New or Updated File* +
Initiates a flow by polling a directory for files that have been created or updated and generates a message for each file found.
* *HTTP Listener* +
Initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port.
* *Scheduler* +
Initiates a flow when a time-based condition is met.

For example, to configure the On New or Updated File source, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *On New or Updated File*.
. Drag *On New or Updated File* to the Studio canvas.
. On the *On New or Updated File* configuration screen, optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. Specify a value for the *Path* field.
. Click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of *On New or Updated File* in the app.
. On the *General* tab, specify the connection information for the connector.
. Set *Host* to specify the FTPS server host, for example, `localhost` or `192.168.0.1`.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.
. On the *On New or Updated File* configuration screen, specify a *Scheduling Strategy* value and optionally complete other fields.

[[add-connector-operation]]
== Add a Connector Operation to the Flow

When you add a connector operation to your flow, you immediately define a specific operation for that connector to perform.

To add an operation for FTPS Connector, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *FTPS* and then select the desired operation.
. Drag the operation onto the Studio canvas and to the right of the source.

[[configure-global-element]]
== Configure a Global Element for the Connector

When you configure a connector, it’s best to configure a global element that all instances of that connector in the app can use. Configuring a global element requires you to configure the FTP server connection.

To configure the global element for FTPS Connector, follow these steps:

. Select the name of the connector in the Studio canvas.
. Select the operation in the Studio canvas.
. In the configuration screen for the operation, click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to access the global element configuration fields.
. On the *General* tab, specify the connection information for the connector:
. Set the *Working Directory* as the root of every relative path used with this connector. +
If it's not provided, the value defaults to the remote server.
. Set *Host* to specify the FTPS server host, for example, `localhost` or `0.0.0.0`.
. Set *Username* and *Password*.
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify a timeout configuration and reconnection strategy.
. On the *TLS* tab, specify TLS configuration.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

image::ftps-proxy-configuration.png[FTPS Connector Global Element Configuration] 

In the *Configuration XML* editor, the configuration `ftps:config` looks like this:
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<ftps:config name="FTPS_Config">
  <ftps:connection username="anonymous" password="password"
   host="0.0.0.0" port="21" workingDir="${workingDir}">
    <tls:context>
        <tls:trust-store path="path/to/keystore" password="mulepassword" />
    </tls:context>
  </ftps:connection>
</ftps:config>
----

[[configure-ftps-mode]]
== Configure FTPS Mode for FTPS Connector

In the global element configuration, you can configure the *Ftps mode* field to either the following options:

* *Ftps explicit mode (Default)*
The explicit mode connects in an unprotected way to the FTP server. The client can negotiate TLS for either the command or data channel.
* *Ftps implicit mode*
The implicit mode assumes that a secure connection through an SSL/TLS handshake must take place before any FTP command is sent. This ensures that the entire FTP session is encrypted.

When you configure the *Ftps explicit mode (Default)*, you can also configure the data channel protection level through the *PROT Settings* field to either one of these options:

* *CLEAR*
The clear protection level indicates that the data channel carries the raw data of the file transfer, with no security applied. This is the default value.
* *PRIVATE*
The private protection level indicates that the integrity of the data and confidentiality are protected.

In the *Configuration XML* editor, the `ftps=mode`, `ftps-explicit-mode`, and `protSetting` configurations look like this:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
 <ftps:config name="FTPS_Config">
   <ftps:connection username="anonymous" password="password"
    host="0.0.0.0" port="21" workingDir="${workingDir}">
     <tls:context>
         <tls:trust-store path="path/to/keystore" password="mulepassword" />
     </tls:context>
     <ftps:ftps-mode >
         <ftps:ftps-explicit-mode protSetting="PRIVATE" />
     </ftps:ftps-mode>
   </ftps:connection>
 </ftps:config>
----

image::ftps-implicit-mode.png[FTPS Connector implicit mode configuration in Studio]

In the *Configuration XML* editor, the `ftps=mode` and `ftps-implicit-mode` configurations look like this:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<ftps:config name="FTPS_Config">
  <ftps:connection username="anonymous" password="password"
   host="0.0.0.0" port="21" workingDir="${workingDir}">
    <tls:context>
        <tls:trust-store path="path/to/keystore" password="mulepassword" />
    </tls:context>
    <ftps:ftps-mode >
        <ftps:ftps-implicit-mode />
    </ftps:ftps-mode>
  </ftps:connection>
</ftps:config>
----

[[configure-tls]]
== Configure TLS with Keystores and Truststores

You can use Transport Layer Security (TLS) and configure FTPS by providing a key store with your certificate. You can also enable 2-way authentication by providing a trust store. For more information about TLS configuration, refer to the  xref:mule-runtime::tls-configuration.adoc[configure TLS with Keystores and Truststores] documentation.

[[configure-java]]
== Configure Java JDK for Session Reuse

To reuse sessions using FTPS, you must disable the Extended Main Secret extension for compatibility (JDK-8192045), which by default is set to `true`. The extension protects users from vulnerabilities by using the same session on different groups of clients and servers. Which contradicts the demand to use the same session for control and data connections. With the Extended Main Secret extension activated, session reuse is possible only by endpoint verification, which is implemented for HTTPS and LDAP only.

=== Configure Bouncy Castle Libraries and Security Provider

To reuse sessions using FTPS Connector, you must deliver Bouncy Castle libraries to the `JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext` folder and set up the Bouncy Castle security provider:

. Open `AnypointStudio.ini` file and identify where Java VM is stored. The path to VM is set up by the `-vm` command. Consider the following path `JAVA_VM_FOLDER`.
. Download the `bc-fips.jar`, `bctls-fips.jar`, and `bcpkix-fips.jar` files from https://www.bouncycastle.org/fips-java/.
. Place the files in the `JAVA_VM_FOLDER/jre/lib/ext` folder.
. Open the `JAVA_VM_FOLDER/jre/lib/security/java.security` file.
. Set the Bouncy Castle security providers at the beginning of the file, as shown in the following section:
+
|=======
|security.provider.1=org.bouncycastle.jcajce.provider.BouncyCastleFipsProvider
security.provider.2=org.bouncycastle.jsse.provider.BouncyCastleJsseProvider fips:BCFIPS
security.provider.3=sun.security.provider.Sun
security.provider.4=sun.security.rsa.SunRsaSign
security.provider.5=sun.security.ec.SunEC
security.provider.6=com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.Provider
security.provider.7=com.sun.crypto.provider.SunJCE
security.provider.8=sun.security.jgss.SunProvider
security.provider.9=com.sun.security.sasl.Provider
security.provider.10=org.jcp.xml.dsig.internal.dom.XMLDSigRI
security.provider.11=sun.security.smartcardio.SunPCSC
security.provider.12=apple.security.AppleProvider
|=======

+
Because Bouncy Castle libraries does not support anymore JKS keystore or truststore, migrate all keystores or truststores used by standalone to `BKS`, `PCKS12`, `BCFKS`, `Keystore.BouncyCastle`, or `Keystore.UBER`. Documentation may be found here. 

[start=5]
. Change the default keystore, key manager, and trust manager types to `PKIX` in `java.security` file as shown in the following section:
+

|=======
|ssl.KeyManagerFactory.algorithm=PKIX
ssl.TrustManagerFactory.algorithm=PKIX
keystore.type=PKCS12
|=======

image::ftps-jvm-configuration.png[JVM argument to disable Extended Main Secret in Run Configurations window]

[start=6]
. Click *Apply*.
. Click *Run*.

=== Enable SSL Session Resumption for Standalone

To enable SSL session resumption for standalone, follow the steps:

. Download the `bc-fips.jar`, `bctls-fips.jar`, and `bcpkix-fips.jar` files from https://www.bouncycastle.org/fips-java/.
. Place the files in the `JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext`folder.
. Open the `JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security` file.
. Set the Bouncy Castle security providers at the beginning of the file, as shown in the following section:
+
|=======
|security.provider.1=org.bouncycastle.jcajce.provider.BouncyCastleFipsProvider
security.provider.2=org.bouncycastle.jsse.provider.BouncyCastleJsseProvider fips:BCFIPS
security.provider.3=sun.security.provider.Sun
security.provider.4=sun.security.rsa.SunRsaSign
security.provider.5=sun.security.ec.SunEC
security.provider.6=com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.Provider
security.provider.7=com.sun.crypto.provider.SunJCE
security.provider.8=sun.security.jgss.SunProvider
security.provider.9=com.sun.security.sasl.Provider
security.provider.10=org.jcp.xml.dsig.internal.dom.XMLDSigRI
security.provider.11=sun.security.smartcardio.SunPCSC
security.provider.12=apple.security.AppleProvider
|=======

+
Because Bouncy Castle libraries does not support anymore JKS keystore or truststore, migrate all keystores or truststores used by standalone to `BKS`, `PCKS12`, `BCFKS`, `Keystore.BouncyCastle`, or `Keystore.UBER`. Documentation may be found here. 

[start=4]
. Change the default keystore, key manager, and trust manager types to `PKIX` in `java.security` file, as shown in the following section:
+
|=======
|ssl.KeyManagerFactory.algorithm=PKIX
ssl.TrustManagerFactory.algorithm=PKIX
keystore.type=PKCS12
|=======

=== Enable SSL Session Resumption for CloudHub and Runtime Fabric

To enable SSL session resumption for Cloudhub and Runtime Fabric, set the `mule.security.provider` property to `BC`, for example:

`mule.security.provider=BC`

For further details about the configuration, refer to https://help.mulesoft.com/s/article/Enabling-the-Bouncy-Castle-security-provider [setting up Bouncy Castle security provider] knowledge base article.


[[view-app-log]]
== View the App Log

To check for problems, you can view the app log as follows:

* If you’re running the app from Anypoint Platform, the output is visible in the Anypoint Studio console window.
* If you’re running the app using Mule from the command line, the app log is visible in your OS console.

Unless the log file path is customized in the app’s log file (`log4j2.xml`), you can also view the app log in the default location `MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`.

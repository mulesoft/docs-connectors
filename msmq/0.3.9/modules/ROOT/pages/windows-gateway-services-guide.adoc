*Latest version: 1.12.0*

Windows Gateway Services provides connectivity to proprietary functionality on the Windows platform, and is used by the following connectors:

* xref:3.9@mule-runtime::microsoft-dynamics-ax-2012-connector.adoc[Dynamics AX Connector]
* xref:3.9@mule-runtime::microsoft-dynamics-crm-connector.adoc[Dynamics CRM Connector]
* xref:msmq-connector-user-guide.adoc[MSMQ connector]
* xref:3.9@mule-runtime::windows-powershell-connector-guide.adoc[PowerShell Connector]

The Windows Gateway leverages the following technologies and frameworks:

* http://www.asp.net/web-api[ASP.NET Web API] exposes an HTTP web API that sends and receives raw messages.
* http://owin.org/[OWIN] provides the HTTP layer. Open Web Interface for .NET (OWIN) is an open specification for decoupling applications from web server functionality, which provides a layer for making all the HTTP concerns independent of the hosting platform.
* http://www.asp.net/aspnet/overview/owin-and-katana[Katana] provides the OWIN Microsoft implementation, which handles self and IIS hosting for OWIN applications.

Release Notes:

== Before You Begin

`Java Cryptography Extensions` needs to be installed on the server where Mule is installed. The JCE package is required to allow the Connector to use HTTPS to communicate securely. You can install JCE for your Java version from the Oracle website:

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

For TLS 1.2 to be enabled and negotiated on servers that run Windows Server 2008 R2, you MUST create the "DisabledByDefault" entry in the appropriate subkey (Client, Server) and set it to "0". The entry does not appear in the registry and it is set to "1" by default.

== Installing the Windows Gateway Services

NOTE: Installation requires Windows 2008 Server, Windows 2008 R2 Server, Windows 2012 Server, and .NET Framework 4.5 and newer.

Installation steps:

. Download the Windows Gateway Services installer from https://repository-master.mulesoft.org/nexus/content/repositories/releases/org/mule/modules/anypoint-windows-gateway-service/1.12.0/anypoint-windows-gateway-service-1.12.0.zip[here]. Unzip the software distribution.
. Double-click the `Anypoint-Windows-Gateway-Service.exe` file.
. Click *Options* to change the installation location, or click *Install* to start the installation.
. If you plan to use the MSMQ and/or PowerShell connectors along with the Gateway, copy the Authentication Token that is displayed for later use when you configure the connection in Anypoint Studio, otherwise skip this step. After you copy the token, click *Install*.
. After the installation completes, the installer gives you the option to view the `readme.txt` file with additional instructions.
. Click *Finish* to exit.
. The installation creates the new *Anypoint Gateway* Windows service, which the installer starts.

To view the running service in Windows 7, when the Control Panel *View by* option is set to *Small icons*, click *Control Panel* > *Administrative Tools* > *Services*. The service appears as:

image::servicestool.png[ServicesTool]

== Configuring the Anypoint Gateway

The default install location for the Windows Service is `c:\Program Files(x86)\Anypoint Gateway for Windows` unless you have chosen another folder when you installed it. This folder contains the `Mule.SelfHost.exe` executable, the `Mule.SelfHost.exe.config` configuration file and PowerShell scripts to automate configuration tasks.

*Note*: If the configuration file doesn't appear in the folder, in Windows 7, when the Control Panel *View by* option is set to *Small icons*, click *Control Panel* > *Folder Options* > *View* > *Show hidden files, folders, and drives.*

The executable starts a new web server at port 9333 (default), which only accepts secure connections using HTTPS. You can change the port number where the Gateway listens in the following places within the `Mule.SelfHost.exe.config` configuration file:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<appSettings>
    <!-- Configure the service to listen on the following address. -->
    <add key="OwinHostAddress" value="https://+:9333/"/>
    ...
</appSettings>
 ...
<system.serviceModel>
    <services>
      <service behaviorConfiguration="routing"
          name="System.ServiceModel.Routing.RoutingService">
        <host>
          <baseAddresses>
            <add baseAddress="https://*:9333/router"/>
          </baseAddresses>
    ...
</system.serviceModel>
----

This web server uses a self-signed SSL certificate auto-generated during installation. The certificate is in the *Personal* folder of the *Local Computer* certificate store:

image::mmc-personal-certs.png[MMC_Personal_Certs]

The following are examples for creating a valid a self-signed certificate to be imported on the Windows Server. The commands you need to execute to generate the certificate with OpenSSL are from OpenSSL bin folder. You also need to copy the certificate `cert_with_san.txt` to your `bin` folder:

`openssl.exe req -x509 -nodes -days 730 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout newcert.pem -out newcert.pem -config cert_with_san.txt` +
`openssl.exe pkcs12 -export -out newcert.pfx -in newcert.pem -name "My Cert" -passout pass:mypassword`

You can then register the certificate. Note that using self-signed certificate requires that you
ignore SSL warnings and add the certificate to the truststore used by the client application.

The contents of cert_with_san.txt follows. (This is for localhost or 127.0.0.1 usage.)

[source,text,linenums]
----
[req]
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
x509_extensions = v3_req
prompt = no
[req_distinguished_name]
C = US
ST = VA
L = Somewhere
O = MyOrg
OU = MyOU
CN = Anypoint Gateway
[v3_req]
keyUsage = keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth
subjectAltName = @alt_names
[alt_names]
DNS.1 = localhost
DNS.2 = 127.0.0.1
IP.1 = 127.0.0.1
IP.2 = 127.0.0.1
----

Because the Windows service relies on `http.sys` for self-hosting the web server, changes in the port number or SSL certificate require reconfiguring Windows. The `Register-SslCert.ps1` PowerShell script in the installation directory handles this task. If the port or certificate changes, run the following command from a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell[PowerShell] console:

`Register-SslCert.ps1 <certificate-thumbprint> <windows-account> <port>`

* `<certificate-thumbprint>`: The thumbprint of the SSL certificate. It must be stored in the Personal Folder of the Local Store Account.
* `<windows-account>`: Windows User or Group that receives permissions to register the port. The account impersonating the Windows service or console application must be part of this group.
* `<port>`: HTTP port â€“ Must be *9333* (default) - Or the port you have set in the configuration file.

Example:

`Register-SslCert.ps1 a495cbf8c4af496f1ef81efb224c8097d039f922 everyone 9333`

== Configuring MSMQ and PowerShell Connector Settings

=== Security Considerations

For these connectors, running in the Mule ESB, the service first authenticates the call by inspecting the HTTP Authorization header as specified in the https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.8[RFC 2616].

As said, the authentication is done through this unique security token used by both connectors. This token is included on every HTTP request to the Gateway using the Mule scheme. The following example shows how MSMQ leverages the Gateway to connect to a specific queue sending the security token as specified in this section (the same authorization header applies for PowerShell):

[source,text,linenums]
----
GET: https://localhost:9333/msmq?count=50
Authorization: mule 3nGdw7W+G1fSO2YBEHDmpo4N1Tg=
Mule-Msmq-Queue-Name: .\private$\out
Mule-Api-Version: 1.0
----

The authorization token should match on the connector and the Gateway configuration file. The following configuration setting shows how the token is set within the Gateway configuration file  `Mule.SelfHost.exe.config` :

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<appSettings>
    <!-- Token that must be sent by the Mule connector's client in the Authorization header when accessing the Rest Api. -->
    <add key="mule-auth-token" value="3nGdw7W+G1fSO2YBEHDmpo4N1Tg="/>
</appSettings>
----

When you configure the connectors running in the Mule ESB, the authorization token value should be set at the `'Gateway Access Token'` configuration setting (`accessToken` attribute at the connector's XML configuration).

*Note*: The installer for the Windows Gateway service automatically generates a cryptographically secure token for use by callers upon first install. This token is displayed and placed upon the clipboard during installation for easy copying into a Mule application.

=== Impersonating a Windows User

Users executing the call on behalf of a Gateway-served connector authenticate through two custom HTTP headers, `mule-impersonate-username` and `mule-impersonate-password`.

These two headers represent the Windows credentials of an existing user in the Active Directory forest where the Windows Gateway service is running, or a local account on the machine hosting the service. When these HTTP headers are included in an HTTP Request, the Windows Gateway service authenticates and impersonates this user before executing the operation required by the connector. This provides the ability to configure the correct access control list permissions using Windows credentials.

=== MSMQ Specific

The following diagram shows the interaction of the MSMQ connector with the Gateway, along with the main components used:

image::windowsgateway.png[WindowsGateway]

==== Configuration Settings

In the following table you can find the configuration settings that are only related to the MSMQ connector:

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|Property |Usage
|*invalid-queue-name* |The queue name where unreadable messages are moved to.
|*transaction-timeout* |The timeout for processing messages since they got retrieved by the connector. When the cleanup task finds a message which timeout expired it moves the message to the main queue to be available back again (for details check two phase commit section at the connector's guide).
|*invalid-message-timeout* |The timeout for invalid messages for when a payload of a message is parsed with an incorrect formatter.
|*cleanup-delay* |The delay of the cleanup task to start looking for expired messages after they got retrieved for processing (for details check two phase commit section at the connector's guide).
|*cleanup-username* |(Optional) The user to impersonate when running the cleanup task. If you choose to leave this setting empty then the user account running the service will be used.
|*cleanup-password* |(Optional) The password for the user to impersonate when running the cleanup task.
|===

==== Impersonating a Windows User

When your queue is marked to require authentication then you can impersonate the caller user as specified above (in the same general section). In addition to this, if you work with a remote queue the connector has a particular header to override this behavior (for details check the connector's guide).

=== Load Balanced Configuration

Windows Gateway Services supports running in a load-balanced configuration to allow for fault tolerance. When running multiple gateway services instances, each member should be configured to perform MSMQ background jobs at a non-overlapping interval.

MSMQ background job processing is by default performed every 10 minutes starting at zero minutes past the hour. To prevent multiple gateway instances simultaneously attempting to perform cleanup on the queues when running in load-balanced configuration, a setting called cleanup-delay should be specified on each gateway instance. The recommended value to use for this on each machine is (10 / instanceCount) * (instanceNumber - 1) where instanceNumber is an integer value 1..n.

For example, a cluster of 2 machines would use cleanup-delay of 0 on machine 1, 5 on machine 2. A cluster of 3 machines would use cleanup-delay of 0 on machine 1, 3 on machine 2, and 6 on machine 3. Machine clocks should be synchronized by NTP or equivalent mechanism to ensure this offset is applied correctly.

The `cleanup-delay` setting is found in the `Mule.SelfHost.config` file:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<appSettings>
    <!-- MSMQ: Delay in minutes to launch the cleanup process for sub-queues -->
    <add key="cleanup-delay" value="0"/>
</appSettings>
----

*Note*: When running in LB configuration the gateway services should be configured to run as 'Administrator' when the nodes involved (MSMQ, gateways) are under a WORKGROUP but not joined to a DOMAIN. When joined to the same DOMAIN the permissions for each of the nodes and objects involved (queues) should be correctly set by the domain's administrator.

See xref:release-notes::connector/msmq-connector-release-notes.adoc[MSMQ Connector Release Notes] for version information.

For more information on the MSMQ connector, see the xref:msmq-connector-user-guide.adoc[MSMQ Connector User Guide].

=== PowerShell Specific

This connector has no specific configuration other than the general configuration regarding the <<Security Considerations>> that are described above.

See xref:release-notes::connector/windows-powershell-release-notes.adoc[MSMQ Connector Release Notes] for version information.

For more information on the PowerShell connector, see the xref:3.9@mule-runtime::windows-powershell-connector-guide.adoc[Windows PowerShell Connector Guide].

== Configuring Dynamics CRM and AX Connector Settings

These connectors have specific service configuration within the `<system.serviceModel>` section of the `Mule.SelfHost.exe.config` configuration file. It is recommended not to modify this section at any circumstance as it contains necessary settings to provide the routing service to the related connectors.

If you want to change the port where the service is provided, you can update the `baseAddress` port number within the URL set there, and register the certificate for SSL as described in the <<Configuring the Anypoint Gateway>> section to complete the change.

The following configuration section affects these connectors:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<system.serviceModel>
    <services>
      <service behaviorConfiguration="routing"
          name="System.ServiceModel.Routing.RoutingService">
        <host>
          <baseAddresses>
            <add baseAddress="https://*:9333/router"/>
          </baseAddresses>
    ...
</system.serviceModel>
----

=== CRM Specific

In addition to the routing service configuration described above at the <<Configuring Dynamics CRM and AX Connector Settings>> section, this connector has specific configuration described below.

==== Configuration settings

In the following table you can find the configuration settings that are only related to the CRM connector:

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|Property |Usage
|*CRM.MaxReceivedMessageSize* |The maximum size, in bytes, for a received message that is processed by the channel connected to Microsoft Dynamics CRM Server (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.basichttpbinding.maxreceivedmessagesize(v=vs.100).aspx[more info]).

== Windows Gateway Service Troubleshooting

The Windows Gateway service leverages the built-in .NET tracing system. The basic premise is simple, tracing messages are sent through switches to listeners, which are tied to a specific storage medium. The listeners for the trace source used by the connector are available in the configuration file:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<sharedListeners>
   <add name="console" type="System.Diagnostics.ConsoleTraceListener" />
   <add name="file" type="System.Diagnostics.TextWriterTraceListener" initializeData="mule.gateway.log" />
   <add name="etw" type="System.Diagnostics.Eventing.EventProviderTraceListener, System.Core, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089" initializeData="{47EA5BF3-802B-4351-9EED-7A96485323AC}" />
</sharedListeners>

<sources>
    <source name="mule.gateway">
        <listeners>
            <clear />
            <add name="console" />
            <add name="etw"/>
        </listeners>
    </source>
</sources>
----

The previous example configures three listeners for the output console, for files, and for Event Tracing for Windows (ETW). The trace source for the connector `mule.gateway` is configured to output the traces to the console and ETW only.

=== Changing the Tracing Level

The Windows Gateway Services is configured to log *Information* events. This is configured under the `<switches>` element. If you want to log everything, you should use the *Verbose* level, by changing it in the configuration element shown below.

Configure the levels at switch level in the configuration file:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<switches>
    <add name="mule.gateway" value="Information" />
</switches>
----

Other possible levels are:

* *Error*: Output error handling messages
* *Warning*: Output warnings and error handling messages
* *Information*: Output informational messages, warnings, and error handling messages
* *Off*: Disable tracing

If you want to trace or debug the *routing service* within the Windows Gateway Services (for CRM and AX connectors), there is a setting that you can enable to get more details about the error that was generated while hitting the routing service. If you want to get this information at the tracing listeners, then you should enable it using the `includeExceptionDetailInFaults` attribute from the `serviceDebug` element. In order to achieve this, you need to set its value to *true* as shown below:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<serviceBehaviors>
  <behavior name="routing">
    ...
    <serviceDebug includeExceptionDetailInFaults="true" />
  </behavior>
</serviceBehaviors>
----

This setting extends the error message returned by the service and adds an internal stack trace of the cause, which in some scenarios may help you understand what the issue or problem is.

=== Console tracing (running from command line)

A useful way to troubleshoot issues is to enable the `console` listener (by default it is, but if not then you should add it to the listeners section shown above), and run the Windows Gateway Services from command line. Within the console you can see real time information which is being traced, like requests, responses and some warnings/errors. These are useful to see if the connector is reaching the Gateway properly, or other possibles causes that could be generating a fault.

To enable the `console` listener, in case it is not, you need to add it to the listeners collection as shown below:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<sources>
    <source name="mule.gateway">
        <listeners>
            <clear />
            <add name="console" />
            ...
        </listeners>
    </source>
</sources>
----

To run from command line, first you need to stop the `Anypoint Gateway` service, and then go to the folder where it is installed (by default `c:\Program Files(x86)\Anypoint Gateway for Windows`) and run the `Mule.SelfHost.exe` application. This starts running a console and displays tracing events within it in real time.

When you are done troubleshooting, you can simply close this console and restart the windows service back again.

=== Event Tracing for Windows

Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) is a very efficient built-in publish and subscribe mechanism for doing event tracing at the kernel level. There is little overhead in using this feature compared to other traditional tracing solutions that rely on I/O for storing the traces in persistence storage such as files or databases. As a built-in mechanism in Windows, many of the operating systems services and components use this feature as well. For that reason, not only can you troubleshoot the application but also many of the OS components involved in the same execution.

In ETW, there are applications publishing events in queues (or providers) and other applications consuming events from those queues in real-time through ETW sessions. When an event is published in a provider, it goes nowhere unless there is a session collecting events on that queue. (The events are not persisted).

The tracing system in .NET includes a trace listener for ETW, `EventProviderTraceListener`, which you can configure with a session identifier, which ETW uses to collect traces:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<sharedListeners>
   <add name="etw"type="System.Diagnostics.Eventing.EventProviderTraceListener, System.Core, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089" initializeData="{47EA5BF3-802B-4351-9EED-7A96485323AC}"/>
</sharedListeners>
----

In the example, the session is associated with this identifier: +
`{47EA5BF3-802B-4351-9EED-7A96485323AC}`

==== Collect Session Traces

To collect session traces:

. Open a Windows console and run this command to start a new session:
+
----
logman start mysession -p {47EA5BF3-802B-4351-9EED-7A96485323AC} -o etwtrace.etl -ets
----
+
. Run this command to stop the session:
+
----
logman stop mysession -ets
----
+
This generates the `etwtrace.etl` file with the tracing session data.
+
. Run this command to generate a human readable file:
+
----
tracerpt etwtrace.etl
----

This command transfers useful information into the `dumpfile.xml` text file. For more information, see http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc732700.aspx[Tracerpt].

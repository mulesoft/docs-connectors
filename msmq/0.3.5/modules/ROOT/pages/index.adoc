*_Standard_*

The MSMQ Connector allows you to send and receive data from MSMQ queues via the Anypoint Gateway for Windows.

After reading this page you should be able to accomplish the following:

* Download and install the MSMQ Connector

* Build a simple example project

* Upload, deploy, and run your project

== Prerequisites

* .NET 4.0 (http://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=17851)
* MSMQ Service (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc730960.aspx)

== Installation and Configuration

=== Installing the Anypoint Gateway for Windows

. Download the Anypoint Gateway for Windows installer from [here]. Unzip the software distribution.
. Double click the `Anypoint-Gateway-Service.exe` file.
. Click the *Options* to change the installation location, or click *Install* to start the installation.
. After the installation completes, the installer gives you the option to view the `readme.txt` file with additional instructions. Click *Finish* to exit.

=== Configuring the Anypoint Gateway for Windows Service

The install location for the Windows Service is `c:\Program Files(x86)\Anypoint Gateway for Windows`. This folder contains the `Mule.SelfHost.exe` executable, the `Mule.SelfHost.exe.config` configuration file and PowerShell scripts to automate configuration tasks.

[NOTE]
If the configuration file doesn't appear in the folder, in Windows 7, when the control panel *View by* option is set to *Small icons*, click *Control Panel > Folder Options > View > Show hidden files, folders, and drives*.

The executable starts a new web server at port 9000, which only accepts secure connections using HTTPS. You can change the port number and the authentication token for the gateway in the `Mule.SelfHost.exe.config` configuration file:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<appSettings>
    <!-- Configure the service to listen on the following address. -->
    <add key="OwinHostAddress" value="https://+:9000/"/>
    <!-- Token that must be sent by the Mule connector's client in the Authorization header when accessing the Rest Api. -->
    <add key="mule-auth-token" value="3nGdw7W+G1fSO2YBEHDmpo4N1Tg="/>
</appSettings>
----

This web server uses a self-signed SSL certificate auto-generated during installation. The certificate is in the *Personal* folder on the *Local Computer* certificate store:

image::mmc-personal-certs.png[MMC_Personal_Certs]

Because the Windows service relies on `http.sys` for self-hosting the web server, any change in the port number or SSL certificate requires reconfiguring Windows. The `Register-SslCert.ps1` PowerShell script in the installation directory handles this task. If the port or certificate changes, run the following command from a [Powershell] console:

`Register-SslCert.ps1 <certificate-thumbprint> <windows-account> <port>`

* `<certificate-thumbprint>`: The thumbprint of the SSL certificate. It must be stored in the Personal Folder of the Local Store Account.

* `<windows-account>`: Windows User or Group that receives permissions to register the port. The account impersonating the Windows service or console application must be part of this group.

* `<port>`: HTTP port

*Example*:
`Register-SslCert.ps1 a495cbf8c4af496f1ef81efb224c8097d039f922 everyone 9001`

== Example

This example requires some basic familiarity with with Mule ESB. The following documentation describes the Mule ESB features in this example:

* xref:3.5@mule-runtime::mule-expression-language-mel.adoc[Mule Expression Language (MEL)]
* link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.4/configuring-endpoints[Configuring Endpoints]
* xref:3.5@mule-runtime::mule-transformers.adoc[Mule Transformers]
* xref:3.5@mule-runtime::flow-reference-component-reference.adoc[Flow Reference Component Reference]
* xref:msmq-connector-user-guide.adoc[MSMQ Connector User Guide]

== Setup Demo Queue in MSMQ

=== Step 1: Create Queue

image::mmc-privatequeues.png[MMC_PrivateQueues]

. Open the Computer Management console on the server where MSMQ is running.
. Expand *Services and Applications*.
. Expand *Message Queuing*.
. Right-click *Private Queues*, click *New*, and *Private Queue*.
. Name the new queue *msmq-demo*, and click *Ok*.

=== Step 2: Grant Permissions

Set the appropriate permissions for the identity that the MSMQ Connector uses to interact with the queue.

. Right click the *msmq-demoqueue* and click properties.

. Select the Security Tab. For this demo, make sure that “Everyone” has permissions to the following:
+
* Receive Message
* Peek Message
* Get Properties
* Get Permissions
* Send Message
+

== Setting Up a Mule Project

=== Step 1: Create a New Mule Project

After Anypoint Studio launches, create a new project:

. Go to *File > New > Mule Project*.
. In the *New Mule Project* configuration menu, provide a name for this project: *msmq-demo*.
. Click *Finish*.

=== Step 2: Create a MSMQ Global Element

. Click *Global Elements* tab.
. Click *Create* to display the Global Type dialog box.
. Filter by *msmq*.
. Select *MSMQ* from *Cloud Connectors* section and click *OK*.
. Fill in *Gateway Service Address* using the format `machinename/ip address : port`. (For example, `localhost:9000`). Don't use URLs as they are not supported.
. Fill in *Gateway Access Token*. You can find the configured token in the Windows Service configuration file (`c:\Program Files(x86)\Anypoint Gateway for Windows\Mule.SelfHost.exe.config`) under the *mule-auth-token* appSetting key.
. Fill in the *Queue name* using the supported syntax by *MSMQ*. For example, `.\private$\msmq-demo` for the private queue created above. Because the required permissions have been granted to “Everyone,” you do not need to specify a UserName and Password for this demo.
. If you are using a self-signed SSL certificate such as the one included out of the box, make sure *Ignore SSL Warnings* is checked.
. Click *Test Connection* to make sure everything was set up correctly.
. Click *OK*.

== Building Flows

The sample flows send and receive messages from an existing queue. Transformers put the necessary information on the Mule Message for subsequent operations to consume. The end result looks like this:

image::buildingflows.png[BuildingFlows]

=== Step 1: Building the "Send" Flow

. Filter the Palette by *http* and drag and drop an *HTTP Endpoint* in the canvas. This creates a new flow `“msmq-demoFlow1”`.
. Filter the Palette by *payload* and drag a *Set Payload Transformer* next to the *HTTP Endpoint*.
. Filter the Palette by *logger* and drag a *Logger Component* next to the *Set Payload*.
. Filter the Palette by *msmq* and drag a *MSMQ Connector* next to the *Logger*.
. Double-click *HTTP Endpoint*. After its properties dialog displays, select one-way from the *Exchange Patterns* group. Make sure *Host* is set to `localhost` and the *Port* is set to `8081`. Save the changes.
. Double-click *Set Payload Transformer*. After its properties dialog displays, set *Value* to `#[header:INBOUND:http.relative.path]`, and save the changes.
. Double-click *Logger Component*. After its properties dialog displays, set *Message* to `Sending message: #[payload]`, and save the changes.
. Double-click *MSMQ Connector*. After its properties dialog displays, select the *Config Reference* named MSMQ. Leave the rest of the fields with the default values, and save the changes.

=== Step 2: Building the "Receive" Flow

. Filter the Palette by *msmq* and drag a *MSMQ Connector* to the canvas, outside of the existing flow `“msmq-demoFlow1”`. This creates a new flow `msmq-demoFlow2`.
. Filter the Palette by *byte* and drag a *Byte Array To String Transformer* next to the *MSMQ Connector*.
. Filter the Palette by *logger* and place a *Logger Component* next to the *Byte Array To String Transformer*.
. Double-click *MSMQ Connector*. After its properties dialog displays, select the *Config Reference* named MSMQ , and leave the rest of the properties with the default values. Save the changes.
. Double-click the *Logger Component*. After its properties dialog displays, set *Message* to `Received from queue: #[payload]`, and save the changes.

=== Step 3: Running the Flows

. Right-click *msmq-demo.mflow* and click *Run As > Mule Application*.
. Check the console to see when the application starts. You should see a message Started app `'msmq-demo'` message if no errors occurred.

+ Started app 'msmq-demo'                                  +
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
----
+
. Access the endpoint at `+http://localhost:8081/Hello-World+` and check the operation payload.
. The following messages should display in the console.
+
[source,text,linenums]

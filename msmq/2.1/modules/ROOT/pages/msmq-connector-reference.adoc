= Microsoft MSMQ Connector Reference - Mule 4
:page-aliases: connectors::msmq/msmq-connector-reference.adoc


Anypoint Connector for Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) (MSMQ Connector) uses a typical client-server architecture with two tiers, the connector or client running in the Mule Runtime, and the Windows Gateway running on the server side. The latter exposes an HTTP Web API for sending or receiving messages from MSMQ.

== Before You Begin

Ensure you have the following:

* Java 8, 11, or 17
* Anypoint Studio 7.5 and later
* Mule runtime engine (Mule) 4.3.0 and later
* DataWeave

== MSMQ Receiver Configuration

=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | |x
| Connection a| Msmq
 | The connection Types that can be provided to this configuration. | |x
| Message Count a| Number |  |  |x
| Polling Frequency a| Number |  The polling frequency in milliseconds to pull messages out of the gateway. |  |x
| Message Formatter a| Enumeration, one of:

** None
** ActiveXMessageFormatter |  The MSMQ message formatter to use to encode or decode messages. |  |x
| Message Delivery a| Enumeration, one of:

** NoAcknowledgement
** AtLeastOnce |  The message delivery mode when receiving messages from the Gateway. |  |
| Expiration Policy a| ExpirationPolicy |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration.

:page-aliases: 3.8@mule-runtime::salesforce-analytics-cloud-connector.adoc

Anypoint Connector for Salesforce Einstein Analytics lets you connect to the Salesforce Analytics Cloud application using https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.bi_dev_guide_ext_data.meta/bi_dev_guide_ext_data/[External Data API]. The connector exposes convenient methods for creating and populating data sets into Salesforce Analytics Cloud system. Load data into Analytics Cloud from many different data sources whether they are on-premise or on the cloud. Go beyond .csv files with this connector.

Read through this User Guide to understand how to set up and configure a basic integration flow using the connector. Read through the http://mulesoft.github.io/mule3-salesforce-analytics-connector/[Technical Reference] to understand how the connector operations tie in with the External Data API calls.

*Release Notes*: xref:release-notes::connector/salesforce-analytics-cloud-connector-release-notes.adoc[Salesforce Analytics Cloud Connector Release Notes].

== Before You Begin

This document assumes you are familiar with Mule, Anypoint Connectors, and Anypoint Studio.

== Requirements

To use the Salesforce Analytics Cloud connector, you need to use the Salesforce Analytics Cloud connector, you must have a Salesforce account and necessary permissions for uploading data into analytics cloud. For more information see https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.bi_dev_guide_ext_data.meta/bi_dev_guide_ext_data/[Analytics Cloud External Data API Developer's Guide].


== Compatibility

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Application/Service |Version
|Mule Runtime | 3.5.0 and higher
|External Data API | 36.0
|===

== Installing and Configuring

=== Installing

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio taskbar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange.
. Search for the connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

=== Using the Connector in a New Project

To use the Salesforce Analytics Cloud connector in a Mule application project:

. In Studio, select File > New > Mule Project.
. Enter a name for your new project and leave the remaining options with their default values.
. If you plan to use Git, select *Create a .gitignore file* for the project with default .gitignore settings for Studio Projects, and then click *Next*.
. Click *Finish* to create the project.

=== Configuring the Salesforce Analytics Cloud Global Element

To use the Salesforce Analytics Cloud connector in your Mule application, you must configure a global Salesforce Analytics Cloud element that can be used by all the Salesforce Analytics Cloud connectors in the application (read more about xref:3.8@mule-runtime::global-elements.adoc[global elements]).

=== Salesforce Analytics Cloud Connector Authentication

To access the data in a Salesforce Analytics Cloud instance, you have the following possibilities in terms of authentication:

* Basic authentication
* OAuth 2.0 Web Flow
* OAuth 2.0 JWT Bearer
* OAuth 2.0 SAML Bearer

Basic authentication is the easiest to implement. All you need to do is provide your credentials in a global configuration, then reference the global configuration in any Salesforce Analytics Cloud connector in your application. Basic authentication is generally recommended for internal applications. Implementing OAuth 2.0-related authentication mechanisms, on the other hand, involves a few extra steps, but may be preferred if your service is exposed to external users, as it ensures better security. More technical information on these authentication mechanisms at the following links: https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_calls_login.htm[Basic Auth], https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=remoteaccess_oauth_web_server_flow.htm&language=en_US[OAuth 2.0 Web Flow], https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=remoteaccess_oauth_SAML_bearer_flow.htm&language=en_US[OAuth 2.0 SAML Bearer] and https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=remoteaccess_oauth_jwt_flow.htm[OAuth 2.0 JWT Bearer].

. Click the *Global Elements* tab at the base of the canvas.
. On the Global Mule Configuration Elements screen, click *Create*.
. In the Choose Global Type wizard, filter by "salesforce analytics", expand *Connector Configuration*, and then select one of the four available configurations depending on your needs.
+

NOTE: In the image above, the placeholder values refer to a configuration file placed in the *src* folder of your project (Learn how to xref:3.8@mule-runtime::configuring-properties.adoc[configure properties]). You can either hardcode your credentials into the global configuration properties, or reference a configuration file that contains these values. For simpler maintenance and better re-usability of your project, Mule recommends that you use a configuration file. Keeping these values in a separate file is useful if you need to deploy to different environments, such as production, development, and QA, where your access credentials differ. See xref:3.8@mule-runtime::deploying-to-multiple-environments.adoc[Deploying to Multiple Environments] for instructions on how to manage this.

[NOTE]
===============================
. Go to your Mule workspace, and open the command prompt (for Windows) or Terminal (for Mac).
. Type `keytool -genkeypair -alias salesforce-cert -keyalg RSA -keystore salesforce-cert.jks` and press enter.
. Enter the following details:
.. Password for the key store.
.. Your first name and last name.
.. Your organization unit.
.. Name of your City, State, and the two letters code of your county.
. The system generates a java keystore file containing a private/public key pair in your workspace. You need to provide a file path for the Keystore in your connector configuration.
. Type `keytool -exportcert -alias salesforce-cert -file salesforce-cert.crt -keystore salesforce-cert.jks` and press enter.
. The system now exports the public key from keystore into the workspace. This is the public key that you need to enter in your Salesforce instance.

=== Using the Connector

You can use the Salesforce Analytics Cloud connector as an outbound connector in your flow to push data into Salesforce Analytics Cloud system. To use it as an outbound connector, simply place the connector in your flow at any point after an inbound endpoint. Note that you can also use the Salesforce Analytics Cloud connector in a batch process to push data to Salesforce Analytics Cloud system in batches.

=== Use cases

The following are the common use cases for the Salesforce Analytics Cloud connector:

. Create a data set in the Salesforce Analytics Cloud system, upload data into the data set from an input file, and trigger the system to start processing the data. Use this when dealing with smaller files, preferably less than 10 MB.
. Create a data set in the Salesforce Analytics Cloud system, read the data from an input file and split it into batches, upload batches of data into the data set, and trigger the system to start processing the data. We recommend ingesting huge volumes of Data using this approach. Make sure that your batch commit size is less than or equal to 10 MB for optimal performance. The connector throws a warning if the batch commit size is greater than 10 MB.

==== Adding the Salesforce Analytics Cloud Connector to a Flow

. Create a new Mule project in Anypoint Studio.
. Drag the Salesforce Analytics Cloud connector onto the canvas, then select it to open the properties editor.
. Configure the connector's parameters:

[discrete.view]
=== Studio Visual Editor

[discrete]
==== Example Use Case 1

Create a dataset and upload data into it by processing all the data in one big chunk.

Create a new Mule Project by clicking on *File > New > Mule Project*. In the new project dialog box, the only thing you are required to enter is the name of the project. Click on *Finish*.

image::new-project-dialog.png[New project dialog]

Now let's create the flow. Navigate through the project's structure and double-click on *src/main/app/project-name.xml* and follow the steps below:

. On the right side of studio search for *File*.
+
image::search-for-file.png[Search for File]
. Drag the *File* element onto the canvas.
. Search for *DataMapper* and drag it after *File*.
. Search for *Salesforce Analytics Cloud* and drag it after *DataMapper*.

. Let's start configuring each element. Double-click on the *File* element.
+
image::file-component.jpg[File component]
. Click on `...` next to the *Path* field.
. Choose a folder with only the csv file that you want to upload. You can download our example file and save it into chosen folder.
+
link:{attachmentsdir}/CsvDemoTestData.csv[CsvDemoTestData.csv]
. Double-click on *Salesforce Analytics Cloud* connector.
. Click on the plus sign next to the *Connector configuration* dropdown.
+
image::create-data-set-config.jpg[Create data set config]
. A pop-up appears asking for type of configuration. Choose *Salesforce Analytics Cloud: Basic Authentication* option and click *OK*.
. A new pop-up appears asking for information required for basic authentication. For more info see the <<Installing and Configuring, Installing and Configuring>> section
+
image::basic-authentication-config.png[Basic Auth config]
. In the *Connection* section enter the credentials used to access the Salesforce instance.
. In the *DataSense metadata* section for the *Metadata file name* field enter the filename that describes the data structure you are going to upload. The filename has to be relative to the *src/main/resources* directory of your Studio project. For the file provided a few steps earlier (CsvDemoTestData.csv) you can use the metadata file provided below but do not forget to copy it into the *src/main/resources* directory.
+
link:{attachmentsdir}/metadata.json[metadata.json]
. Click *OK* to return to the Salesforce Analytics Cloud tab.
. From the *Operation* dropdown in the *Basic Settings* section choose *Upload external data into new data set and start processing*.
. From the *Operation* dropdown in the *DataSet info* section choose *OVERWRITE*.
. In the *Description* enter *Test data set*.
. In the *Label* field under *DataSet info* enter *Test data set*.
. In the *Name* field under *DataSet info* enter *test_data_set*.
. Double-click on the *DataMapper* element.
. Click on the *Type* dropdown in the Input section and choose *CSV*

image::dm-mappings.png[Data mapper mappings]
. Now everything is set up and the application can be deployed.

It's time to test the app. Run the app in Anypoint Studio (Right-click on project name > *Run as > Mule Application*). Monitor the studio console and check Salesforce Wave Analytics UI to see if the data was uploaded.

[discrete]
===== Example Use Case 2

Create a dataset and upload data into it by processing the data in several chunks.

[NOTE]
When using the batch component tune it based on the amount of memory that you provide to the Mule ESB server.
If you use DataMapper, be sure that streaming is enabled, in order to avoid load the entire input in memory.
Bear in mind that default threading profile uses 16 threads and each thread is loading data in chunks of 100 records until it reaches the "Commit size" set on "Batch Commit" component.
You can minimize the memory used by decreasing the number of threads.
Finally you have to be aware of the fact that "Salesforce Analytics Cloud Connector" is also using some memory internally and you should tune "Commit Size" in order to find a good balance but do not set it too low because this will make it inefficient.

Create a new Mule Project by clicking on *File > New > Mule Project*. In the new project dialog box, the only thing you are required to enter is the name of the project. Click *Finish*.

image::new-project-dialog.png[New project dialog]

Now let's create the flow. Navigate through the project's structure and double click on *src/main/app/project-name.xml* and follow the steps below:

. On the right side of Studio search for *Batch*.
+
image::search-for-batch.jpg[Search for batch]

= LDAP Connector 3.5 - Mule 4




Anypoint Connector for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a public standard that facilitates maintenance and access to distributed directories (such as network user privilege information) over an Internet Protocol (IP) network.

LDAP Connector supports both LDAP over SSL and LDAP over TLS.

Many LDAP servers are included in free-use open source projects and packages. The particulars of installing, running, and configuring LDAP servers fall outside the scope of this document.

For information about compatibility and fixed issues, see the LDAP Connector Release Notes.

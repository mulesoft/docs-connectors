Anypoint Connector for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a public standard that facilitates maintenance and access to distributed directories (such as network user privilege information) over an Internet Protocol (IP) network.

LDAP Connector supports both LDAP over SSL and LDAP over TLS.

= Use Anypoint Studio to Configure LDAP Connector 3.2 - Mule 4

Anypoint Studio (Studio) editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.

To add and configure a connector in Studio:

. <<create-mule-project,Create a Mule project>>.
. <<add-connector-to-project,Add the connector to your Mule project>>.
. <<configure-source,Configure a source for the connector's flow>>.
. <<add-connector-operation,Add a connector operation to the flow>>.
. <<configure-global-element,Configure a global element for the connector>>.
. <<configure-other-fields,Configure the other connector fields>>.

When you run the connector, you can view the app log to check for problems in real time, as described in <<view-app-log,View the App Log>>.

If you are new to configuring connectors in Studio, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-config-use-studio.adoc[Use Studio to Configure a Connector]. If, after reading this topic, you need additional information about the connector fields, see the xref:ldap-connector-reference.adoc[LDAP Connector Reference].

[[create-mule-project]]
== Create a Mule Project

In Studio, create a new Mule project in which to add and configure the connector:

. In Studio, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
. Enter a name for your Mule project and click *Finish*.

[[add-connector-to-project]]
== Add the Connector to Your Mule Project

Add LDAP Connector to your Mule project to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location and add the required dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file:

. In *Mule Palette*, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Dependencies to Project*, type `ldap` in the search field.
. Click *LDAP Connector* in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.

[[configure-source]]
== Configure a Source

A source initiates a flow when a specified condition is met.
You can configure one of these sources to use with <Connector name> Connector:


* On Modified Objects
+
Initiates a flow when an LSDAP data object is modified
+
* On New Objects
+
Initiates a flow when a new LDAP data object is created
+
* HTTP Listener
+
Initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port
+
* Scheduler
+
Initiates a flow when a time-based condition is met

////
Use one input source as an example. If the connector has a connector-specific input source, use one of those input sources as an example. In the example, list the required and important fields.  If the connector does not have a connector-specific input source, use HTTP Listener, using the text shown below.
////

// Text for using HTTP Listener source

For example, to configure an HTTP Listener source, follow these steps:

. In *Mule Palette*, select *HTTP > Listener*.
. Drag *Listener* to the Studio canvas.
. On the *Listener* configuration screen, optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. Specify a value for the *Path* field.
. Click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of the HTTP Listener source in the app.
. On the *General* tab, specify connection information for the connector.
. On the *TLS* tab, optionally specify the TLS information for the connector.
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

[[add-connector-operation]]
== Add a Connector Operation to the Flow

When you add a connector operation to your flow, you are specifying an action for that connector to perform.

To add an operation for LDAP Connector, follow these steps:

. In *Mule Palette*, select *<Connector name>* and then select the desired operation.
. Drag the operation onto the Studio canvas, next to the input source.

[[configure-global-element]]
== Configure a Global Element for the Connector

When you configure a connector, configure a global element that all instances of that connector in the app can use. Configuring a global element requires you to provide the authentication credentials that the connector requires to access the target LDAP system. LDAP Connector supports <mention the types of authorization the connector supports>.

To configure the global element for LDAP Connector, follow these steps:

. Select the operation in the Studio canvas.
. In the *General* configuration screen for the operation, click the *Add* icon (image:add-icon.png[2%,2%]) to access the global element configuration fields.
. In the *General* tab, in *Connection*, select the authentication method to configure:
* Basic
* SSL
* TLS
+
. Complete the following fields:
+
[%header,cols=30s,70a]
|===
|Field |User Action
|Principal DN |Distinguished name (DN) of the user
|Password | Password of the user
|Authentication | Authentication method to use. The default is `Simple`.
|URL | Connection URL to the LDAP server
+
You can reference a configuration file that contains ANT-style property placeholders (recommended), or you can enter your authorization credentials in the global configuration properties. For information about the benefits of using property placeholders and how to configure them, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-connector-configuration-overview.adoc[Anypoint Connector Configuration].
+
. In the *Pooling* tab, keep the default entries.
+
This tab is available only for Basic configuration.
+
. In the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.



The following image shows an example of configuring Role authentication:

image::<image>.png[*Role* is selected in the *Connection* section and authentication fields are completed in the *General* tab.]

The first item shows where to specify that the connector will use Role authentication. The second item shows the *General tab*, which contains fields related to Role authentication.
////

[[configure-other-fields]]
== Configure Additional Connector Fields

After you configure a global element for LDAP Connector, configure the the other required fields for the connector. The required fields vary depending on which connector operation you use.

[[view-app-log]]
== View the App Log

To check for problems, you can view the app log as follows:

* If you’re running the app from Anypoint Platform, the app log output goes to the Anypoint Studio console window.
* If you’re running the app using Mule from the command line, the app log output goes to your operating system console.

Unless the log file path is customized in the app’s log file (`log4j2.xml`), you can also access the app log in the default location `MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`. You can configure the location of the log path in the app log file `log4j2.xml`.

== Next Step

See xref:connector-template-files-connector-config-topics.adoc[Additional Configuration Information] for more configuration steps.




[[config]]
== Configure the LDAP Connector Global Element

To use LDAP Connector in a Mule application, you must configure a global LDAP configuration element that can be used by as many LDAP Connectors as you require for your application. This connector supports server side pooling for Basic configuration, which can be configured in the Pooling section.

. Click the *Global Elements* tab at the base of the canvas.
. On the Global Configuration Elements screen, click *Create*. +
The following window appears:
+
image::ldap-config-global-wizard.png[Global Element Configuration Wizard]
+
. In the Choose Global Type wizard, expand *Connector Configuration*, select *LDAP Configuration*, and click *OK*. +
The following window appears:
+
image::ldap-configs.png[Global Element Properties]
+
. Choose Basic configuration or TLS configuration from the drop-down list and configure its properties.
+
[%header,cols="30a,70a",width=80%]
|===
|Parameter|Description
|Name| Name by which to reference the connector
|Principal DN|The DN (distinguished name) of the user
|Password|The password of the user
|Authentication|Specifies the authentication mechanism to use. The default is `Simple`.
|URL|The connection URL to the LDAP server
|===
+
In the image above, the placeholder values refer to a configuration file `mule-artifact.properties` placed in the `src/main/resources` folder of your project.
 You can either enter your credentials into the global configuration properties, or reference a configuration file that contains these values.

 Although you can hard-code your credentials into the global configuration properties, you can simplify maintenance and achieve better project reusability if you reference a configuration file that contains these values instead. Keeping these values in a separate file is useful if you need to deploy to different environments in which your access credentials differ (such as production, development, and QA).

. In the Advanced and Pooling tabs, keep the default entries. +
The Pooling tab is only available for Basic configuration.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that the parameters of your global configuration are accurate, and that Mule is able to successfully connect to your instance of LDAP server.
. Click *OK* to save the global connector configuration.

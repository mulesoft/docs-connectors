= Using Anypoint Studio to Configure SAP S/4HANA OData Connector 2.3 

Anypoint Studio (Studio) editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.

To add and configure a connector in Studio:

. <<create-mule-project,Create a Mule project>>.
. <<add-connector-to-project,Add the connector to your Mule project>>.
. <<configure-input-source,Configure an input source for the connector's flow>>.
. <<add-connector-operation,Add a connector operation to the flow>>.
. <<configure-global-element,Configure a global element for the connector>>.


If you are new to configuring connectors in Studio, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-config-use-studio.adoc[Using Anypoint Studio to Configure a Connector]. If, after reading this topic, you need additional information about the connector fields, see the xref:sap-s4hana-cloud-connector-reference.adoc[SAP S/4HANA OData Connector Reference].

[[create-mule-project]]
== Create a Mule Project

In Anypoint Studio, create a new Mule project in which to add and configure the connector:

. From the Studio main menu, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
. Enter a name for your Mule project and click *Finish*.

[[add-connector-to-project]]
== Add the Connector to Your Mule Project

Add Anypoint Connector for SAP S/4HANA OData to a Mule project to automatically populate the project's XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location, as well as to add the required dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file.

. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Dependencies to Project*, type `sap s/4hana odata` in the search field.
. Click the connector name in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.

[[configure-input-source]]
== Configure a Source

A source initiates a flow when a specified condition is met. The act of dragging the connector's operation from the palette onto the Anypoint Studio canvas automatically populates the XML code with the connector namespace and schema location.

Possible source operations for this connector are:

* HTTP Listener +
Starts your app using a browser or a command such as `curl`
* Scheduler +
Starts your app at timed intervals

In Studio, drag the input operation you choose from the *Mule Palette* to the *Source* panel in the canvas, and supply the required parameters.

[[add-connector-operation]]
== Add a Connector Operation to the Flow

When you add a connector operation to your flow, you immediately define a specific operation for that connector to perform.

To add an operation for SAP S/4HANA OData Connector, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *SAP S/4HANA OData* and then select the desired operation.
. Drag the operation onto the Studio canvas to the right of the input source.

[[configure-global-element]]
== Global Configuration Elements

To use SAP S/4HANA OData Connector in a Mule app, configure a connector global element for connector operations to use in your application.

You can put placeholder values in the `mule-artifact.content` configuration file in the `src/main/resources` folder of your project.

You can either enter your credentials in the global configuration content or
reference a configuration file that contains the values for your credentials.
Using a configuration file is recommended for simpler maintenance and better reuse of your project. Keeping these values in a separate file is useful if you need to deploy to different environments, such as production, development, and QA, where access credentials might differ.

For more information, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-connector-configuration-overview.adoc#property-placeholders[Use Property Placeholders for Property Values].

=== Configure a Global Element

Use the *Global Element Properties* configuration dialog to configure a global element for SAP S/4HANA OData Connector:

. In your project, click the *Global Elements* tab at the base of the canvas.
. In the *Global Configuration Elements* screen, click *Create*:
+
image::sap-hana-global-config-wizard.png[]
+
. In the *Choose Global Type* wizard, expand *Connector Configuration*, select *SAP S 4HANA Config*, and click *OK*.
. Configure the following values in the *General* tab:
.. In the *Connection* drop-down menu, select the connection type:
  * *Basic authentication* +
  For basic authentication, enter the following required values:
  ** *Service Base URL* +
  The URL of the SAP S/4HANA instance you want to manage
  ** *Username* +
  The user name used to initialize the session
  ** *Password* +
  The password used to authenticate the user
  * *OAuth 2 Application Connection Provider* +
  For OAuth 2.0 authentication, enter the following required information:
  ** *Service base URL* +
  The base URL of the service provider of the SAP S/4HANA system to access from the connector. All other endpoints are derived from this base URL.
  ** *Client ID* +
  The OAuth client ID that is registered with the service provider
  ** *Client secret* +
  The OAuth client secret that corresponds to the client ID and is registered with the service provider.
  ** *Token URL* +
  Token URL that corresponds to the URL of the endpoint that provides the access tokens
.. Click *OK*.
. Click *Test Connection* to ensure that your access credentials are correct.
. Click the *Advanced* tab inside the *Connection* section to configure the following values:
+
[%header,cols="30s,70a"]

|Studio Field |Description
|Discovery Service Enabled |Feature switch for service discovery. If disabled, the service discovery relative path is not applied.
|Discovery Service Path | Relative path from the base URL to the service to use for automatic services discovery.
|Service directory |Common HTTP directory for all SAP services. You can leave this parameter blank and then specify the HTTP directory individually for every service in the unlisted services list.
|Unlisted services |List of services to add to the list of discovered services.
|Service discovery resolution timeout | Connection timeout for service discovery.
|Service discovery timeout unit | Time unit to use in the service discovery resolution timeout configuration.
|Default headers |Custom headers that can be included in each request sent.
|Default query parameter |Custom query parameters to include in each request sent.
|TLS configuration |TLS configuration.
|Proxy configuration |Configuration for executing requests through a proxy.
|Connection timeout |Connection timeout for the request.
|Connection timeout unit |Connection timeout unit for the request.

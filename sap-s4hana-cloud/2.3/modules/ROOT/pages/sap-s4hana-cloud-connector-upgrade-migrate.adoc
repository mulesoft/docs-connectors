== Requirements and Limitations

Be aware of the following requirements and limitations before you upgrade to the latest version.

=== Requirements

You must use Mule 4.2.1 or later.

=== Limitations

This upgrade breaks backward compatibility with 1.x.x versions of the connector.

== Upgrade Prerequisites

Before you upgrade, create a backup of your files, data, and configurations in case you need to restore to them.

== Upgrade Steps

Follow these steps to perform the upgrade:

. In Anypoint Studio, create a Mule project.
. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Dependencies to Project*, enter `sap s/4hana odata` in the search field.
. In *Available modules*, select *SAP S/4HANA OData Connector* and click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.
. Verify that the `mule-sap-s4hana-cloud-connector` dependency version is updated to the version of the connector you are using in the `pom.xml` file in the Mule project.

Studio upgrades the connector automatically.

== Post Upgrade Steps

After you install the latest version of the connector, verify the upgrade:

. In Studio, verify that there are no errors in the *Problems* or *Console* views.
. Verify that there are no problems in the project `pom.xml` file.
. Test the connection and verify that the operations work.

== Troubleshooting

If there are problems with caching the parameters and metadata, try restarting Studio.

== Revert the Upgrade

If it is necessary to revert to the previous version of SAP S/4HANA OData Connector, change the `mule-sap-s4hana-cloud-connector` dependency version in the project’s `pom.xml` to the version to which you want to revert.

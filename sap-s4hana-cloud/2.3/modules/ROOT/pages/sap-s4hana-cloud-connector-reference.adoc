|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x

 | The connection types to provide to this configuration. | | x
| Time Zone a| String |  The timezone with which to convert the Date objects returned from S/4HANA. |  UTC |
| Batch Buffer Size a| Number |  Defines the maximum memory the connector will use to keep batch requests in memory. If more than the specified maximum memory is consumed the connector starts to buffer the content on disk. | 512 |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE

|===

== Connection Types

[[Config_BasicAuthentication]]
=== Basic Authentication

Basic authentication is the simplest way of enforcing access controls because it does not require cookies, session identifiers, or login pages. Instead, it uses standard fields in the HTTP header, which removes the need for handshakes. This mechanism provides no confidentiality protection for the transmitted credentials. The credentials are encoded with Base64 in transit, but not encrypted or hashed in any other way.

==== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Service base URL a| String |  The base URL of the SAP S/4HANA instance to access from the connector and from which all other endpoints are derived. |  | x

| Unlisted services a| Array of String |  List of services to add to the list of discovered services. Each item in this list must be a valid service URL, or it must be possible to construct a valid service URL with the following format: `{base url parameter}/{service directory parameter}/{item from this list}`. |  |

== What's Changed

=== 2.6

The connector now supports custom namespaces. To support custom namespaces, the connector now includes the new *Scoped service discovery relative path* and *Services attributes* fields in the connection types and the new *Service Attribute* type.

Use custom namespaces to define and organize custom objects and developments, such as programs, function modules, or tables. The naming convention for a custom namespace is `Z` or `Y` followed by an identifier. For example, if there are custom programs that manage customer data, you can create a custom namespace called `ZCUST` to organize all custom programs related to customer data. 

Custom namespaces enable you to maintain better control over your custom objects and developments and avoid naming conflicts with SAP standard objects or custom objects by other organizations, as well as improve the maintainability and upgradability of the system.

=== 2.5

You can now use the new *Batch Upsert Custom Business Object* operation and the modified *Batch update entity* operation to support custom business objects.

=== 2.4

Added support for a configurable cache of metadata for S/4HANA services to improve performance by not executing a metadata request in every operation call.

=== 2.3

Added support to enable or disable the automatic retrieval of a CSRF token before a resource-modifying request, such as a POST request.

=== 2.2

You can now configure the response, client, and connection timeout parameters.

== 2.1

SAP S/4HANA OData Connector now provides support for the OData APIs exposed by SAP S/4HANA S/4HANA on-premise.

== 2.0

* OAuth 2.0 is now supported. +
The *OAuth 2.0 Application Connection Provider* option is added to *Connection* types. For information about the configuration parameters for this connection type, see xref:sap-s4hana-cloud-connector-reference.adoc[SAP S/4HANA OData Connector Reference].
* Mule runtime engine (Mule) 4.2.1 or later is required.
* The default value for the *Service directory* field was removed.
* Because the base package has changed, all exported classes now have different fully qualified names.
* The group ID of the connector’s JAR has changed.

== Requirements and Limitations

Be aware of the following requirements and limitations before you upgrade to the latest version.

=== Requirements

You must use Mule 4.2.1 or later.

=== Limitations

This upgrade breaks backward compatibility with 1.x.x versions of the connector.

== Upgrade Prerequisites

Before you upgrade, create a backup of your files, data, and configurations in case you need to restore to them.

== Upgrade Steps

Follow these steps to perform the upgrade:

. In Anypoint Studio, create a Mule project.
. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Dependencies to Project*, enter `sap s/4hana odata` in the search field.
. In *Available modules*, select *SAP S/4HANA OData Connector* and click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.
. Verify that the `mule-sap-s4hana-cloud-connector` dependency version is updated to the version of the connector you are using in the `pom.xml` file in the Mule project.

Studio upgrades the connector automatically.

== Post Upgrade Steps

After you install the latest version of the connector, verify the upgrade:

. In Studio, verify that there are no errors in the *Problems* or *Console* views.
. Verify that there are no problems in the project `pom.xml` file.
. Test the connection and verify that the operations work.

== Troubleshooting

If there are problems with caching the parameters and metadata, try restarting Studio.

== Revert the Upgrade

If it is necessary to revert to the previous version of SAP S/4HANA OData Connector, change the `mule-sap-s4hana-cloud-connector` dependency version in the project’s `pom.xml` to the version to which you want to revert.

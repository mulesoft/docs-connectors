[[Config]]
== Default Configuration


==== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x
| Connection a| * <<Config_BasicAuthentication, Basic Authentication>>
* <<Config_Oauth2ClientCredentialsAuthentication, Oauth2 Client Credentials Authentication>>
 | The connection types to provide to this configuration. | | x
| Time Zone a| String |  The timezone with which the Date objects returned from S/4Hana will be converted. |  UTC |
| Batch Buffer Size a| Number |  Defines the maximum memory the connector will use to keep batch requests in memory. If more than that is consumed it will start to buffer the content on disk. |  512 |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB |  The unit in which batchBufferSize size is expressed. |  KB |
| Encoding a| String |  |  |
| Name a| String |  The identifier of this element used to reference it in other components |  | x
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform expires the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime purges the instances when it sees fit. |  |
|===

== Connection Types

[[Config_BasicAuthentication]]
=== Basic Authentication

Basic authentication is the simplest way of enforcing access controls because it does not require cookies, session identifiers, or login pages. Instead, it uses standard fields in the HTTP header, which removes the need for handshakes. This mechanism provides no confidentiality protection for the transmitted credentials. The credentials are merely encoded with Base64 in transit, but not encrypted or hashed in any way.

====== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Service base URL a| String |  The base URL of the SAP S/4HANA service to access from the connector. All other endpoints are derived from this base URL. |  | x
| Username a| String |  The account username with which to log into SAP S/4HANA. |  | x
| Password a| String |  The account password with which to log into SAP S/4HANA. |  | x
| Discovery Service Enabled a| Boolean |  Feature switch for service discovery. If disabled, the service discovery relative path is not applied. | `true` |
| Service discovery relative path a| String |  URL to use for automatic services discovery. |  sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=0002/ServiceCollection |
| Service directory a| String |  Common HTTP directory for all SAP services. You can leave this parameter blank and specify the HTTP directory individually for every service in the unlisted services list. |   |
| Unlisted services a| Array of String |  List of services to add to the list of discovered services. If the `Service directory` parameter is not specified, then the HTTP directory needs to be prepended before every service name in this list, in the following format: {directory}/{service-name}. |  |
| Default headers a| Array of <<DefaultHeader>> |  Default HTTP headers to include in the message. |  |
| Default query parameters a| Array of <<DefaultQueryParam>> |  Default query parameters to include in the request. |  |
| Proxy configuration a| <<ProxyConfiguration>> | Proxy configuration for the connector. |  |
| TLS configuration a| <<Tls>> | Protocol to use for communication. Valid values are `HTTP` and `HTTPS`. When using HTTPS the HTTP communication is secured using TLS or SSL. If HTTPS was configured as the protocol then you must configure at least the keystore in the `tls:context` child element of this `listener-config`. | `HTTP` |
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to `true`, deployment fails if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy. |  |

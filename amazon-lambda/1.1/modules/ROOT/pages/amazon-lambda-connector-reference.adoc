[[Create20150331FunctionsInvocationsByFunctionName]]
== Invoke
`<amazon-lambda:create20150331-functions-invocations-by-function-name>`


Invokes a Lambda function. You can invoke a function synchronously (and wait for the response), or asynchronously. 

To invoke a function asynchronously, set `InvocationType` to `Event`. 

For synchronous invocation, details about the function response, including errors, are included in the response body and headers. For either invocation type, you can find more information in the execution log and trace. 

When an error occurs, your function may be invoked multiple times. Retry behavior varies by error type, client, event source, and invocation type. For example, if you invoke a function asynchronously and it returns an error, Lambda executes the function up to two more times. For more information, see Retry Behavior. 

For asynchronous invocation, Lambda adds events to a queue before sending them to your function. If your function does not have enough capacity to keep up with the queue, events may be lost. Occasionally, your function might receive the same event multiple times, even if no error occurs. 

To retain events that were not processed, configure your function with a dead-letter queue. The status code in the API response doesn't reflect function errors. Error codes are reserved for errors that prevent your function from executing, such as permissions errors, limit errors, or issues with your function's code and configuration. For example, Lambda returns `TooManyRequestsException` if executing the function causes you to exceed a concurrency limit at either the account level (`ConcurrentInvocationLimitExceeded`) or function level (`ReservedFunctionConcurrentInvocationLimitExceeded`). 

For functions with a long timeout, your client might be disconnected during synchronous invocation while it waits for a response. Configure your HTTP client, SDK, firewall, proxy, or operating system to allow for long connections with timeout or keep-alive settings. 

This operation requires permission for the lambda:InvokeFunction action. 

This operation makes an HTTP POST request to the `/2015-03-31/functions/{FunctionName}/invocations` endpoint.

[[Get20150331Functions]]
== List Functions
`<amazon-lambda:get20150331-functions>`


Returns a list of Lambda functions, with the version-specific configuration of each function. Lambda returns up to 50 functions per call. Set `FunctionVersion` to `ALL` to include all published versions of each function in addition to the unpublished version. The ListFunctions action returns a subset of the FunctionConfiguration fields. 

To get the additional fields (State, StateReasonCode, StateReason, LastUpdateStatus, LastUpdateStatusReason, LastUpdateStatusReasonCode) for a function or version, use GetFunction. 

This operation makes an HTTP GET request to the `/2015-03-31/functions` endpoint.

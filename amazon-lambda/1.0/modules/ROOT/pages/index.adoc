Support Category: https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#anypoint-connectors[Select]

Anypoint Connector for Amazon Lambda (Amazon Lambda Connector) enables you to execute AWS Lambda operations within your Mule flows. You can then use the response of the Lambda operation to process another Mule flow as needed.

For compatibility information and fixed issues, see the Amazon Lambda Release Notes.

== Prerequisites

To use this connector, you must be familiar with:

* The AWS Lambda API
* Anypoint Connectors
* Mule runtime engine (Mule)
* Elements and global elements in a Mule flow
* Creating a Mule app using Anypoint Studio (Studio)

Before creating an app, you must have:

* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) access key credentials 
* Access to the AWS Lambda target resource
* Anypoint Studio version 7.3 or later

== Common Use Case for the Connector

When your app manages large amounts of streaming data from various sources, Amazon Lambda Connector enables you to send the data stream to an AWS Lambda application that is specifically designed to quickly pull and process the required information. This enables you to manage necessary realtime tasks without slowing down your main application.

== Authentication Types

AWS Lambda Connector supports AWS Lambda authentication.

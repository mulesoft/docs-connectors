== Operations

[[Copy]]
== Copy
`<sftp:copy>`


Copies the file at the sourcePath into the targetPath. If targetPath doesn't exist, and neither does its parent, then an attempt will be made to create depending on the value of the createParentFolder argument. If such argument is , then a SFTP:ILLEGAL_PATH will be thrown. If the target file already exists, then it will be overwritten if the overwrite argument is true. Otherwise, SFTP:FILE_ALREADY_EXISTS error will be thrown. As for the sourcePath, it can either be a file or a directory. If it points to a directory, then it will be copied recursively.

[[Read]]
== Read
`<sftp:read>`


Obtains the content and metadata of a file at a given path. The operation itself returns a Message which payload is a InputStream with the file's content, and the metadata is represent as a SftpFileAttributes object that's placed as the message Message#getAttributes() attributes. If the lock parameter is set to true, then a file system level lock will be placed on the file until the input stream this operation returns is closed or fully consumed. Because the lock is actually provided by the host file system, its behavior might change depending on the mounted drive and the operation system on which mule is running. Take that into consideration before blindly relying on this lock. This method also makes a best effort to determine the mime type of the file being read. The file's extension will be used to make an educated guess on the file's mime type. The user also has the chance to force the output encoding and mimeType through the outputEncoding and outputMimeType optional parameters.

== Sources

[[Listener]]
== On New or Updated File
`<sftp:listener>`


Polls a directory looking for files that have been created on it. One message will be generated for each file that is found. The key part of this functionality is how to determine that a file is actually new. There're three strategies for that: Set the autoDelete parameter to true: This will delete each processed file after it has been processed, causing all files obtained in the next poll to be necessarily new Set moveToDirectory parameter: This will move each processed file to a different directory after it has been processed, achieving the same effect as autoDelete but without loosing the file Use the watermarkMode parameter to only pick files that have been created/updated after the last poll was executed. A matcher can also be used for additional filtering of files.


=== Parameters

| Time Between Size Check a| Number |  Wait time in milliseconds between size checks to determine if a file is ready to be read. This allows a file write to complete before processing. You can disable this feature by omitting a value. When enabled, Mule performs two size checks waiting the specified time between calls. If both checks return the same value, the file is ready to be read. |  | {nbsp}
| Time Between Size Check Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

| Apply Post Action When Failed a| Boolean |  Whether any of the post actions (autoDelete and moveToDirectory) should also be applied in case the file failed to be processed. If set to false, no failed files will be moved nor deleted. |  true | {nbsp}

 Defaults to MILLISECONDS | MILLISECONDS | 
| Case Sensitive a| Boolean | Enables you to configure an external file system matcher as case sensitive or insensitive. | true | 
| Filename Pattern a| String | A matching pattern to be applied on the file name. This pattern needs to be consistent with the rules of
 org.mule.extension.sftp.api.matcher.PathMatcherPredicate |  | 
| Path Pattern a| String | A matching pattern to be applied on the file path. This pattern needs to be consistent with the rules of
 org.mule.extension.sftp.api.matcher.PathMatcherPredicate |  | 
| Directories a| Enumeration, one of:

** REQUIRE
** INCLUDE
** EXCLUDE | If false, the predicate will only accept
 files which are not directories. If not set, then the criteria doesn't apply. | INCLUDE | 
| Regular Files a| Enumeration, one of:

** REQUIRE
** INCLUDE
** EXCLUDE | If false, the
 predicate will only accept files which are directories or symbolic links. If not set, then the criteria doesn't apply. | INCLUDE | 
| Sym Links a| Enumeration, one of:

** REQUIRE
** INCLUDE
** EXCLUDE | If false, the predicate will only
 accept files which are symbolic links. If not set, then the criteria doesn't apply. | INCLUDE | 
| Min Size a| Number | The minimum file size in bytes. Files smaller than this are rejected |  | 
| Max Size a| Number | The maximum file size in bytes. Files larger than this are rejected |  |

[[RepeatableInMemoryStream]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Stream

[cols=".^20%,.^25%,.^30%,.^15%,.^10%", options="header"]
|======================
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | This is the amount of memory that will be allocated in order to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can be fit into this buffer, then it will be expanded by according to the bufferSizeIncrement attribute, with an upper limit of maxInMemorySize. |  | 
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This is by how much will be buffer size by expanded if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower will mean that the buffer should not expand, meaning that a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error will be raised when the buffer gets full. |  | 
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | This is the maximum amount of memory that will be used. If more than that is used then a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error will be raised. A value lower or equal to zero means no limit. |  | 
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which all these attributes are expressed |  | 
|======================

[[RepeatableFileStoreStream]]
=== Repeatable File Store Stream

[cols=".^20%,.^25%,.^30%,.^15%,.^10%", options="header"]
|======================
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| In Memory Size a| Number | Defines the maximum memory that the stream should use to keep data in memory. If more than that is consumed then it will start to buffer the content on disk. |  | 
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which maxInMemorySize is expressed |  | 
|======================

[[RedeliveryPolicy]]
=== Redelivery Policy

[cols=".^20%,.^25%,.^30%,.^15%,.^10%", options="header"]
|======================
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Redelivery Count a| Number | The maximum number of times a message can be redelivered and processed unsuccessfully before triggering process-failed-message |  | 
| Message Digest Algorithm a| String | The secure hashing algorithm to use. If not set, the default is SHA-256. |  | 
| Message Identifier a| <<RedeliveryPolicyMessageIdentifier>> | Defines which strategy is used to identify the messages. |  | 
| Object Store a| ObjectStore | The object store where the redelivery counter for each message is going to be stored. |  | 
|======================

[[RedeliveryPolicyMessageIdentifier]]
=== Redelivery Policy Message Identifier

[cols=".^20%,.^25%,.^30%,.^15%,.^10%", options="header"]
|======================
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Use Secure Hash a| Boolean | Whether to use a secure hash algorithm to identify a redelivered message |  | 
| Id Expression a| String | Defines one or more expressions to use to determine when a message has been redelivered. This property may only be set if useSecureHash is false. |  |

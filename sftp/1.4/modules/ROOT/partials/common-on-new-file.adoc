Anypoint Connectors for File, FTP, and SFTP provide an *On New or Updated File* operation that polls a directory for files that have been created or updated. A message is generated for each file that is found.

The following strategies determine that a file is new:

* Set the *Auto delete* field to *True* to delete each file after it is processed, which causes all files obtained in the next poll to be necessarily new.
* Set the *Move to directory* field to move each file to a different directory after it is processed, which achieves the same effect as Auto delete but without losing the file.
* Set the *Watermark* field to pick only files that have been created or updated after the last poll was executed.

You can also use a matcher for additional filtering of files.

== Repeatable Streams
//INCLUDED IN THE FILE, FTP, AND SFTP DOCS.

The *List* operation makes use of the repeatable streams functionality introduced in Mule 4. The operation returns a list of messages, where each message represents a file in the list and holds a stream to the file. A stream is repeatable by default.

For more information on this topic, see xref:mule-runtime::streaming-about.adoc[Streaming in Mule 4].

= Create a Directory Using SFTP Connector Example - Mule 4

Anypoint Connector for SFTP (SFTP Connector) provides a *Create directory* operation that enables you to create a directory of a given name.

If the reason for creating the directory is to immediately write, copy, or move content to the directory, then use the *Write*, *Copy*, or *Move* operations with the *Create parent directories* field set to *TRUE*.

== Configure the Create Directory Operation in Studio

To add and configure the *Create directory* operation in Studio, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, search for `sftp` and select the *Create directory* operation.
. Drag the *Create directory* operation onto the Studio canvas.
. In the *General* tab of the operation configuration screen, click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to access the global element configuration fields.
. Specify the connection information and click *OK*.
. Set the *Directory path* field to the new directory's path name, for example, `~/newFolder`.

The following screenshot shows the *Create directory* operation configuration:

= Read a File Using the SFTP Connector Example - Mule 4
:page-aliases: connectors::sftp/sftp-read.adoc

Anypoint Connector for SFTP (SFTP Connector) can read a file at any point in the flow. The *Read* operation reads the file in the given path and returns a Mule message with the following attributes:

* The file's content as the payload
* The file's metadata in the message attributes
* If the file does not exist, you receive an `SFTP:ILLEGAL_PATH` error
+
Note that the operation does not read directories.

== Configure the Read Operation in Studio

To add and configure the *Read* operation in Studio, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, search for `sftp` and select the *Read* operation.
. Drag the *Read* operation onto the Studio canvas.
. In the *General* tab of the operation configuration screen, click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to access the global element configuration fields.
. Specify the connection information and click *OK*.
. In the *General* tab, set the *File Path* field to the path of the file to read, for example, `#[path]`.
. In the *Advanced* tab, set the *MIME Type* field to `application/xml` and the *Encoding* field to `ISO 10646/Unicode(UTF-8)`.

The following screenshot shows the *Read* operation configuration:

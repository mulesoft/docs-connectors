|From Version | To Version
|1.6.0 |2.0.0

== Changes in This Release

This release contains the following changes:

* The system property `mule.sftp.useHomeDirectory` was removed. SFTP Connector now uses the default home directory.
* SFTP Connector 2.0.0 no longer supports the `jcraft library`. The connector now uses the `apache mina sshd` library.
* The *List* operation no longer fetches the content of each file. Now, the payload of each list item contains the complete path to the found file or directory. 
* The SFTP *Regular Size* file attribute is renamed to *Regular File* because its behavior is not related to size. The file attribute value can be a file (`true`) or a directory (`false`).
* SFTP Connector 2.0.0 does not support ciphers `3des-ctr` and `arcfour`. For more information, refer to <<supported-ciphers,Supported Ciphers project>>.
* The SFTP proxy protocol works only with HTTP and SOCKS5.
* SFTP Connector no longer uses `javax.activation` to resolve the media types of the files. The connector now uses `Apache Tika`, which can result in different media file interpretations.
* The connector changed the classes to manage the date from `LocalDateTime` to `ZonedDateTime`.
* The deprecated *Encoding* parameter in the configuration and *Write* operation is removed. The connector uses the Mule's default encoding.

== Upgrade Prerequisites

Before you perform the upgrade, you must complete the following:

* Create a backup of your files, data, and configurations in case you need to restore to them. 
// * Do they need to rename or copy over any files before downloading the latest version?

== Upgrade Steps

Follow these steps to perform the upgrade:

. In Anypoint Studio, create a Mule project.
. In *Mule Palette*, click *Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Dependencies to Project*, enter `SFTP` in the search field.
. In *Available modules*, select *SFTP Connector* and click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.
. Verify that the SFTP Connector `mule-sftp-connector` version is `2.0.0` in the `pom.xml` file in the Mule project.

Studio upgrades the connector automatically.

// * Download the current version. 
// * Import data?
// * Update the configuration.
// * What does the user need to do after downloading the connector before they can start using it?

== Post Upgrade Steps

After you install the latest version of the connector, follow these steps to complete the upgrade:

// * Do they need to update endpoints? 
// * Do they need to re-create/refactor any customizations?
// * Does the user need to map any files?
// * Verify the upgrade.

=== Verify the Upgrade

After you install the latest version of the connector, verify the upgrade:

. In Studio, verify that there are no errors in the *Problems* or *Console* views.
. Verify that there are no problems in the project `pom.xml` file.
. Test the connection to verify that the operations work.

[[supported-ciphers]]
== Supported Ciphers 

The Apache Mina SSHD library does not support ciphers `3des-ctr` and `arcfour`. Additionally, the library introduces `aes128-gcm`, `aes256-gcm`, and `cc20p1305_openssh` as alternatives.

= SFTP Connector - Mule 4



Anypoint Connector for SFTP (SFTP Connector) provides access to files and folders on an SFTP server. SFTP connector operations manage file transfers over the SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) protocol. The connector's main features include:

* The ability to read files or list directory contents on demand
* Support for common SFTP operations such as creating directories, copying, moving, renaming, and deleting files
* Support for locking files
* File matching functionality
* A design that is consistent with that of File Connector and FTP Connector
+
The same set of operations is available on these connectors, and they behave similarly.

== Representation of File Attributes

Mule 4 provides a message structure of a payload and attributes in which the data moves around, making that payload a file content. The attributes provide an object that contains metadata on the payload and information such as the file’s name, path, size, and timestamps. For FTP Connector and SFTP Connector, these attributes are known as  _file attributes_.

The Mule message contains the concepts of encoding and MIME type. These describe the format in which a payload is represented. The file attributes describe a file’s encoding and MIME type.

== Before You Begin

To use this connector, you must be familiar with:

* Anypoint Connectors
* Mule runtime engine (Mule)
* Elements and global elements in a Mule flow
* Creating a Mule app using Anypoint Studio (Studio)

Before creating an app, you must have access to Anypoint Platform and Anypoint Studio.


== Next Step

After you complete the prerequisites, you are ready to create your own app and configure the connector using xref:sftp-studio.adoc[Anypoint Studio].

//INCLUDED IN file-write, ftp-write, and sftp-write adoc files

When writing content to a file, set the *Write Mode* parameter to any of the following modes:

* *OVERWRITE (Default)* +
If the file exists, overwrite it completely.
* *APPEND* +
 If the file exists, add its content to the end of an existing file.
* *CREATE_NEW* +
Create a new file. If the file already exists, then you receive an error.

== Locks

The Write operation supports locking similar to the Read operation. The main difference is that the lock releases automatically after the Write operation finishes. Set the *Lock* parameter to any of the following modes:

* *TRUE*
* *FALSE (Default)*

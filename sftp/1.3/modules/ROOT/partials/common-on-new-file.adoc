Anypoint Connectors for File, FTP, and SFTP provide an On New or Updated File operation that polls a directory for files that have been created or updated. A message is generated for each file that is found.

The following strategies determine that a file is new:

* Set the *Auto delete* parameter to `True` to delete each file after it is processed, which causes all files obtained in the next poll to be necessarily new.
* Set the *Move to directory* parameter to move each file to a different directory after it is processed, which achieves the same effect as Auto delete but without losing the file.
* Set the *Watermark* parameter to pick only files that have been created or updated after the last poll was executed.

You can also use a matcher for additional filtering of files.

== MIME Types and Encoding

Each connector determines a file’s MIME type from its extension. However, if first-hand knowledge of the file’s content is necessary, you can force the MIME type to a different value with the MIME Type (`outputMimeType`) parameter.

The same process works for encoding. By default, the connector assumes that the  default encoding in the Mule runtime engine matches the MIME type of the file. However, you can set the encoding through the Encoding (`outputEncoding`) parameter.

== Why MIME Types Matter

DataWeave expressions are embeddable inside operations that generate payloads and other values. Having the correct MIME Type set helps DataWeave auto-assign types and also generate the correct outputs. Also, maximizing the use of DataSense’s functionality improves the user experience.

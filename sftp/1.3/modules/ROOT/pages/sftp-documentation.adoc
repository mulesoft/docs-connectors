If both checks return the same value, the file is ready to read. This attribute works in tandem with *Time Between Size Check Unit*. |  |
| Time Between Size Check Unit a| Enumeration, is one of:

* NANOSECONDS
* MICROSECONDS
* MILLISECONDS
* SECONDS
* MINUTES
* HOURS
* DAYS |  A TimeUnit that qualifies the *Time Between Size Check* attribute. + Defaults to `MILLISECONDS`. | `MILLISECONDS` |
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform will expire the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. Mule runtime engine purges the instances when it sees it fit. |  |

== Operations

[[copy]]
=== Copy
`<sftp:copy>`

Copies the file or directory specified in *Source Path* into the *Target Path*. The source path can be either a file or a directory. If it points to a directory, then it is copied recursively.

If the target path doesn't exist, and neither does its parent, then a parent folder is created if *Create parent directories* is set to `true`. If *Create parent directories* is set to `false`, then an `SFTP:ILLEGAL_PATH` error is thrown.

If *Overwrite* is set to `true` and the target file already exists, then the target file is overwritten. Otherwise, an `SFTP:FILE_ALREADY_EXISTS` error is thrown.

* SFTP:CONNECTIVITY


[[read]]
=== Read
`<sftp:read>`


Obtains the content and metadata of a file at a given path. The operation itself returns a message whose payload is an input stream with the file's content, and the metadata is represented as an `SftpFileAttributes` object that's placed as the message `Message#getAttributes()` attributes.

If the lock parameter is set to `true`, then a file system level lock is placed on the file until the input stream this operation returns is closed or fully consumed. Because the lock is provided by the host file system, its behavior might change depending on the mounted drive and the operation system on which Mule is running. Take that into consideration before relying on this lock.

This method also makes a best effort to determine the MIME type of the file being read by using the file's extension to make an educated guess. You can also use the output *Encoding* and output *MIME Type* optional parameters to force the encoding and MIME type.

[[write]]
=== Write
`<sftp:write>`


Writes the content into the file the path points to.

If the directory to which the file is attempting to be written doesn't exist, then the operation will either throw an `SFTP:ILLEGAL_PATH` error, or create a new folder, depending on the value of *Create parent directories*. If the file already exists, then the behavior depends on the supplied mode.

This operation also supports locking depending on the value of the lock argument, and follows the same rules and considerations as described in the read operation.

== Sources

[[listener]]
=== On New or Updated File
`<sftp:listener>`

Polls a directory and looks for files that have been created in it. One message is generated for each file that is found.

The key part of this functionality is how to determine that a file is actually new. There are three strategies for that:

* Set the *Auto delete* parameter to `true` to delete each file after it is processed, which causes all files obtained in the next poll to be necessarily new.
* Set the *Move to directory* parameter to move each file to a different directory after it is processed, which achieves the same effect as *Auto delete* but without losing the file.
* Use *Watermark enabled* to pick only files that have been created or updated after the last poll was executed.

You can also use a matcher for additional filtering of files.

==== Parameters
[%header,cols="20s,20a,35a,20a,5a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Configuration | String | The name of the configuration to use. | | x
| Directory a| String |  The directory in which polled files are contained. |  |

| Time Between Size Check a| Number |  Wait time (in milliseconds) between size checks to determine if a file is ready to read. This allows a file write to complete before processing. When enabled, Mule performs two size checks, waiting the specified time between calls. If both checks return the same value, the file is ready to read. +
You can disable this feature by omitting a value.  |  |
| Time Between Size Check Unit a| Enumeration is one of:

* NANOSECONDS

| Reconnection Strategy a| * <<reconnect>>
* <<reconnect-forever>> |  A retry strategy in case of connectivity errors. |  |
| Auto Delete a| Boolean |  Whether to delete each file after processing. |  `false` |
| Move To Directory a| String |  If provided, each processed file will be moved to a directory that is pointed to by this path. |  |
| Rename To a| String |  This parameter works in tandem with *Move to directory*. Use this parameter to enter the name of the directory under which to move the file. Do not set this parameter if *Move to directory* hasn't also been set. |  |
| Apply Post Action When Failed a| Boolean |  Specifies whether any of the post actions (*Auto delete* and *Move to directory*) should also be applied in case the file fails to be processed. If set to `false`, no failed files will be moved or deleted. |  `true` |

[[RedeliveryPolicy]]
=== Redelivery Policy

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Redelivery Count a| Number | The maximum number of times a message can be redelivered and processed unsuccessfully before triggering process-failed-message |  |
| Use Secure Hash a| Boolean | Whether to use a secure hash algorithm to identify a redelivered message |  |
| Message Digest Algorithm a| String | The secure hashing algorithm to use. If not set, the default is `SHA-256`. |  |
| Id Expression a| String | Defines one or more expressions to use to determine when a message has been redelivered. This property may only be set if useSecureHash is false. |  |
| Object Store a| <<ObjectStore>> | The object store where the redelivery counter for each message will be stored. |  |

[[repeatable-in-memory-iterable]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Iterable

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | This is the number of instances initially allowed to be kept in memory in order to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can fit into this buffer, then it will be expanded according to the *Buffer size increment* attribute, with an upper limit of *Max in memory size*. Default value is 100 instances. |  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | How much the buffer size will expand if it exceeds its initial specified size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer should not expand, and that a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error will be raised when the buffer gets full. Default value is 100 instances. |  |
| Max in Memory Instances a| Number | This is the maximum amount of memory to use. If more than the maximum amount is used, then a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error will be raised. A value lower or equal to zero means no limit. |  |

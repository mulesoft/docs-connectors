Anypoint Connector for SFTP (SFTP Connector) provides access to files and folders on a SFTP server. SFTP connector operations manage file transfers over the SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) protocol. The connector main features include:

* Read files or list directory contents on demand.
* Support for common SFTP operations such as creating directories, copying, moving, renaming, deleting files.
* Support for locking files.
* File matching functionality.
* Consistent design with the File and FTP Connectors. The same set of operations is available on these connectors, and they behave similarly.

=== Representation of File Attributes

Mule 4 provides a message structure composed of a payload and attributes, where the data moves around. This means that the payload is a file content. The attributes provide an object that contains metadata on the payload and information such as the file’s name, path, size, timestamps, and so on. For the FTP and SFTP connectors these attributes are known as the _file attributes_.

The Mule message contains the concepts of encoding and MIME type. These describe the format in which a payload is represented. The file attributes describe a file’s encoding and MIME type.

== Prerequisites

To use this connector, you must be familiar with:

* Anypoint Connectors
* Mule runtime engine (Mule)
* Elements and global elements in a Mule flow
* Creating a Mule app using Anypoint Studio (Studio)

Before creating an app, you must have access to Anypoint Platform and Anypoint Studio.


== Next Step

After you complete the prerequisites, you are ready to create your own app and configure the connector using xref:sftp-studio.adoc[Anypoint Studio].

= Read a File Using the SFTP Connector Example - Mule 4


Anypoint Connector for SFTP (SFTP Connector) provides a *Read* operation that reads a file at any point in the flow. The operation reads the file in the given path and returns a Mule message with the following attributes:

* The file's content as the payload
* The file's metadata in the message attributes
* If the file does not exist, you receive an `SFTP:ILLEGAL_PATH` error
+
Note that the operation does not read directories.

== Configure the Read Operation in Studio

To add and configure the *Read* operation in Studio, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, search for `sftp` and select the *Read* operation.
. Drag the *Read* operation onto the Studio canvas.
. In the *General* tab of the operation configuration screen, click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to access the global element configuration fields.
. Specify the connection information and click *OK*.
. In the *General* tab, set the *File Path* field to the path of the file to read, for example, `#[path]`.
. In the *Advanced* tab, set the *MIME Type* field to `application/xml` and the *Encoding* field to `ISO 10646/Unicode(UTF-8)`.

The following screenshot shows the *Read* operation configuration:

In the XML editor, the `<sftp:read>` configuration looks like this:
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<sftp:read path="#[path]"
  lock="true|false"
  outputEncoding="UTF-8"
  outputMimeType="application/xml" />

== Transactions Per Second

The following table compares the total requests per second (TPS) and average success TPS for the *Read* operation of the SFTP Connector versions:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Connector version |Mule runtime engine version|Total requests for v1.6.1 |Total requests for v2.0.1 |Average success TPS for v1.6.1 |Average success TPS for v2.0.0 | Percentage of decreased TPS performance
|1.6.1 vs 2.0.0  | 4.4.1  | 301,377.40  | 247,614.40 | 1,674 | 1,375.60 | -18
|1.6.1 vs 2.0.0  | 4.5.0 | 326,915.80  | 247,296.20 | 1,816 | 1,374 | -24

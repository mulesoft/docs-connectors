= Using Anypoint Studio to Configure NetSuite Connector

== Add the Connector to a Studio Project

Anypoint Studio provides two ways to add the connector to your Studio project: from the Exchange button in the Studio taskbar or from the Mule Palette view.

=== Add the Connector Using Exchange

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. Click the Exchange icon *(X)* in the upper-left of the Studio task bar.
. In Exchange, click *Login* and supply your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. In Exchange, search for "netsuite".
. Select the connector and click *Add to project*.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

=== Add the Connector in Studio

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. In the Mule Palette view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Modules to Project*, type "netsuite" in the search field.
. Click this connector's name in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

=== Configure in Studio

. Drag a connector operation to the Studio Canvas.
. Select an authentication mechanism listed on the Global connector configuration. It can be one of the followings:
+
[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Configuration |Description
|Login Authentication |Makes use of the SuiteTalk's login API call on the first request sent by the connector to establish a session with NetSuite.
|Request Based Authentication |Using this strategy, you can send user credentials in the SOAP header of each request instead of authenticating to NetSuite by invoking login.
|Single Sign-On Authentication |This is a token based authentication system that avoids the use of environment username and password. Here you supply a privateKey together with other information. The connector is then responsible for generating an authentication token and establishing a session with NetSuite via the `ssoLogin` API call on the first request.
|Token Authentication |Similar to Single Sign-On Login Authentication, this is a token based authentication system. However, instead of using a privateKey generated via openssl, this uses a consumer and token key/secret pairs which are established within the NetSuite environment.
|===
+
. Configure these fields according your selection:
.. Login Authentication
+

|Parameter |Description
|Name |Enter a name for the configuration with which to reference it later.
|Email |Enter the login email of the NetSuite UI.
|Password |Enter the corresponding password to log into NetSuite UI.
|Account |Enter the account ID of the SuiteTalk NetSuite web services. This is usually found within NetSuite sandbox UI under Setup > Integration > Web Service Preferences.
|Role Id |Enter the role ID for the user in SuiteTalk, which determines the Processor privileges.
|Application Id |Enter the application ID corresponding to the Integration record to be used.
|===

.. Request Based Authentication

+
[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Parameter |Description

|Company ID |Enter the company ID used in the mapping process for the connector to generate a token.
|User ID |Enter the user ID used in the mapping process for the connector to generate a token.
|Key File |Enter the privateKey file name to pick up from the project. This file should be the .der file generated as per NetSuiteâ€™s specifications. This is used to encrypt the company ID and user ID into a token for ssoLogin.
|Application Id |Enter the application ID corresponding to the Integration record to be used.
|===
+
.. Token Authentication
+
image::netsuite-token-studio.png[request based authentication]

|Parameter |Description
|Consumer Key |Enter the consumer key value for the token based authentication enabled integration record being used.
|Consumer Secret |Enter the consumer secret value for the token based authentication enabled integration record being used.
|Token ID |Enter the token ID representing the unique combination of a user and integration generated within the NetSuite environment.
|Token Secret |Enter the respective token secret for the user/integration pair.
|Account |Enter the account ID of the SuiteTalk NetSuite web services. This is usually found within NetSuite sandbox UI under Set Up > Integration > Web Service Preferences.
|Signature algorithm | Type of HMAC signature algorithm

== Use Case: Call NetSuite RESTlet

This use case shows how to call RESTlets that are deployed in NetSuite instances.

By following these instructions, you can:

* Create a customer record.
* Retrieve a customer record.
* Delete a record.

=== Before You Begin

* Java 8
* Anypoint Studio 7.0.x
* Mule Runtime 4.0.x EE
* DataWeave 2.0
* Access to a NetSuite instance with credentials in the `mule-app.properties` file

=== Deploy a Script as a RESTlet

. Create a sample JavaScript script:
+
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
// Get a standard NetSuite record
function getRecord(datain)
{
    return nlapiLoadRecord(datain.recordtype, datain.id);
    // for example, recordtype="customer", id="769"
}

// Create a standard NetSuite record

function createRecord(datain)
{
    var err = new Object();

    // Validate if mandatory record type is set in the request
    if (!datain.recordtype)
    {
        err.status = "failed";
        err.message= "missing recordtype";
        return err;
    }

    var record = nlapiCreateRecord(datain.recordtype);

    for (var fieldname in datain)
    {
      if (datain.hasOwnProperty(fieldname))
      {
        if (fieldname != 'recordtype' && fieldname != 'id')
        {
          var value = datain[fieldname];
            if (value && typeof value != 'object')
            // ignore other type of parameters
            {
              record.setFieldValue(fieldname, value);
            }
        }
      }
    }
    var recordId = nlapiSubmitRecord(record);
    nlapiLogExecution('DEBUG','id='+recordId);
    var nlobj = nlapiLoadRecord(datain.recordtype,recordId);
    return nlobj;
}

// Delete a standard NetSuite record
function deleteRecord(datain)
{
  nlapiDeleteRecord(datain.recordtype, datain.id);
  // for example: recordtype="customer", id="769"

}
----

. Enable SuiteScript and web services in your account. Log into NetSuite and click Set Up > Company > Enable Features > SuiteCloud.
+
image::netsuite-enable-suitescript.png[Enable SuiteScript]
+
. Create a new script and upload the file created before. Go to Customization > Scripting > Scripts > New.
. Pick the script file, click Create Script Record, and select RESTlet.
+
image::netsuite-script-type.png[Select Script Type]
+
. Fill out the form using the content of the script you uploaded, and deploy the script.
+
image::netsuite-setup-script.png[Setup Script]
+
. After selecting your audience you see the following page. Take note of the script and deploy numbers in the external URL since you  need them to call the RESTlet.
+

=== Import the Project

* Go to File > Import.
* Select Anypoint Studio Project from External Location under the Anypoint Studio parent folder.
* Provide the root path to the demo project folder.
* Select Mule Runtime (4.1.1) or later.
* Click Finish.
* Configure the credentials, as well as the deployed script and deploy IDs, inside the file `src/main/resources/mule-app.properties`.

. Open the Global Element Configuration.
. Click the Test Connection button to ensure there is connectivity with the sandbox.
+
Test Connection is a crucial step. If you experience connectivity issues, you won't be able to execute any part of this use case, nor make use of DataSense.
+
. A successful message should pop up.
+

+
. Open a browser and access the URL `+http://localhost:8081+`. You should see the application deployed:

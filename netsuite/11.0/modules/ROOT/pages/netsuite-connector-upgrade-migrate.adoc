== Changes in This Release

In the v10.x versions of NetSuite Connector, the connector resolved metadata by receiving Java objects as input and converting them internally to XML so that NetSuite could understand them. In the 11.x version, NetSuite Connector resolves XML metadata directly.

Because of this modification, the input and output metadata for connector operations has changed and is now equivalent to the request and response bodies of the corresponding SOAP API operation, respectively. You can use DataSense explorer in Studio to drag and drop the metadata fields, which causes their corresponding namespaces and tags to be generated automatically.

Version 11.x also eliminates the REST-based operations.

== Upgrade Steps

If you are upgrading from an earlier version of the connector, you can click the `Updates Available` pop-up Message in the bottom right corner of Anypoint Studio and follow the prompts.

You can also follow these steps to perform the upgrade:

. In Anypoint Studio, create a Mule project.
. In *Mule Palette*, click *Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Dependencies to Project*, enter `netsuite` in the search field.
. In *Available modules*, select *NetSuite* and click *Add*. +
Studio upgrades the connector automatically.
. Click *Finish*.
. In the `pom.xml` file for the Mule project, verify that the NetSuite Connector dependency version is `10.0.0`.

== Post Upgrade Tasks

* Ensure that your configurations use either *Request Based* or *Token* authentication.
* Verify that your error handling is updated to work with the minor changes in error codes in this version of the connector.
* Refer to <<changed_operations,Changed Operations>> and <<changed_sources,Changed Sources>> for updated operations and sources. +
If your integration uses any of the affected operations and sources, make the necessary changes to comply with the new interfaces.
* Because the package of the exposed classes was changed to `com.mulesoft.connector.netsuite.extension.api`, you must update all DataWeave mappings that create objects for operation inputs. +
You must also update mappings that transform object outputs.

== Verify the Upgrade

After you install the latest version of the connector, verify the upgrade:

. In Studio, verify that there are no errors in the *Problems* or *Console* views.
. Verify that there are no problems in the project `pom.xml` file.
. Test the connection to verify that the operations work.

== Revert the Upgrade

If you must revert to your previous version of NetSuite Connector, change the `mule-netsuite-connector` dependency version `10.0.0` in the project’s `pom.xml` to the previous version.
Additionally, revert any changes made in the operations to their previous state.

= Using Anypoint Studio to Configure NetSuite Connector 11.2

Anypoint Studio (Studio) editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.

To add and configure a connector in Studio:

. <<create-mule-project,Create a Mule project>>.
. <<add-connector-to-project,Add the connector to your Mule project>>.
. <<configure-input-source,Configure a source for the connector's flow>>.
. <<add-connector-operation,Add a connector operation to the flow>>.
. <<configure-global-element,Configure a global element for the connector>>.
. <<configure-other-fields,Configure the other connector fields>>.

When you run the connector, you can view the app log to check for problems, as described in <<view-app-log,View the App Log>>.

If you are new to configuring connectors in Studio, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-config-use-studio.adoc[Using Anypoint Studio to Configure a Connector]. If, after reading this topic, you need additional information about the connector fields, see the xref:netsuite-reference.adoc[NetSuite Reference].

[[create-mule-project]]
== Create a Mule Project

In Studio, create a new Mule project in which to add and configure the connector:

. In Studio, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
. Enter a name for your Mule project and click *Finish*.

[[add-connector-to-project]]
== Add the Connector to Your Mule Project

Add NetSuite Connector to your Mule project to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location and add the required dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Modules to Project*, type `netsuite` in the search field.
. Click *NetSuite Connector* in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.

[[configure-input-source]]
== Configure a Source

A source initiates a flow when a specified condition is met. You can configure one of these sources to use with NetSuite Connector:

* *HTTP Listener*, which initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port
* *Scheduler*, which initiates a flow when a time-based condition is met

For example, to configure *HTTP Listener*, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *HTTP > Listener*.
. Drag *Listener* to the Studio canvas.
. On the *Listener* configuration screen, optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. Specify a value for the *Path* field.
. Click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of `HTTP Listener` in the app.
. On the *General* tab, specify connection information.
. On the *TLS* tab, optionally specify TLS information.
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specific server.
. Click *OK*.

[[add-connector-operation]]
== Add a Connector Operation to the Flow

When you add a connector operation to your flow, you immediately define a specific operation for that connector to perform.

To add an operation for NetSuite Connector, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *NetSuite* and then select the desired operation.
. Drag the operation onto the Studio canvas to the right of the source.

[[configure-global-element]]
== Configure a Global Element for the Connector

When you configure a connector, it’s best to configure a global element that all instances of that connector in the app can use. Configuring a global element requires you to provide the authentication credentials the connector uses to access the target NetSuite system. NetSuite Connector supports token-based authentication.

To configure the global element for NetSuite Connector, follow these steps:

. Select the name of the connector in the Studio canvas.
. In the configuration screen for the operation, click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to access the global element configuration fields.
. On the *General* tab, configure <<token-authentication,Token Authentication>>, which
authenticates by using either a consumer key and token ID or secret pairs for authentication
+
To configure NetSuite authentication, you must have the account ID for SuiteTalk NetSuite Web Services, which you can find within the NetSuite sandbox UI under *Setup > Integration > Web Service Preferences*.
+
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

=== Token-Based Authentication

With token-based authentication, you authenticate by using either a consumer key and token ID or by using secret pairs, which are established within the NetSuite environment.

The following screenshot shows an example of configuring token-based authentication:

image::netsuite-token-studio.png[request based authentication]

Enter the following information on the *General* tab of the global element configuration screen to configure token-based authentication:

[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|Consumer Key |Consumer key value for the token-based authentication-enabled integration record to use
|Consumer Secret |Consumer secret value for the token-based authentication-enabled integration record to use
|Token ID |Token ID that represents the unique combination of a user and an integration record that is generated within the NetSuite environment
|Token Secret |Respective token secret for the user and an integration record pair
|Account |Account ID for SuiteTalk NetSuite Web Services
|Signature algorithm | Type of hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) signature algorithm
|===

[[view-app-log]]
== View the App Log

To check for problems, you can view the app log as follows:

* If you’re running the app from Anypoint Platform, the output is visible in the Anypoint Studio console window.
* If you’re running the app using Mule from the command line, the app log is visible in your OS console.

Unless the log file path is customized in the app’s log file (`log4j2.xml`), you can also view the app log in the default location `MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`.

== Next Steps

After configuring Studio, see the xref:netsuite-examples.adoc[Examples] topic for more configuration ideas.

= NetSuite Connector 11.2 Reference

Support Category: https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#anypoint-connectors[Select]

Anypoint Connector for NetSuite synchronizes data and automates business processes between NetSuite and third party applications, either on-premises or in the cloud. The connector makes use of the SuiteTalk WSDL to provide SOAP based integration to generate NetSuite business objects, make use of different authentication levels, and support error handling.

[[Config]]
=== Config


==== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x
| Connection a| <<Config_TokenBasedAuthentication, Token-Based Authentication>>
 | The connection types to provide to this configuration. | | x
| Name a| String |  The identifier of this element used to reference it in other components |  | x
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before Mule considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform expires the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. Mule purges the instances as appropriate. |  |
| Show warnings as errors a| Boolean |  When this preference is enabled, warning messages generated by NetSuite are treated as errors that cause an exception, resulting in rejection of the request. |  false |
| Disable mandatory custom field validation a| Boolean a|  This preference affects the handling of custom fields that are configured in the UI to be mandatory:

* If you set this field to `true`, the fields are not treated as required during SOAP web services requests.
* If you set this field to `false`, the fields are required. |  false |
| Disable system notes for custom fields a| Boolean |  System notes are system-generated records that track changes to a record, including changes to specific field values. This preference lets you disable the creation of system notes for changes to custom fields. Depending on your integration, using this preference can increase performance. |  false |
| Ignore read-only fields a| Boolean |  This preference affects the way the system behaves when you mistakenly submit a value for a read-only field. If you set this preference to `true`, the system ignores these mistakes. |  false |
| Run server SuiteScript and trigger workflows a| Boolean a|  Controls SuiteScript and trigger workflows per request:

* If you do not include this preference in a request, the company preference set on the Web Services Preferences page is used.
* If you include this preference in the request, the connector overrides the company preference set in the UI. |  false |
| Customizations Separator a| String |  Separator used to generate the keys required to provided better support for custom fields and records. If the script ID of the customization that defines a custom field or record contains the separator default character, set up a new ID and regenerate the metadata. |  __ |

** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  The time unit for Read Timeout. |  MILLISECONDS |

** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  The time unit for Connection Timeout. |  MILLISECONDS |

| Host a| String |  The hostname of the HTTP proxy, for example, `localhost`. This field requires the port to be set. |  |

| Username a| String |  The username to supply to the HTTP proxy on every request to NetSuite. This field is optional because a user might want to pass through an unauthenticated HTTP proxy. |  |
| Password a| String |  The password to supply to the HTTP proxy on every request to NetSuite. This field is optional because a user might want to pass through an unauthenticated HTTP proxy. |  |
| Non proxied hosts a| String |  A list of comma-separated hosts against which the proxy should not be used |  |
| Consumer Key a| String |  The consumer key value for the enabled token-based authentication integration record |  | x

[[Upsert]]
== Upsert
`<netsuite:upsert>`


Adds a new instance or updates a record instance in NetSuite. This operation is similar to both the Add and Update operations, but you can run Upsert without first determining whether a record exists in NetSuite.

Identify a record by its external ID and its record type. If a record of the specified type with a matching external ID exists in the system, it is updated. If it does not exist, a new record is created. Because the external ID is mandatory for this operation, Upsert is supported only for records that support the external ID field. This operation prohibits the passing of internal ID values.

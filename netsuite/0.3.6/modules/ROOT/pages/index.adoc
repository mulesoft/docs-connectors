*_Select_ *

Anypoint Connector for NetSuite synchronizes data and automates business processes between NetSuite and third party applications, either on-premises or in the cloud.

*Release Notes*: xref:release-notes::connector/netsuite-connector-release-notes.adoc[NetSuite Connector Release Notes]

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule, xref:3.6@mule-runtime::anypoint-connectors.adoc[Anypoint Connectors], and the xref:6@studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio interface]. To increase your familiarity with Studio, consider completing one or more xref:6@studio::basic-studio-tutorial.adoc[Anypoint Studio Tutorials]. Further, this page assumes that you have a basic understanding of xref:3.6@mule-runtime::mule-concepts.adoc[Mule flows] and xref:3.6@mule-runtime::global-elements.adoc[Mule Global Elements].

This document describes implementation examples within the context of Anypoint Studio, Mule ESB’s graphical user interface, and, also includes configuration details for doing the same in the XML Editor.

== Installing the NetSuite Connector in Anypoint Studio

You can install a connector in Anypoint Studio using the instructions in xref:3.6@mule-runtime::installing-connectors.adoc[To Install a Connector from Anypoint Exchange].

== Configuring the NetSuite Connector

To use the NetSuite connector, you must configure:

* A global NetSuite element for use by all the NetSuite connectors in an application.
* Parameters of each NetSuite connector instance in the application.

Follow these steps to configure NetSuite connector in a Mule application:

=== Studio Visual Editor

. Click the *Global Elements* tab at the base of the canvas, then click *Create*.
. In the *Choose Global Type* menu, use the filter to locate and select *NetSuite*, then click *OK*.
. Configure the parameters according to the table below
+

[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|*Name* |Enter a name for the configuration so it can be referenced later.
|*Email* |Enter the login email of the NetSuite UI.
|*Password* |Enter the corresponding password to log into NetSuite UI.
|*Endpoint* a|
Enter the name of the service endpoint.

Ensure that the endpoint you enter here points to the version of NetSuite that the connector supports.

|*Account* |Enter the account ID of the SuiteTalk - NetSuite web services. It looks similar to TSTDRVXXXXXX.
|*RoleId* |Enter the role ID for the user in SuiteTalk, which determines the Processor privileges.
|*Connection Timeout* |Enter the amount of time, in milliseconds, that the client must attempt to establish a connection before timing out. The default is 30000 (30 seconds). Zero (0) indicates that the client continues to attempt to open a connection indefinitely.
|*Receive Timeout* |Enter the amount of time, in milliseconds, that the client must wait for a response before timing out. The default is 60000. Zero (0) specifies that the client waits indefinitely.
|*Enable DataSense* |If you select this option, DataSense extracts metadata for NetSuite standard objects to automatically determine the data type and format that your application must deliver to, or can expect from, NetSuite. By enabling this functionality, Mule does the heavy lifting of discovering the type of data you must send to, or be prepared to receive from NetSuite. For more information, see xref:3.6@mule-runtime::datasense.adoc[DataSense].
|*Default Endpoint* |Enter the default service endpoint.
|*Separator* |Enter the separator used to support the keys that are required to provide a better support for custom fields.
|===
. Access the *Pooling Profile* tab to configure any settings relevant to managing multiple connections via a connection pool.
. Access the *Reconnection* tab to configure any settings relevant to reconnection strategies that Mule should execute if it loses its connection to NetSuite.
. Click *OK* to save the global connector configurations.
. Return to the Message Flow tab in Studio.

==== Configuration in a Flow

Follow these steps to configure the parameters of the NetSuite connector in the flow:

. Drag the NetSuite connector onto the canvas, and double-click it to open the Properties Editor console.
. Configure these parameters for the connector:
+
[%header,cols="34,33,33"]
|===

Field

 a|
Description

 a|
Default

|*Display Name* |Enter a unique label for the connector in your application. |Netsuite
|*Config Reference* |Connect to a global element linked to this connector. Global elements encapsulate reusable data about the connection to the target resource or service. Select the global NetSuite connector element that you just created. |--
|*Operation* |Select the action this component must perform. |--
|===
. Save your configurations.

Ensure that you include the NetSuite namespaces in your configuration file.

Follow these steps to configure a NetSuite connector in your application:

. Create a global NetSuite configuration outside and above your flows, using the following global configuration code:
+

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<!-- Simple configuration -->
<netsuite:config name="Netsuite" email="Your NetSuite email" password="Your NetSuite password" account="Your Netsuite account name" roleId="The id of your NetSuite role" doc:name="Netsuite">
----

. Build your application flow, then add a NetSuite connector using one of these operations:

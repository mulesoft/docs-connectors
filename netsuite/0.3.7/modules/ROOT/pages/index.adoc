MuleSoft's Anypoint™ Connector for NetSuite synchronizes data and automates business processes between NetSuite and third party applications, either on-premises or in the cloud.

*Release Notes*: xref:release-notes::connector/netsuite-connector-release-notes.adoc[NetSuite Connector Release Notes]

== Introduction

NetSuite is the world’s leading provider of cloud-based business management software. NetSuite helps companies manage core business processes with a single, fully integrated system covering ERP/financials, CRM, e-commerce, inventory, and more.

The NetSuite connector makes use of the SuiteTalk WSDL to provide SOAP-based integration and generate NetSuite business objects, make use of different authentication levels, and support error handling.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule, xref:3.7@mule-runtime::anypoint-connectors.adoc[Anypoint™ Connectors], and the xref:5@studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio interface]. To increase your familiarity with Studio, consider completing one or more  xref:5@studio::basic-studio-tutorial.adoc[Anypoint Studio Tutorials]. Further, this page assumes that you have a basic understanding of xref:3.7@mule-runtime::mule-concepts.adoc[Mule flows] and xref:3.7@mule-runtime::global-elements.adoc[Mule Global Elements].

To use this connector, you need a NetSuite account with Web Services Features enabled, and Anypoint Studio installed on your development machine.

== Compatibility

The NetSuite connector v7.1.0 is compatible with:

[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
a|
Application/Service

 a|
Version

|*Mule Runtime* |3.5 and later
|*API* |SuiteTalks 2015_2
|===

== To Install this Connector

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio taskbar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange.
. Search for the connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

When Studio has an update, a message displays in the lower right corner, which you can click to install the update.

However, to use the NetSuite connector in a production environment, you must have either:

* An *Enterprise Mule license*.
* A *CloudHub* Starter, Professional, or Enterprise account.

Contact the https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/contact[MuleSoft Sales Team] to obtain either of these. (Read more about xref:3.7@mule-runtime::installing-an-enterprise-license.adoc[Installing an Enterprise License].)

== Creating a New Project

To use the NetSuite connector in a Mule application project:

. In Studio, click File > MuleNew > Mule Project.
. Enter a name for your new project and leave the remaining options with their default values.
+
image::netsuite-new-mule-project.png[netsuite_new_mule_project]
+
. If you plan to use Git, select *Create a .gitignore file* for the project with default ignores for Studio Projects, and click *Next*.
. Click *Finish* to create the project.

== Configuring the NetSuite Connector Global Element

To use the NetSuite connector in your Mule application, you must configure a global NetSuite element that can be used by all the NetSuite connectors in the application (read more about xref:3.7@mule-runtime::global-elements.adoc[global elements]).

Not much has changed on this front, and as before (starting from v6.0.0) you are presented with a number of different Global Elements, each representing a different way of authenticating to NetSuite, but this release includes a new method of authentication: *NetSuite: Request Level Token Based Authentication*:

[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
|Configuration |Description
|*Login Authentication* |Makes use of the SuiteTalks login API call on the first request sent by the connector to establish a session with NetSuite.
|*Request Level Authentication* |Using this strategy, you can send user credentials in the SOAP header of each request instead of authenticating to NetSuite by invoking login.
|*Single Sign-On Login Authentication* |This is a token based authentication system that avoids the use of environment username and password. Here you supply a privateKey together with other information. The connector is then responsible for generating an authentication token and establishing a session with NetSuite via the `ssoLogin` API call on the first request.
|*Request Level Token Based Authentication* |Similar to Single Sign-On Login Authentication, this is a token based authentication system. However, instead of using a privateKey generated via openssl, this uses a consumer and token key/secret pairs which are established within the NetSuite environment.
|===

Follow these steps to configure NetSuite connector global element in a Mule application:

[.ex]
=====

image::netsuite-global-configuration.png[netsuite_global_configuration]
+
. Click *Ok*.
. Enter global element properties.
.. For *NetSuite: Login Authentication* and *NetSuite: Request Level Authentication*:
+
[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|*Name* |Enter a name for the configuration with which to reference it later.
|*Email* |Enter the login email of the NetSuite UI.
|*Password* |Enter the corresponding password to log into NetSuite UI.
|*Account* |Enter the account ID of the SuiteTalk NetSuite web services. This is usually found within NetSuite sandbox UI under *Setup* > *Integration* > *Web Service Preferences.*
|*Role Id* |Enter the role ID for the user in SuiteTalk, which determines the Processor privileges.
|*Application Id* |Enter the application ID corresponding to the Integration record to be used (*New in NetSuite Connector version 7.0.0*).
|*Connection Timeout* |Enter the amount of time, in milliseconds, that the client must attempt to establish a connection before timing out.
|*Receive Timeout* |Enter the amount of time, in milliseconds, that the client must wait for a response before timing out.
|*Enable DataSense* |If you select this option, DataSense extracts metadata for NetSuite standard objects to automatically determine the data type and format that your application must deliver to, or can expect from, NetSuite. By enabling this functionality, Mule does the heavy lifting of discovering the type of data you must send to, or be prepared to receive from NetSuite. For more information, see xref:5@studio::datasense.adoc[DataSense].
|*Endpoint* a|
Enter the URL of the service endpoint.

[NOTE]
Make sure that the endpoint uses the version of NetSuite that the connector supports.

|*Separator* |Enter the separator used to support the keys that are required to provide a better support for custom fields.
|===
+
.. For *NetSuite: SSO Login Authentication:* +
To use the SSO Login Authentication, enable this feature in your sandbox environment by NetSuite’s Support. NetSuite provides an SSO Kit and information on how to proceed with setting up private and public keys for use in generating authentication tokens. They also provide you with a Partner ID. After this setup is established, a mapping has to be created between the standard NetSuite credentials, the partner ID, company ID, and user ID. A developer or administrator should perform this mapping. It is not handled by the connector and it is only done once for each user ID that is allowed to authenticate using SSO within your company.
+
For this mapping, start by generating a token using the SSO Kit provided by NetSuite. To establish the mapping, invoke the SuiteTalks Web Service API call `mapSso` using an external Java application or any other method of your choice. A sample SOAP request of the `mapSso` API call looks as follows:

== Using the Connector

NetSuite connector is an operation-based connector, which means that when you add the connector to your flow, you need to configure a specific web service operation for the connector to perform. NetSuite connector v7.1.0 supports 50 operations.

=== Adding to a Flow

. Create a new Mule project in Anypoint Studio.
. Add a suitable Mule inbound endpoint, such as the HTTP listener or File endpoint, to begin the flow.
. Drag the NetSuite connector onto the canvas, then select it to open the properties editor.
. Configure the connector's parameters as follows:
+
[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
|Field |Description
|*Display Name* |Enter a unique label for the connector in your application.
|*Config Reference* |Connect to a global element linked to this connector. Global elements encapsulate reusable data about the connection to the target resource or service. Select the global NetSuite connector element you create.
|*Operation* |Select the action this component must perform.
|===

== Custom Field DataSense

In NetSuite one can add different types of custom fields and have these customizations apply to different record types. With DataSense enabled, the NetSuite connector retrieves and shows these fields. Note however that we do not fully support all the customization types that NetSuite users are able to define.
The following lists outline what fields we do and do not handle, and where they currently appear in relation to the record type's attributes. For the most part you can see that customizations are usually present within a list field called _customFieldList_, but in some cases these might reside elsewhere.

== Other Code Examples

=== Working with Asynchronous Operations

This code example demonstrates how to use `async-add-list` together with the `check-async-status`, `get-async-result`, and `delete` operations, using a custom record type.

[NOTE]
====
Note that for this example code to work, you must use a custom record type of your own (or just a regular type), and manually configure the following values of the global NetSuite config to match your instance of NetSuite:

* email
* password
* account
* roleId
* applicationId

*Code Description*

. `netsuite:config-login-authentication` is the NetSuite global configuration.
. The first flow, labeled "asyncAddList" is triggered via an HTTP request.
. `netsuite:async-add-list` provides the configuration for the `async-add-list` operation showing `externalIds` and names we defined for the custom record.
. Store the `jobId` returned from the `async-add-list` operation in a flow variable called "jobId". See `set-variable`.
. Calls a sub-flow named "check_async_status" that monitors the status of the async process.
. The `until-successful` block queries NetSuite using the `check-async-result` operation to see whether the async job is finished or pending/processing. This loops for a number of defined retries and resumes control of the flow after the condition is satisfied.
. A `choice` router directs the message based on whether the async operation finished successfully or not.
. Displays a message in the console notifying that the async process is successful.
. Displays a message in the console if it has failed.
. The second flow is also triggered via an HTTP request, passing the `jobId` as a query parameter.
. Uses the `get-async-result` operation to obtain the result for the async process using the `jobId` that is saved.
. Extracts the response list from the `AsyncResult` object.
. For each result list item, logs some details and delete the record we added.
. Removes the custom records that are just added from the NetSuite sandbox using their `externalId`.


=== Using the Search Operation

In NetSuite, the `search` operation can be used to execute a *Basic Search*, *Joined Search* or an *Advanced Search*. To this end, you need to instantiate one of these three search types for the record type you want to query:

[cols="2*"]
|===
|`<Record>SearchBasic`|Used to execute a search on a record type based on search filter fields that are specific to that type.
|`<Record>Search` +
|Used to execute a search on a record type based on search filter fields specific to that type and others that are associated with a related record type.
|`<Record>SearchAdvanced` +
|Used to execute a search on a record type in which you specify search filter fields and/or search return columns or joined search columns. Using advanced search, you can also return an existing saved search.
|===

This also applies for the asynchronous equivalent of search, the `asyncSearch` operation.

==== Search Pagination Support

Support for pagination was added to `search` for NetSuite connector version 7.0.0.

The connector's search capability is now unified under one operation. Other search-related processors have been removed. Thus, `search` will always retrieve the whole set of results. Therefore users will *not* need to work with `searchNext` or `searchMore` in order to get the rest of the records from subsequent pages. The return type is also different; the processor will output a List of Maps representing each and every record obtained by your search criteria.

An important aspect to note is that pagination could not be applied to the asynchronous equivalent of `search` (`asyncSearch`). This is due to the fact that the actual pagination would have to be applied to the `getAsyncResult` operation. This would mean that only the first page would end up being retrieved asynchronously. Furthermore, `getAsyncResult` is common to all async operations. Hence we cannot even apply pagination here since the return type of this operation depends on what async operation was invoked.

Regarding the new *search* configuration, the connector is the same apart from a new attribute called `fetchSize`:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<netsuite:paged-search config-ref="NetSuite__Login_Authentication" searchRecord="CUSTOMER_BASIC" fetchSize="5" doc:name="Customer Basic Search"/>
----

==== ItemSearchAdvanced and returnSearchColumns

When using `search`, the connector outputs a list of maps representing the Record objects returned by your `search` operation. If using an advanced search and the `returnSearchColumns` flag is set to true, NetSuite returns a `SearchRowList` containing the search results.

However, in the case of `ItemSearchAdvanced` the connector does not do this mapping and simply provides the user with the SearchRows. This is the case due to the fact that ITEMs in NetSuite can be of various types and we cannot assume the item type from an `ItemSearchRow`. This issue would also occur with any other record type that behaves similar to `ITEM`, but we are currently not aware of others.

==== Example of Basic Search

For this example, we set up a basic search operation for Customers (`CustomerSearchBasic`) with the criteria below:

* `companyName` starts with "A".
* The customer is not an individual.
* The customer has a priority of 50, which is handled by a `customField`.

Below is the Studio flow and the corresponding code:

        companyNameFilter.setOperator(SearchStringFieldOperator.STARTS_WITH);
        companyNameFilter.setSearchValue("A");

        searchCriteria.setCustomFieldList(customFieldListFilter);

        return searchCriteria;
    }

==== Example of a Joined Search

This example here searches for all inventory items with a pricing join (ItemSearch) where the price rate is of 10.00. +
The search criteria is set within a custom Java component.

        ItemSearchBasic basicCriteria = new ItemSearchBasic();
        SearchEnumMultiSelectField typeFilter = new SearchEnumMultiSelectField();
        List<String> typeList = new ArrayList<String>();
        typeList.add("_inventoryItem");
        typeFilter.setOperator(SearchEnumMultiSelectFieldOperator.ANY_OF);
        typeFilter.setSearchValue(typeList);
        basicCriteria.setType(typeFilter);
        searchCriteria.setBasic(basicCriteria);

        PricingSearchBasic pricingJoinCriteria = new PricingSearchBasic();
        SearchDoubleField rateFilter = new SearchDoubleField();
        rateFilter.setOperator(SearchDoubleFieldOperator.EQUAL_TO);
        rateFilter.setSearchValue(10.00d);
        pricingJoinCriteria.setRate(rateFilter);
        searchCriteria.setPricingJoin(pricingJoinCriteria);

        return searchCriteria;
    }

}
----

==== Example of Advanced Search

The example constructs a simple Java component that creates a criteria to get the result of an Employee saved search in our NetSuite environment (EmployeeSearchAdvanced). Each saved search in NetSuite has a particular id. Here, we use the scriptId customsearch130.

        searchCriteria.setSavedSearchScriptId("customsearch130");

        return searchCriteria;
    }

}

=== NetSuite and DataWeave

The NetSuite connector’s DataSense capability coupled with that of DataWeave via the Transform Message component makes integrating with your NetSuite environment straightforward. For the following two examples, we use a JSON input string and extract the necessary data from it to form our NetSuite request.

. This example code adds a Journal Entry to NetSuite from the following JSON input:
+

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
   "tranId":"SampleJournal123",
   "subsidiary":{
      "internalId":"1"
   },
   "customFieldList":{
      "customField":[
         {
            "StringCustomFieldRef__custbodytestbodyfield":"Sample Transaction Body Custom Field"
         }
      ]
   },
   "lineList":{
      "line":[
         {
            "account":{
               "internalId":"1"
            },
            "debit":100.0,
            "customFieldList":{
               "customField":[
                  {
                     "SelectCustomFieldRef__custcol_far_trn_relatedasset":{
                         "internalId":"1"
                     }
                  },
                  {
                     "StringCustomFieldRef__custcoltestcolumnfield": "Sample Transaction Column Custom Field 1"
                  }
               ]
            }
         },
         {
            "account":{
               "internalId":"1"
            },
            "credit":100.0,
            "customFieldList":{
               "customField":[
                  {
                     "SelectCustomFieldRef__custcol_far_trn_relatedasset":{
                         "internalId":"2"
                     }
                  },
                  {
                     "StringCustomFieldRef__custcoltestcolumnfield": "Sample Transaction Column Custom Field 2"
                  }
               ]
            }
         }
      ]
   }
}
----

+
The "add" operation for the connector expects a Map as input. The DataWeave script looks as follows:

+
image::netsuite-dataweave1.jpg[netsuite_dataweave1]
+

. In this example, we use the same scenario for basic search as described in the previous section. However, instead of constructing the criteria in a java component, we transform a JSON string:
+

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
   "companyName": {
      "operator": "STARTS_WITH",
      "searchValue": "A"
   },
   "isPerson": false,
   "priority": {
      "operator": "EQUAL_TO",
      "searchValue": 50
   }
}

Support Category: https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#anypoint-connectors[Select]

Anypoint Connector for NetSuite synchronizes data and automates business processes between NetSuite and third party applications, either on-premise or in the cloud. The connector makes use of the SuiteTalk WSDL to provide SOAP based integration to generate NetSuite business objects, make use of different authentication levels, and support error handling.

=== Config

==== Parameters
[%header,cols="20s,20a,35a,20a,5a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x
| Connection a| * <<config_request-based-authentication, Request Based Authentication>>
* <<config_token-authentication, Token Authentication>>
| Connection types to provide to this configuration. | | x
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before Mule considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform expires the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. Mule purges the instances as appropriate. |  |
| Show warnings as errors a| Boolean |  When this preference is enabled, warning messages generated by NetSuite are treated as errors that cause an exception, resulting in rejection of the request. |  false |
| Disable mandatory custom field validation a| Boolean |  This preference affects the handling of custom fields that are configured in the UI to be mandatory. If you set this preference to true, the fields are not treated as required during SOAP web services requests. If the preference is set to false, the fields are required. |  false |
| Disable system notes for custom fields a| Boolean |  System notes are system-generated records that track changes to a record, including changes to specific field values. This preference lets you disable the creation of system notes for changes to custom fields. Depending on your integration, using this preference may increase performance. |  false |
| Ignore read-only fields a| Boolean |  This preference affects the way the system behaves when you mistakenly submit a value for a read-only field. If you set this preference to true, the system ignores these mistakes. |  false |
| Run server SuiteScript and trigger workflows a| Boolean |  By using the runServerSuiteScriptAndTriggerWorkflows preference, you can control SuiteScript and trigger workflows per request. If you do not include this preference in a request, the company preference set on the Web Services Preferences page is used. If you include this preference in the request, it overrides the company preference set in the UI. |  false |
| Send runServerSuiteScript tag in Preferences header a| Boolean |  Send runServerSuiteScript tag in Preferences header |  true |
| Customizations Separator a| String |   Separator used to generate the keys required to provided a better support for custom fields/records.   If the script Id of the customization that defines a custom field/record contains the separator default character, setup a new one and regenerate the metadata.  |  __ |
| Time zone a| String | String associated with the time zone . Enumeration, one of:

All available jobs for each polling period are processed contiguously. There is no enforced waiting period for a job that is available. Once a job is initiated, a job ID is returned in the Web services response. Your client application can then check on the status and result of the request by referencing the job ID.

Note: Asynchronous request JobIDs are valid for 30 days.

[[asyncGetList]]
=== Async Get List
`<netsuite:async-get-list>`

An asynchronous request equivalent to `RecordOperations#getList(NetSuiteSoapConfig, NetSuiteSoapConnection, List)`.

In asynchronous requests, your client application sends a request to the SuiteTalk Platform where it is placed in a processing queue and handled asynchronously with other requests.

All available jobs for each polling period will be processed contiguously. There is no enforced waiting period for a job that is available. Once a job is initiated, a job ID is returned in the Web services response. Your client application can then check on the status and result of the request by referencing the job ID.

Note: Asynchronous request JobIDs are valid for 30 days.

[[upsertList]]
=== Upsert List
`<netsuite:upsert-list>`

Adds or updates one or more instances of a record type in NetSuite.

This operation is similar to both the addList and updateList operations, but upsert can be run without first determining whether records exist in NetSuite.

Records are identified by their external ID and their record type. If a record of the specified type with a matching external ID exists in the system, it is updated. If it does not exist, a new record is created. Because external ID is mandatory for this operation, `upsertList` is supported only for records that support the external ID field. Also, this operation prohibits the passing internal ID values.

[[PoolingProfile]]
=== Pooling Profile

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Active a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can be borrowed from a session at one time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of components that may be active at one time. When maxActive is exceeded, the pool is said to be exhausted. |  |
| Max Idle a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can sit idle in the pool at any time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of Mule components that may be idle at one time. |  |

** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL | Specifies the behavior of the Mule component pool when the pool is exhausted. Possible values are: "WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL", which will throw a NoSuchElementException, "WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT", which will block by invoking Object.wait(long) until a new or idle object is available, or WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW, which will create a new Mule instance and return it, essentially making maxActive meaningless. If a positive maxWait value is supplied, it will block for at most that many milliseconds, after which a NoSuchElementException will be thrown. If maxThreadWait is a negative value, it will block indefinitely. |  |
| Initialisation Policy a| Enumeration, one of:

** INITIALISE_NONE
** INITIALISE_ONE

| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | The amount of instances that is initially be allowed to be kept in memory to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can fit into this buffer, then the buffer expands according to the bufferSizeIncrement attribute, with an upper limit of maxInMemorySize. Default value is 100 instances. |  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This is by how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer should not expand, meaning that a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised when the buffer gets full. Default value is 100 instances. |  |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | The maximum amount of memory to use. If more than that is used then a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised. A value lower than or equal to zero means no limit. |  |

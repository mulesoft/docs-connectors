= NetSuite Connector
:keywords: anypoint studio, connector, endpoint, netsuite
:page-aliases: 3.9@mule-runtime::netsuite-connector.adoc

NetSuite is the world’s leading provider of cloud-based business management software. NetSuite helps companies manage core business processes with a single, fully integrated system covering ERP/financials, CRM, e-commerce, inventory, and more.

The NetSuite connector makes use of the *SuiteTalk WSDL* to provide *SOAP-based integration* and generate NetSuite business objects, make use of different authentication levels, and support error handling. It is also able to perform *REST* calls to *RESTlets* that expose APIs created with *SuiteScript*.

MuleSoft maintains this connector under the xref:3.9@mule-runtime::anypoint-connectors.adoc#connector-categories[_Select_] support policy.

== Prerequisites

To use this connector, you need:

* A NetSuite account with *Web Services Features enabled*.
* Anypoint Studio installed on your development machine.

=== Compatibility

For compatibility details for your version see the release notes.

== Install the Connector

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio taskbar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange.
. Search for the connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

When Studio has an update, a message displays in the lower right corner, which you can click to install the update.

== Configure the Connector Global Element

To use the NetSuite connector in your Mule application, you must configure a global NetSuite element that can be used by all the NetSuite connectors in the application.

This release of the connector lets you pick from a list of four Global Elements, each representing a different way of authenticating to NetSuite:

[%header,cols="40a,60a"]
|===
|Configuration |Description
|*Login Authentication* |Makes use of the SuiteTalk's login API call on the first request sent by the connector to establish a session with NetSuite.
|*Request Level Authentication* |Using this strategy, you can send user credentials in the SOAP header of each request instead of authenticating to NetSuite by invoking login.
|*Single Sign-On Login Authentication* |This is a token based authentication system that avoids the use of environment username and password. Here you supply a privateKey together with other information. The connector is then responsible for generating an authentication token and establishing a session with NetSuite via the `ssoLogin` API call on the first request. *Not available for RESTlet calls.*
|*Request Level Token Based Authentication* |Similar to Single Sign-On Login Authentication, this is a token based authentication system. However, instead of using a privateKey generated via openssl, this uses a consumer and token key/secret pairs which are established within the NetSuite environment. *Available for RESTlet calls with NetSuite Connector v7.7.0.*
|===

Use *Login Authentication* or *Request Level Authentication* if you wish to make RESTlet calls.

Follow these steps to configure NetSuite connector global element in a Mule application:

. Click the *Global Elements* tab at the base of the canvas.
. On the Global Mule Configuration Elements screen, click *Create*.
. In the "Choose Global Type" wizard, expand  *Connector Configuration,* and then select  *NetSuite: Login Authentication, NetSuite: Request Level Authentication,* *NetSuite: SSO Login Authentication,* or *NetSuite: Request Level Token Based Authentication* depending on your NetSuite authentication.
+
image::netsuite-configurations.png[NetSuite Configuration Options]
+
. Click *Ok*.
. Enter global element properties.

The *Endpoint URL* must be defined for all configurations. The hostname is specific to the *Account* ID of the user. The rest of the URL contains the API version. Also note that every connector version *only supports* one version of the SuiteTalk API.

=== Login Authentication and Request Level Authentication

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|Name |Enter a name for the configuration with which to reference it later.
|Email |Enter the login email of the NetSuite UI.
|Password |Enter the corresponding password to log into NetSuite UI.
|Account |Enter the account ID of the SuiteTalk NetSuite web services. This is usually found within NetSuite sandbox UI under Setup > Integration > Web Service Preferences.
|Role Id |Enter the role ID for the user in SuiteTalk, which determines the Processor privileges.
|Application Id |Enter the application ID corresponding to the Integration record to be used.
|Connection Timeout |Enter the amount of time, in milliseconds, that the client must attempt to establish a connection before timing out.
|Receive Timeout |Enter the amount of time, in milliseconds, that the client must wait for a response before timing out.
|Enable DataSense |If you select this option, DataSense extracts metadata for NetSuite standard objects to automatically determine the data type and format that your application must deliver to, or can expect from, NetSuite. By enabling this functionality, Mule does the heavy lifting of discovering the type of data you must send to, or be prepared to receive from NetSuite.
|Endpoint a|
Enter the URL of the service endpoint.

Make sure that the endpoint uses the version of NetSuite that the connector supports.

|Separator |Enter the separator used to support the keys that are required to provide a better support for custom fields.
|===

=== SSO Login Authentication

To use the SSO Login Authentication, enable this feature in your sandbox environment by NetSuite’s Support. NetSuite provides an SSO Kit and information on how to proceed with setting up private and public keys for use in generating authentication tokens. They also provide you with a Partner ID. After this setup is established, a mapping has to be created between the standard NetSuite credentials, the partner ID, company ID, and user ID. A developer or administrator should perform this mapping. It is not handled by the connector and it is only done once for each user ID that is allowed to authenticate using SSO within your company.

For this mapping, start by generating a token using the SSO Kit provided by NetSuite. To establish the mapping, invoke the SuiteTalks Web Service API call `mapSso` using an external Java application or any other method of your choice. A sample SOAP request of the `mapSso` API call looks as follows:

=== Request Level Token Based Authentication

To use this authentication mechanism you will need to set up an Integration Record within NetSuite and enable Token Based Authentication. This will automatically generate a consumer key and secret for you.

Furthermore you must set up an access token from within your NetSuite environment that combines the Integration Record with a User. This could be done assuming that your NetSuite account has the required permissions enabled in order to generate such tokens and login using them.

Refer to NetSuite's Help Center or SuiteAnswers for detailed information on how to navigate NetSuite and set this up.

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]

|Parameter |Description
|Consumer Key |Enter the consumer key value for the token based authentication enabled integration record being used.
|Consumer Secret |Enter the consumer secret value for the token based authentication enabled integration record being used.
|Token Id |Enter the token id representing the unique combination of a user and integration generated within the NetSuite environment.
|Token Secret |Enter the respective token secret for the user/integration pair.

|Connection Timeout |Enter the amount of time, in milliseconds, that the client must attempt to establish a connection before timing out.
|Receive Timeout |Enter the amount of time, in milliseconds, that the client must wait for a response before timing out.
|Enable DataSense |If you select this option, DataSense extracts metadata for NetSuite standard objects to automatically determine the data type and format that your application must deliver to, or can expect from, NetSuite. By enabling this functionality, Mule does the heavy lifting of discovering the type of data you must send to, or be prepared to receive from NetSuite.
|Endpoint a|
Enter the URL of the service endpoint.

Make sure that the endpoint uses the version of NetSuite that the connector supports.

|Separator |Enter the separator used to support the keys that are required to provide a better support for custom fields.
|===

== Using the Connector

NetSuite connector is an operation-based connector, which means that when you add the connector to your flow, you need to configure a specific web service operation for the connector to perform. NetSuite connector v7.2.0 supports 50 operations.

=== Connector Namespace and Schema

When designing your application in Studio, the act of dragging the connector from the palette onto the Anypoint Studio canvas should automatically populate the XML code with the connector *namespace* and *schema location*.

[TIP]
If you are manually coding the Mule application in Studio's XML editor or other text editor, define the namespace and schema location in the header of your *Configuration XML*, inside the `<mule>` tag.

== Demo Mule Applications Using the Connector

You can download fully functional demo applications using the NetSuite connector from http://mulesoft.github.io/mule3-netsuite-connector/[this link].

=== Example Use Case

The current use case describes how to create a Mule application to add a new Employee record in NetSuite using Login Authentication.

image::netsuite-flow-add-record.png[Add Record Flow]

. Create a new *Mule Project* in Anypoint Studio.
. Set NetSuite *credentials* in `src/main/resources/mule-app.properties`.
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
netsuite.email=
netsuite.password=
netsuite.account=
netsuite.roleId=
netsuite.applicationId=
----
+
. Create a new **NetSuite: Login Authentication** global element configuration and fill in the credentials using placholders:
+
[source,xml]
----
<netsuite:config-login-authentication name="NetSuite"
    email="${netsuite.email}"
    password="${netsuite.password}"
    account="${netsuite.account}"
    roleId="${netsuite.roleId}"
    applicationId="${netsuite.applicationId}"
    doc:name="NetSuite: Login Authentication"/>
----
+
. Click Test Connection to confirm that Mule can connect with the NetSuite instance. If the connection is successful, click OK to save the configuration. Otherwise, review or correct any invalid parameters and test again.
. Create a new HTTP Listener global element configuration and leave it with the default values.
. Drag a HTTP endpoint onto the canvas and configure the following parameters:
+
[options="header", width="100%"]
|===
|Parameter|Value
|Connector Configuration| HTTP_Listener_Configuration
|Path|/addEmployee
|===
+
. Drag the NetSuite connector next to the HTTP and in the Connector Configuration field select the configuration created in the previous section.
. Configure the processor with the following values:
+
[options="header", width="100%"]
|===
|Parameter|Value
|Display Name |NetSuite (or any other name you prefer)
|Config Reference |NetSuite (name of the global element you have created)
|Operation |Add record
|Record Type |EMPLOYEE
|Attributes Reference |`#[payload]`
|===
+
. Drag a Transform Message component before the NetSuite connector, then click the component to open its properties editor. Once metadata has been retrieved, select the respective fields to populate for the Employee. The DataWeave script should look similar to the following:
+
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 1.0
%output application/java
---
{
	email: inboundProperties."http.query.params".email,
	externalId:  inboundProperties."http.query.params".externalId,
	firstName:  inboundProperties."http.query.params".name,
	lastName:  inboundProperties."http.query.params".lastname,
	subsidiary: {
		internalId: 3
	}
}
----
+
. Add an Object to JSON transformer right after the NetSuite endpoint to capture the response.
. Deploy the application (right-click > Run As > Mule Application).
. From a web browser, enter the employee's e-mail address, externalId, lastname, and name in the form of the following query parameters:
+
----
http://localhost:8081/addEmployee?email=<EMAIL_ADDRESS>&externalId=<ENTERNAL_ID>&lastname=<LAST_NAME>&name=<FIRST_NAME>
----
+
. Mule conducts the query, and adds the Employee record to NetSuite.

=== Additional XML Examples

==== Asynchronous Operations

This code example demonstrates how to use `async-add-list` together with the `check-async-status`, `get-async-result`, and `delete` operations, using a custom record type.

For this example code to work, you must use a custom record type of your own (or just a regular type).

==== Basic Search

For this example, we set up a basic search operation for Customers (`CustomerSearchBasic`) with the criteria below:

* `companyName` starts with "A".
* The customer is not an individual.
* The customer has a priority of 50, which is handled by a `customField`.

Below is the Studio flow and the corresponding code:

==== Joined Search

This example here searches for all inventory items with a pricing join (ItemSearch) where the price rate is of 10.00. +
The search criteria is set within a custom Java component.

        pricingJoinCriteria.setRate(rateFilter);
        searchCriteria.setPricingJoin(pricingJoinCriteria);

        return searchCriteria;
    }

}

==== Advanced Search

The example constructs a simple Java component that creates a criteria to get the result of an Employee saved search in our NetSuite environment (EmployeeSearchAdvanced). Each saved search in NetSuite has a particular id. Here, we use the scriptId customsearch130.

        return searchCriteria;
    }

}

==== RESTlet Calls

NetSuite RESTlets allow you to develop custom RESTful web services for your NetSuite account using JavaScript and SuiteScript.
The example calls a script deployed as a RESTlet via the GET method. Here, we are attempting to get the CUSTOMER record with id = 700 using the RESTlet with script = 546 and deploy = 1.

== Connector Performance

=== Best Practices

==== DataWeave

The NetSuite connector’s DataSense capability coupled with that of DataWeave via the Transform Message component makes integrating with your NetSuite environment straightforward. For the following two examples, we use a JSON input string and extract the necessary data from it to form our NetSuite request.

This example code adds a Journal Entry to NetSuite from the following JSON input:

[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
{
   "tranId":"SampleJournal123",
   "subsidiary":{
      "internalId":"1"
   },
   "customFieldList":{
      "customField":[
         {
            "StringCustomFieldRef__custbodytestbodyfield":"Sample Transaction Body Custom Field"
         }
      ]
   },
   "lineList":{
      "line":[
         {
            "account":{
               "internalId":"1"
            },
            "debit":100.0,
            "customFieldList":{
               "customField":[
                  {
                     "SelectCustomFieldRef__custcol_far_trn_relatedasset":{
                         "internalId":"1"
                     }
                  },
                  {
                     "StringCustomFieldRef__custcoltestcolumnfield": "Sample Transaction Column Custom Field 1"
                  }
               ]
            }
         },
         {
            "account":{
               "internalId":"1"
            },
            "credit":100.0,
            "customFieldList":{
               "customField":[
                  {
                     "SelectCustomFieldRef__custcol_far_trn_relatedasset":{
                         "internalId":"2"
                     }
                  },
                  {
                     "StringCustomFieldRef__custcoltestcolumnfield": "Sample Transaction Column Custom Field 2"
                  }
               ]
            }
         }
      ]
   }
}
----


The "add operation for the connector expects a Map as input. Here is the DataWeave script to paste into the Transform Message DataWeave editor:

[source,dataweave,linenums]
----

%dw 1.0
%output application/java
---
{
	customFieldList: payload.customFieldList,
	lineList: payload.lineList,
	subsidiary: payload.subsidiary,
	tranId: payload.tranId
}
----

In this example, we use the same scenario for basic search as described in the previous section. However, instead of constructing the criteria in a java component, we transform a JSON string:


[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
{
   "companyName": {
      "operator": "STARTS_WITH",
      "searchValue": "A"
   },
   "isPerson": false,
   "priority": {
      "operator": "EQUAL_TO",
      "searchValue": 50
   }
}
----

Here is the DataWeave script to paste into the Transform Message DataWeave editor:

[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 1.0
%output application/java
---
{
	customFieldList: {
		customField: [{
			scriptId: "custentity_cust_priority",
			operator: payload.priority.operator,
			searchValue: payload.priority.searchValue
		} as :object {
			class : "com.netsuite.webservices.platform.core.SearchLongCustomField"
		}]
	} as :object {
		class : "com.netsuite.webservices.platform.core.SearchCustomFieldList"
	},
	companyName: {
		operator: payload.companyName.operator,
		searchValue: payload.companyName.searchValue
	} as :object {
		class : "com.netsuite.webservices.platform.core.SearchStringField"
	},
	isPerson: {
		searchValue: payload.isPerson
	} as :object {
		class : "com.netsuite.webservices.platform.core.SearchBooleanField"
	}
} as :object {
	class : "com.netsuite.webservices.platform.common.CustomerSearchBasic"
}
----

=== Tips

==== Search Operation

In NetSuite, the `search` operation can be used to execute a *Basic Search*, *Joined Search* or an *Advanced Search*. To this end, you need to instantiate one of these three search types for the record type you want to query:

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|`<Record>SearchBasic`|Used to execute a search on a record type based on search filter fields that are specific to that type.
|`<Record>Search` +
|Used to execute a search on a record type based on search filter fields specific to that type and others that are associated with a related record type.
|`<Record>SearchAdvanced` +
|Used to execute a search on a record type in which you specify search filter fields and/or search return columns or joined search columns. Using advanced search, you can also return an existing saved search.
|===

This also applies for the asynchronous equivalent of search, the `asyncSearch` operation.

==== Search Pagination Support

Support for pagination was added to `search` for NetSuite connector version 7.0.0.

The connector's search capability is now unified under one operation. Other search-related processors have been removed. Thus, `search` will always retrieve the whole set of results. Therefore users will *not* need to work with `searchNext` or `searchMore` in order to get the rest of the records from subsequent pages. The return type is also different; the processor will output a List of Maps representing each and every record obtained by your search criteria.

An important aspect to note is that pagination could not be applied to the asynchronous equivalent of `search` (`asyncSearch`). This is due to the fact that the actual pagination would have to be applied to the `getAsyncResult` operation. This would mean that only the first page would end up being retrieved asynchronously. Furthermore, `getAsyncResult` is common to all async operations. Hence we cannot even apply pagination here since the return type of this operation depends on what async operation was invoked.

Regarding the new *search* configuration, the connector is the same apart from a new attribute called `fetchSize`:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<netsuite:paged-search config-ref="NetSuite__Login_Authentication"
    searchRecord="CUSTOMER_BASIC"
    fetchSize="5"
    doc:name="Customer Basic Search"/>
----

==== ItemSearchAdvanced and ReturnSearchColumns

When using `search` the connector outputs a list of maps representing the Record objects returned by your `search` operation. If using an advanced search and the `returnSearchColumns` flag is set to true, NetSuite returns a `SearchRowList` containing the search results.

However, in the case of `ItemSearchAdvanced` the connector does not do this mapping and simply provides the user with the SearchRows. This is the case due to the fact that ITEMs in NetSuite can be of various types and we cannot assume the item type from an `ItemSearchRow`. This issue would also occur with any other record type that behaves similar to `ITEM`, but we are not aware of others.

=== Custom Field DataSense

In NetSuite one can add different types of custom fields and have these customizations apply to different record types. With DataSense enabled, the NetSuite connector retrieves and shows these fields. Note however that we do not fully support all the customization types that NetSuite users are able to define.
The following lists outline what fields we do and do not handle, and where they appear in relation to the record type's attributes. For the most part you can see that customizations are usually present within a list field called _customFieldList_, but in some cases these might reside elsewhere.
